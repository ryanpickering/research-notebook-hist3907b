so the poster i chose to take a look at was the red scientific poster by umo sangiorgi.

some pros to the design/how it works:
- an obvious understanding of the rule of thirds: 3 columns, and a heading, middle, and bottom clearly defined. 
- sleek design that comes from a knowledge of how to make gradients, etc. on the page, as well as nicely defined sections. aesthetically pleasing in that sense.

some things that don't work...
- the colour red is not something i like t osee in a poster - i believe it works against what the author might want to talk about because it dissuades people from reading it.
- too much text!!! unreadable, small, etc.
- diagrams in the middle are ugly screenshots - don't add to the conversation. 

i am struggling so much with editing this poster and it is sending me to the end of my rope. i'm losing my mind over here because inkscape is a very difficult program to work with on a mac because of different control schemes than a traditional program. what i want to change is the colours of the boxes from red to blue, but retain good gradients. this is practically impossible. 
i'm not going to lie, struggling with this is the last thing i need at this juncture with so much work going on and I AM GOING TO EXPLOOOOODE

alright, i figured it out and feel embarrassed. i just want to get this over with as quickly as possible now. 

okay, so i changed some of the colours around to what i thought was a bit more visually appealing. in the context of the final assessment of exercises, i would take this poster and alter it to give equal weight to the boxes that would represent a bit of a takeaway from each module and the exercises therein. though most likely i would rather find a better poster or create my own, not try to use one that confines me to certain areas and shapes and ways of presenting my information.
