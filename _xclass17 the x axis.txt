time!!!!!!

time imagined in charts as a static system, continuous, unidirectional, homogenous - this moment has the same value as that moment in easily separable points
what about people waiting for the bus with different intents, worldviews, etc. 
even daylight savings time!!!!!!! really shows that time is socially constructed 

visualizations need to incorporate this - can be critical to the argument being made. warp time, remember that time can be subjectivity

instead...
TIME as a FUNCTION of TEMPORALITY 
because time is relative. are discreet units of time useful for whatever project?

space as dependent on temporality as well - how can a map represent such difference? tiber valley map of dr graham - metropolitan mindset of rural italy

space as separarte from spatiality though - distorting maps to show information in a different way!
