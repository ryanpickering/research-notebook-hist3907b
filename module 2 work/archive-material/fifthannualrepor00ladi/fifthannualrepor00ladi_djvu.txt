""'TIS liberty alone that gives the flower 
Of fleeting life, its lustre and perfume ; 
And we are weeds without it. All constraint. 
Except what wisdom lays on evil men. 
Is evil 5 hurts the faculties 5 impedes 
Their progress in the road of science ; blinds 
Tine eye-sight of discovery • and begets 
In those that suffer it, a sordid mind, 
Bestial ; a meagre intellect, unfit 
"To be the tenant of man's noble form." 

COWPER. 



REPORT. * 

In commencing their annual task, the 
Committee of the Ladies' Association, in aid 
•of the cause of Negro Emancipation, regret 
that the little they have been able to effect, 
during the past year, furnishes them with 
but few materials upon which to ground a 
Report. 

Although the Society has not been actively 
engaged in adopting means for the promotion 
of its Great Cause, yet we hope, from the 
willingness with which the subscriptions 
have been paid, and from the regular dis- 
tribution of the Monthly Reporters, (the de- 
mand for which is a little increased,) that 
the interest of our Members is yet undi- 
«iinished. Many of them, we believe, have 



the subject deeply at heart, and would sin- 
cerely rejoice, should an opportunity present, 
of more warmly espousing the cause of the 
oppressed. Whether these are of the opinion, 
that at present little can be done, or whether 
they may desire the adoption of more decided 
measures, let them persevere in exerting the 
influence they may possess, amongst their 
families at home, and as occasion may offer, 
in a more public manner; remembering how 
important it is, to keep the subject in view, 
amongst those who are convinced of the 
wickedness of Slavery, and to enlighten the 
understandings of others, who are yet un- 
acquainted with its evils. 

By referring to the Treasurer's report, it 
will be seen, that during the past year, £25 
have been presented to the London Anti- 
slavery Society, £15 to the Antigua Refuge 
Society, £15 to the Society for the relief of 
the deserted Negro Slaves in that island, and 
£5 to the Hibernian Negro Friend Society. 

Some of the Committee have lately had 
m affecting picture, of the state of things in 



the West Indies, brought before them, by 
receiving from a recent eye-witness, a de- 
scription of Negro Slavery, as it now exists, 
in one of the British Colonies. In this 
Island,* where the features of Slavery are 
comparatively mild, it appears, that, though 
the bodily wants of the slaves are tolerably 
well supplied, and though it may be the lot 
of many to possess kind and humane masters, 
yet the state of moral and religious degra- 
dation into which they are sunk, is dreadful 
in the extreme, and as the narrator observes, 
" nearly reduces them to the level of brutes.'* 

The proposals for reform, made in the 
Jamaica legislature, and negatived by a large 
majority, too clearly prove that no improve- 
ment is adopted there, and for further proofs 
of which we refer our readers to the alTecting 
cases of Henry Williams, and George, in 
No. 65, p. 356 and 357 of the Anti-slavery 
Reporter. 

Whilst, therefore, the Committee feel un- 
able to do much in a public manner, they 
♦ BarbadoeSf 



& 



would endeavour to impress upon the minds; 
of every Member of their Society, that slavery 
still exists, and not, as we fear many suppose, 
in its ameliorated^ but only concealed form, 
disguising under the mask of improvement, 
the horrors of a system, which the Christian 
Religion alone, should teach us to abhor and 
condemn ! 

At the Fifth Annual Meeting of this So- 
ciety, held at Devizes, September 17, 1830, 
Mrs. Slade, and Mrs. Waylen, were 
appointed Secretaries in the place of Mrs. 
Town SEND, who has resigned her office 
from indisposition.
