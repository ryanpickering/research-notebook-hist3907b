"* I Boston^ Dec. 6, 1S41. 

! — J A sense of private wrong alone, should not induce me to address you, and other friends of the Anti-Slavery catise, 

, I in the manner I am now about to do. But contrary to all my^expectalions and the professions and promises of the pres- 

"*/ ent nominal proprietor of " The Liberator," I have been deprived of all my former right and interest therein. I have 

long suffered private wrong ; and out of a regard to a cause and associates that had entwined themselves about my heart, 

I I have remained silent as injury after injury has been inflicted upon me, till now I find myself deprived, by treachery 

and duplicity, of that which was the object of my fondest anticipations, and upon which I had placed my latest hope. 

The climax has been capped, the Liberator, which money could not buy, has been wrested from me under circumstances 

which, however they may look in the eye of the lam, (and it is not now my objectld pass' jndgnient: on thele^lity of the 

transaction) should cover my former associate, Mr. Garrison, with shame, and his prompters and counsel with the 

brand of ineflable meanness. 

There is a long story to tell, relating l^th to former and recent transactions, concerning Sfty cofini?ction 'with the 

Liberator — the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society — the conduct pursued towards me in a great variety of things by 

members of the Masssachusetts Board^-the treacherous course of Mr. Garrison — the issuing of a certain " conjidetiiial " 

circular — and many wrongs and misrepresentations sent abroad — to all of which, as I before intimated, I have remained 

I silent through regard to old associates and the cause — and, lastly, concerning recent transactions, by which my right in 

I the Liberator is wrested from me, and all propositions and offers on my pari, such as the granting of ample security 

■* I that it shall be regularly published in as faithful a manner as at present, and any thing the most timid need to ask, are 

unavailing to regain my wrested right, and mostly through the influence of one merciless, hard-hearted, rich man. I 

have even been denied the most humble situation in the Liberator office, at a time too when Mr. Garrison well knew 

that I was absolutely suffering for the want of employment — this refusal was also more through the influence of the same 

person. 

Now I wish to tell my story — both for my own sake and that of the cause — to publish confirmatory statements of my 
friends, and a variety of documents and matters bearing on these and on collateral points ; and also to furnish a medi- 
um for others who have been and may be outraged, to tell their tales of wrong. The whole will show most clearly one 
thing ; namely, that however many inferior causes may have been at work, the great and overshadowing reason 
why there has been so much division and mutual alienation in the anti-slavery ranks, has been the selfish and deceptive 
conduct of Mr. Garrison and others at his-e!bows. 

The Liberator is no longer a free discussion paper, but has departed from its original character, and is the organ of a 
clique, always ready to puff and extol all those who will obsequiously bow to and profess the utmost faith in their res- 
cript — and as ready to condemn, as pro-slavery and enemies of virtuous liberty, all who dare express a doubt of its 
infallibility. Many well authenticated statements, to support this charge, will be made, Therefore it is useless for me 
to apply to it as a medium of communication with the public. I want to start the " true " Liberator ; and if it is not 
needed weekly, my design is to publish it occasionally, until I have had an opportunity of telling my slory, and such 
other things as will open the eyes of such of the people as are now blinded. I am resolved, if aided by the same power 
that sustained me in former in times, in my early connection with the Liberator, and bore me up in the conflict when I 
stood alone at the helm, in those stormy days of mobs and peril, to publish a paper, to be called " Knapp's Liberator," 
as often as there may be a call for it. The first number will be .issued in about two weeks, but I want orders for the 
paper, or money sufficient to pay the actual cost of paper and printing, as I cannot afford the expense myself — therefore 
this circular has been written. If you are disposed to contribute any amount toward the object, either of the gentlemen 
below named will receive it and be responsible for its economical expenditure. 

I have written frankly. Efforts will doubtless be made to misrepresent the facts and to forestall the statements— such 
efforts as will, perhaps, in some instancelfelmost deceive " the very elect." But all and more shall'be tnade oi(t if I have 
the means furnished me of publishing my statement together with those of my friends and others who may have been 
similarly wronged. 

KespectfuUy, yours &c., 

ISAAC KNAPP. 



The undersigned having been familiar with many of the circumstances relating to Mr. Knapp's connection with the' 
Liberator,— the measures taken, about two years since, to obtain it of him by lease — and more particularly with the 
method recently taken to deprive him of all interest in it — are decidedly of the opinion that he will be able to establish 
all he sets forth in the above circular. At the request of Mr. Knapp we have consented to receive all money which may 
be forwarded to us, and shall endeavor to disburse the same judiciously.
