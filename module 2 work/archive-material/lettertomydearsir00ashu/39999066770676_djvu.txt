For the Morning Star. 

A elioice sentence*for republican Slave-liold- 

ers, pro-slavery advocates, and lovers of 

oppression. 

The old patriot Samuel Adams of Boston, 
Mass. said, in Congress, " 1 should advise 
persisting in our struggle for liberty, though 
it were revealed from heaven, that nine hun- 
dred and ninety nine were to perish, and only 
one of a thousund to survive, and retain his 
liberty. One such freeman must possess more 
virtue and more happiness, than one thousand 
slaves— let him propagate his like, and trans- 
mit to them what he hath so nobly preserved." 
This language 
sentiment of the 
must he that they, who supp 
their fellow men infinitely worse in its nature 
and tendency than the revolution, can adopt 
it for their own. The oppressor may advocate 
peace, and rank in profession among those 
who pray for universal peace, hut he is at war 
with the slave — with his home, his wife, his 
children, his temporal and eternal interests — 
at war with his own conscience, the bible and 
true happiness — at war with his country and 
his professions of liberty. Nay, the oppres- 
sor is at war with all righteousness and jus- 
tice. Is it unjust, therefore, to put the above 
language in the mouth of the slave-holder?
