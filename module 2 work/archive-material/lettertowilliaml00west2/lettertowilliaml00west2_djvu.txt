Boston, April 18, 1836. 
Esteemed Coadjutor in the cause of Righteous Liberty : 

This is a great, an alarming crisis. Unless the most strenuous exertions are instantly made by the 
people of the free States, another slaveholding State will be added to the Union, thus bringing fresh 
blood-guiltiness upon all the land, and opening a new market for the traffic in slaves and the souls of 
men. Such barbarity, such impiety, is most appalling in contemplation — how much more insupportable 
in realUy i Already the Senate of the United States, with only six dissenting voiceo, has voted to admit 
Arkansas as a slaveholding State ! — Our only hope of effectual resistance lies in the House of Repre- 
sentatives. By information from Washington, -we are rejoiced to learn, that there is no prospect of 
getting the bill through the House sliort of Ihree or four weeks. They are determined to go into a com- 
mittee of the whole on it, and discuss it thoroughly. This is another Missouri question^ No pains, no 
expense should be spared to flood the House with remonstrances. Rouse up the inhabitants of your 
town — circulate petitions — call a public meeting, if practicable — send expostulatory letters to northern 
members in Congress,^&c. &c. Stir — stir, for the bleeding slave, the honor andv«Glvation of our coun- 
trj;, and the apprSljation of Heaven ! Immed!;\-i;e, is the w&tchword. Get as nany signers to the 
accompanying petition as you possibly can, in the course of a week at the furthest, and forward it 
promptly to our representatives. Observe^— it is not an abolition question ; it has nothing to do with 
slavery in the southern States ; it is simply and ex-clusiyely, whether we, the people of the United States, 
shall introduce and perpetuate slavery, in a new member.of our confederacy. Call, therefore, for sig- 
natures, upon abolitionists, colonizationists, unionists, all — all ! Delay not a moment. 

Respectfully yours, WM. LLOYD GARRISON.
