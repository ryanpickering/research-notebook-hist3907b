Whereas the institution of American Slavery is anti-christian and anti-republican ; and whereas its removal, in all human 
probability, will be hastened by a strong anti-slavery public opinion at the North ; and whereas our various relations to the 
South, Polilpal, Moral and Religious, are of a nature which compel us to act for or against the system, therefore the subscri- 
bers, residents of Leicester, with the hope of thereby advancing the sacred cause of Liberty, and with the fullest assurance 
that the blessings of Heaven will rest upon their efforts if they be faithful, unite themselves in a society to be governed by 
the following
