MASSACHUSETTS ANTI-SLAVERY FAIR. 






The Anti-Slavery women of Boston would again, 
by their Committee, call the attention of their friends 
in Massachusetts, and throughout the country, to tiie 
increased prospect of aiding the cause, by means of 
the ' Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Fair,' already 
notified to be held at Boston during Christmas week, 
1841. The receipts of the sale of last year, far ex- 
ceeding those of any previous year, afford ample tes- 
timony to tiie faithfulness with which tiie women of 
Massachusetts have discharged, amid much ' evil re- 
port,' the resp(msibilities they had assumed, and en- 
courage us AGAIN to summon them to unite with us 
for a still more strenuous effort in the slave's behalf. 
An appreciable impression has been made upon^this 
community. Many among us, who have hitherto re- 
garded the subject of human freedom with indiffer- 
ence, will venture to do so no longer. We trust that 
happier influences than we have yet known, may 
ligiiten our coming labors. We ask for reinforce- 
ments, that we may be better enabled to contin- 
ue our conflict with slavery, as well as to defend the 
territory we have gained from it. 

Strengthened by much profitable experience, by in- 
creased knowledge and resources, we hope to make, 
this year, a more valuable contribution than ever be- 
fore, to tiie Treasury of the State Society. It would 
bo unnecessary to state here tiie objects of the Massa- 
chusetts Anti-Slavery Society, or to enter into any de- 
liil respecting its operations. With these, our 
friends are familiar. But as our appeal may 
reach individuals not so informed, we would say to 
such, that, having deliberately and earnestly bound 
ourselves to the anti-slavery cause, we, as much as 
any othf-rs should be indisposed to spend our strength 
for nought; and we have carefully sought for the 
best mode of advancing its interests. A long and in- 
timate acquaintance with tiie Massachusetts Anti-Sla- 
very S<iciety, a knowledge of the strength of princi- 
ple, integrity of character, efficiency, zeal and disin- 
terestedness of its members, has assured us that in co- 
operating with them, wo shall most effectually pro- 
mote our object. The anti-slavery feeling in Boston 
is steadily increasing ; hoto long a time may elapse be- 
fore the cause so dear to ourselves shall be honored 
and advocated of all, we may not predict. We can 
only repeat our assurances to all, who have resolved 
with us ' to labor and to wait ' for the day of the 
slave's redemption, that we will spare no exertions 
which may promote the success of our common en- 
terprise. 

We entreat our friends to encourage us by their 
presence at the time of the sale as well as by their do- 



nations. Arrangements will be made for the accom- 
modation of ail who come up to our help, and no en- 
deavors omitted to make the occasion one of enjoy- 
ment and festivity, as well as of toil and responsibili- 
ty- 

So well is the Fair now understood, that a particu- 
lar description of articles tifat might be profitably pro- 
vided is unnecessary. Information will be furnished 
upon application to any member of our Committee. 

We ask anti-slavery societies to take early action 
with respect to the Fair, and communicate their de- 
termination to us. In^towns where no society exists^ 
or where having a name to live they are dead, let in- 
dividuals, who remain true to the cause, unite their 
eftbrts in this behalf. Permit us to say here, to any 
who, in view of our protracted struggle and unantici- 
pated perplexities, may be preparing to abandon the 
cause—' The numbers of the enslaved, their suffer- 
ings and despair, the crime and danger of the slave- 
holder, the guilt of his. northern confederate, are no 
less than when they first awoke your conscience, and 
enlisted your sympathy. Remember the declaration 
of our Saviour, ' No man having put his hand to the 
plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of 
God.' 

In many places, one laborer bears alohe the heat 
and burden of the day. To such we would say, be 
resolute and self-sustained. You do but seem to be 
alone. Within your call are true and faithful hearts. 

'hearts glowing with a flame. 

Kindled like yours for purposes the same. 
To cheer the watch, to daunt a common foe.' 

Help shall arise by your side soon, and at tho 
eleventh hour tlie ranks will be full. 

We shall -address to you, from time to time, durirtg 
the year, such information respecting our plans and 
arrangements, as may facilitate yours. Meanwhile 
asking earnestly for your correspondence, co-opera- 
tion and advice, we are affectionately your friends and 
co-laborers for the slave,
