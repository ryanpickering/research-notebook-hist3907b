AMERICAN 

ANTI-SLAVERY 

ALMANAC, 



FOR 



1889, 




EMANCIPATION, RUIN — SLAVERY, SALVATION 

A. West India paper, in 1838, says : " Institutions undreamtof in the days of slaver} 
have been founded for agricultural, literary and scientific purposes. New villages 
and towns are rising in various parts of the island ; new streets and houses are 
daily being erected in the old : and new churches and chapels are rearing their 
heads in almost every district of the colony. A heathen is now as rarely to be met 
with, as was a Christian ten years since. Hundreds of children are brought weekly 
to the baptismal font ; thousands are daily receiving the rudiments of education. 
The vices peculiar to slavery are gradually wearing away ; nightly orgies and 
licentious practices are fast falling into disuse ; concubinage is receding before 
matrimony, and the long night of superstition rapidly evanishing before the sun of 
Christianity." — " The West Indian." Spanish Town, Jamaica, 



NEW YORK & BOSTON:

THE FRONTISPIECE, 

On the cover, represents the present state of things, (Aug. 1, 1838,) in the 
British islands, — provinces of a monarchy — where slaveholders are abolishing the 
last vestige of slavery. The whip has disappeared, — the severed chain is laid 
aside, — laborers work, for wages — the father instructs his children — the happy 
mother clasps her own infant to her bosom — all are rejoicing. 

The picture on the title page gives a glimpse at the contrast exhibited by the 
free states of this republic. A woman having been punished for her misfortunes 
by being kept in jail in Philadelphia, is torn from her child, born in jail, and de 
livered, by a northern constable, to the exasperated slaveholder. The scene at the 
right, on the same picture, illustrates northern servility and the discrimination of 
prejudice. A respectable colored citizen asked admission for himself and children 
to a public exhibition where colored servants were freely admitted. He was 
not only refused, but eeaten with a cane for remonstrating with the door-keeper. 
Our prejudice, impiously called an " ordination of Providence," admits colored 
servants, — however ignorant, degraded, or vicious, — to closest contact, but furiously 
thrusts away an intelligent -Christian ! ! ! 

Another illustration of -the same truth occurred in Ct. on a cold dark night in De- 
cember, 1833. The mistress of the steamboat hotel at New London, turned from 
ijher doors three colored girls who had just arrived in the steamboat, TO because 
they were going to school. She said she should accommodate gentlemen travelling 
with their servants. 



THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY 

Was formed Dec. 4, 1833. In May, 1834, it had 60 auxiliaries, most of which 

existed before the American society r,as formed ; May, 1835, 226, May, 1836, 

527, May, 1837, 1006. May, 1838, 1350, including state societies in each free state, 

except Indiana and New Jersey. The Society received in the part of a year end 

ing May 1834, $1,048 05 ; year ending May 1835, $9,831 29 ; 1836, $25,866 30 

1837, $38,304 89 ; 1838, $44,094 07. Total, $119,144 60. Abolitionists 

have given less to this Society in 4i years than the nation has spent in the Florida 
war in 5 days, ($25,000 per day.) They can give and collect $200,000 in a year, 
all of which could be used, and is greatly needed to supply the increasing demands 
of the cause. Will they refuse to do it ?

ECLIPSES, &c. 

There will be two Eclipses this year, both of the Sun, and both invisible to the 
United States. The first will happen on the 15th of March, and the last, on the 
7th of September. The first will be total and visible in South America. The 
last will be annular and visible in the great Pacific Ocean. 

Venus will be Evening Star from the beginning of the year till the 6th of Octo- 
ber, and thence Morning Star to the end of the year. Jupiter will be Morning 
Star till the 3d of April, thence Evening Star till the 22d of October, thence 
Morning Star to the end of the year. 



REMARKS. 

"We still adhere to our plan of giving our astronomical calculations in apparent 
time ; and for the very good reason, that, so far as we can learn, our readers gene- 
rally prefer it. There are few clocks, and fewer watches, capable of keeping a 
uniform time, and where occasional adjustment, or setting, is necessary, it is much 
more convenient to have them keep with the sun, as they may then be set by a 
noon-mark or dial without the trouble of applying an equation. In the country, we 
like to determine the beginning and end of our day by the rising and setting of the 
sun ; and our noon, by the sun's passing the meridian. 

If you wish to set a clock to keep mean time, observe when the sun is on the 
meridian by a noon-mark or sun dial ; then if the sun is slow, add the equation, if 
fast, subtract it from 12, and it gives the true clock time. Thus you will find at 
apparent noon, Jan. 31, the true time is 12h. 13m. 46s. ; Oct. 31, it is llh. 43m. 47s 

In the present, number, the calculations for the sun's rising and setting, and the 
lengths of the days, will be found to differ materially from those for last year, as ai 
lowance is made for the refraction of the atmosphere and for the sun's semi-diame 
ter ; so chat our sun-rise and sun-set indicates the instant the upper point of The 
sun's border is on a level with the ocean horizon, under average atmospheric 
circumstances. 

We have continued our guessing at the weather, but would caution our readers 
against confiding too much in our prognostications. We would advise them to 
proceed in the business of seed-time and harvest without much regard to almanac 
weather, though founded on the experience of s-uch men as Doct. Herschel and 
Doct. Adam Clark. In addition to the guesses in the calendar pages, we will here 
hazard the conjecture on our own responsibility, that the months of January and 
first part of February will be generally milder and less stormy than is usual at 
this season ; — that the latter part of February, the month of March, and the first 
part of April, will be characterized by more than a usual degree of blustering 
stormy weather ; — that from this period to September, the weather will be of an 
unusually uniform character, giving a warm and favorable season ;— that the au- 
tumn will be generally warm and mild ; — and that the winter will come in rather 
ate, with little very cold or stormy weather to the end of the year. J. D. 

TIDES. 

In addition to the column giving the time of high water at N. Y. occasional 
remarks respecting the height of the tides are made in the miscellaneous column. 
To consider the subject more particularly, the highest tides in each lunation, or 
interval between two successive changes of the moon, are those which happen a 
day and a half, or the third tide after the change and full. These are called Spring 
Tides. The lowest are those which happen about a day and a half after the 
moon's quadratures, and which are called IS eap Tides. In the former case, the 
attractive forces of the sun and moon combine to produce the greatest effect on the 
waters of the ocean, and in the latter, the least, as these forces then operate in a 
manner against each other. These circumstances are again affected by the dis- 
tances of the luminaries from the earth and their declinations ; the greatest spring 
tides following those syzygies which happen when the sun and moon are in the 
equinoctial, and at their least distances from the earth. The highest spring tides 
therefore, happen about the equinoxes, and the lowest at mid-summer and mid-win 
ter. It is important to know when to expect these very high tides on account of their 
inundation of lands on the coast, and of their interference with some of the labors 
and operations of sea ports. We therefore insert the following table, founded on 
the formula of the distinguished French Astronomer Laplace. It exhibits the pro- 
bable height of the tides at each new and full moon, throughout the year, at the 
Jmost important places on our coast.

The first column is about the average rise of the spring tide, as given last year 
Examples. You wish to know the height of the spring tide following the New 
Moon of March 15, at Newburyport, Ms. You see above the figure (5) opposite 
March 15. You therefore look at column (5), and opposite Newburyport, find 11 
feet 6 inches, the height of the tide required. In the same way you find ffc a height 
of spring tide following Dec. 5, column (8,) to be, at Newburyport. l.'J.*. 7 feet 4 
inches, at N. Y. 3 ft. 10 inches, at Boston, 8 feet, &c. Though stnpv.s may cause 
a very great variation from the above table, it is believed that it will be found an 
improvement on any thing of the kind ever before published in this country. The 
tides at the different dates referred to in the same column will not be precisely 
alike, but, under ordinary circumstances the variation will in most cases be less 
than one fiftieth part of the whole rise of the tide.

Anti-Slavery Almanac. [1839. 



EXPLANATION OF THE CALENDAR PAGES. 

The important Anti-Slavery matter, adapted to the present state of the cause 
has claimed so much room as to urge to the strictest economy in the astronomical 
department. "We have, however, tried to atone for small type and narrow columns, 
by clear print on good paper. 

The 1st and 2d columns are the days of the month and week. The 3d shows 
the time of the Sun's rising and setting. N. B. A little practice will make it as 
convenient to find the time of sunset in this column as if another had been added, 
and sometimes more so. For instance, 2 minutes before 5, (See Jan. 31,) is much 
more intelligible than 58 minutes after 4 would be. The 4th column shows the 
length of each day, 5th, equation of time, Gth, the sun's declination, 7th, moon's 
southing, 8th, moon's rising or setting, 9th, High Water, 10th, positions of the 
tars, observations upon the tides, weather, elections, meetings of legislatures, &c.

NORTHERN LABORERS. 

You nave a deep interest in the principle for which we are contending. Southern 
statesmen now defend slavery, not on the ground that white men have a right to hold 
black men as property, but that LABORERS are rightfully the PROPERTY of 
capitalists. One of them told Senator Morris, (see his letter to the trustees of Pa 
Hall,) that it was "one of the unchangeable laws of Providence that one man 
should live upon the labor of another, and that American slavery was the best 
modification of that unalterable decree.'" By opposing abolitionists, you defend the 
principle that a nation's laborers and their wives and children should be ARTI- 
CLES OF TRAFFIC. In the following advertisements you may see the work 
ingof this principle, which you and your children WiWfeel, if abolitionism is defeated

"WHAT HAVE THE FREE STATES TO DO WITH SLAVERY' 

Majorities ride. The free states have always had the majority in Congress— 
consequently the power and responsibility. How have we used this power? We 
have maintained slavery and the slave trade at the seat of government 48 years — 
legalized slave auctions there — built prisons and hired jailors to keep safely runa 
way slaves and kidnapped'free blacks, and sold both for jail fees — adopted laws in 
Aiding death on a slave who breaks into a storehouse and steals jive shillings' 1 worth 
of tobacco, and ordaining, that a slave setting fire to a building, shall have his head 
cut off, his body cut into quarters and set up in the most public places — inflicting 
death on slaves for more than twenty crimes, not punishable with death to others — 
depriving free colored persons of suffrage and of the free use of the Post Office — 
and imprisoning such as have not a " certificate of register" and selling them to 
pay costs. (See Reps. Corns. 2d Sess. 19 Cong. No. 60. pp. 6-8 — also 2d. Sess 
20 Cong. v. 1. No. 43. Also Wash. City Laws, p. 249, and Act Cong. May 26 
1820.) We legalized the African slave trade for 20 years — gave southern "prop 
erly" a representation, by which S. C. with a white population 32,000 less than Vt 
has 9 members of Congress and 11 votes in the election of President, whilst Vt 
has but 5 members and 7 electoral votes — promised to send back slaves that flee to 
us. and to help their masters kill them, if they struggle for liberty. We robbed 
free colored citizens of jury trial by the act of '93- -denied naturalization to color 
ed foreigners by act Cong. April 14th 1802 — have made desperate efforts to re-en 
slave 10,000 Canadian freemen and to get Great Britain to deliver up all who flee 
[thither from republican slavery — (See Instructions of Mr. Clay, when Secretary of 
(State, to Messrs. Gallatin & Barbour ministers to Great Britain,) — surrendered to 
slavery all the national territory south of 36£° north latitude — added 7 slave 
states to the Union — bought territory to enlarge the slave market and to keep slaves 
from running away, La. for 15 millions and Florida for 5 millions, besides 12 mil- 
lions just spent in killing the Florida Seminoles, because they retaliated when 
slaveholders kidnapped their wives and children — made treaties to kidnap slaves, 
who had fled from us to other nations — chosen slaveholding presidents for 10 out 
of the first 12 terms — chosen slaveholding speakers of the House of Representa- 
tives for 25 out of the last 27 years — removed the seat of government from a free 
in a-slave state — passed a law, Jan. 1810, for the forcible removal of slaves from one 
part of t lie District to the other — made the direct, tax a lien on slaves,— (Laws U. 
jS. v. 3. p. 96—98;) and authorized the U. S. Collector to seize and sell them, and 
'f sold for less than the debt, "the Collector shall purchase the same in behalf of 
he U. S. for the amount, aforesaid" — (Act of Cong. 1813, Sec. 21,)— passed laws for 
transporting from one state to another slaves to sell, also for selling under State 
laws recaptured Africans — repealed in 1805 the act prohibiting the introduction of 
slaves into La. and throughout our national legislation have sustained slavery by 
the phraseology of acts of Congress, in which slaves are called " property," " arti-j 
eies," "(roods,'" " effects," " merchandize." Finally, Dec. 21, 1837, we voted thatj 
the petitions of 300,000 citizens of the free states should "be laid on the table 
without being debated, printed, read, or referred." These are a few of the things! 
which the free states " have had to do with slavery" in their political capacity, asj 
parts of the Union. Wc will now specify some things which they have done as 
separate communities. r I 

Most of the free states have been slave states, and in Conn., R. I., N. J. andj 
Pennsylvania, slaves are still held. Illinois has a system of 'indentured appren-j 
ticeshi'p,' a soft name for slavery. The Legislature of Indiana struggled hard to ma|e 
that a slave state — memorialized Congress on the subject. &c. (See Jour. H. R.| 
10th Cong. p. 44.) The states of N. Y., N. J., Penn., and Indiana, have laws au-j 
thorizinsT slaveholders to bring their slaves into the state, and hold fhem ; N. Y. 
for nine months, Penn., N. J., and Ind. for six months. In most of the free states| 
colored citizens are deprived of suffrage and civil office, and in Ohio, of fhej 
benefit of the school fund, and of their oath in courts of law. Though our ownj 
colored sailors are imprisoned in southern ports for their complexion. — though our 
white citizens have rewards offered for them by southern legislators, and are:

THE NATION'S ACT. MAN AUCTION AT THE CAPITAL. A FREEMAN SOLD 

As the District of Columbia was set apart to promote the interests and honor of 
the nation, its institutions should conform to the will of the nation. They do 
It is the jialioji's will that any colored man in the District should be liable to arrest 
and imprisonment, without evidence, oath or warrant against him, on the simph 
pretence that he has been robbed of his liberty, and even when this has been virru 
ally proved false, it is the 7iation , sivill that he be sold to pay the cost of this cruelty 

The following appeared in a Washington paper, July, 1834. 

NOTICE. Was committed to the prison of WASHINGTON Co., D. C. * ' 
David Peck. He says he is free. The owner or owners are requested, &c, or he 
will be sold as the law directs. JAMES WILLIAMS, Keeper of the Prison, 

In 1831, a free colored coachman, whose wife was confined, started to go for a 
midwife. He was seized and impT-soned by the patrol, notwithstanding his tear? 
and entreaties. In the morning iys .* vfe was found dead, — a victim to the nation'; 
cruelly. — See Letter from Washin^ron, in the Genius of Universal Emancipation. 

We will now show what the people of the free states " have had to do with 
slavery." And first, the preceding acts of their representatives were their acts 
and show their feelings. Further: when slavery ceased as a system in their respect 
ive states, many sold their slaves to southern traders. The fret stales monopo 

zed the African slave trade, and snatched at the price of blood up to the hour 
when it became in law a felony. From 1804 to 1807 little Rhode Island had fifty 
nine vessels prowling for prey round the African coast. Northerners now drive 
the domestic slave trade coastwise to our southern ports. We hire the slavehold- 

rs to rob the slaves by buying their stolen goods. Multitudes of our ministers 
teachers, merchants, mechanics, pedlars, &c. go south and become slaveholders 
presidents and professors in southern colleges, and influential clergymen ini 

outhern cities are mainly from' the free states ; northern families generally have' 

elations in the slave states, mostly slaveholders. Slaveholders are treated with 
more consideration than non-slaveholders — witness our watering-places, public 
dinners, political meetings, religious anniversaries, steamboats, rail cars, place? 
of public, amusement, and houses of worship. Almost all our pulpits are wide 
open to clerical slaveholders, and our communion tables to slaveholding profes- 
sors. Our religious and benevolent societies sanctify slavery, by soliciting its rob- 
beries as donations to the Lord's treasury, and they bribe slaveholders to persist 
in robbery by giving them offices, honors, and emoluments. Our churches, with 
few exceptions, have a " negro seat," where colored persons, even clergymen " 
churches of their own denomination, are compelled to sit, or leave the house. Al- 
most all our literary institutions exclude colored applicants for admission, while 
the sons of slaveholders are eagerly beckoned in. Colored persons, whatever thei 
respectability, are driven from the cabins of our steamboats and packets, from our 
rail cars, stages, hotels, boarding houses, tables, theatres, (except the upper 
gallery,) reading rooms, libraries, museums, and from the platforms of our re 
ligious anniversaries, from the learned professions, from literary societies and eor 
porations, from scientific and professional lectures, from military and fire compa

2. Immediately to prohibit the internal slave trade. 

" Congress shall have power to regulate commerce * * among the several states. 
Const. Art. I. Sec. 8, Clause 3. 

3. To abolish slavery in Florida, and prohibit its introduction in any other territory. 
" Congress shall have power to * * make all needful rules and regulations re 

specting the territory * * belonging to the United Slates. Const. Art. IV. Sec. 3. 

4. To reject all propositions for the annexation of Texas to the Union. 

5. To acknowledge the independence of Haiti. 

6. To join with Great Britian and France in breaking up the foreign slave trade 

7. To repeal the Act of 1793, which enables kidnappers to enslave free citizens 

THE STATE GOVERNMENTS 

Should be petitioned, (I.) to declare that Congress can, and ought immediately 
to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and the territories, prohibit the in 
ter-state slave trade, acknowledge the independence of Haiti, refuse to admit 
Texas, or any new slave state, and repeal the act of Feb. 12, 1793. This is im- 
mensely important. (II.) To abolish all law r s which graduate men's rights by 
their color. The principle of such laws is more detestable than that of any hered- 
itary aristocracy. To reward men for the good fortune of their parents is ridicu- 
lous, but to punish them for their looks is abominable injustice, and mean malig- 
nant spite. The following are a few of the cases in which this is done. 

1. Trial by jury. The U. S. Const, provides that " in suits at common law 
where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be 
preserved." Yet a law of Congress, passed Feb. 12, 1793, empowers any state 
magistrate to decide the question of any man's liberty who may be claimed as a 
slave. This manifestly unconstitutional law has been set aside in N. J,, Mass.

JOHN BULL'S MONARCHY A REFUGE FROM BROTHER JONATHAN'S SLAVERY 
Facts. Our GOVERNMENT has tried to enslave many thousand persons who 
are enjoying their inalienable rights in Canada. May 10, 1828, the following reso- 
lution was adopted in the U. S. House of Representatives, and as appears from the 
journal without opposition, or the calling for the yeas and nays. 

Resolved, That the President of the U. S. be and he is hereby requested to open 
a negotiation with the British Government, in the view to obtain an arrangement 
whereby fugitive slaves who have taken refuge in the Canadian provinces of that 
Government, rnay be surrendered by the functionaries thereof to their masters, 
upon their making satisfactory proof of their ownership of said slaves " — Jour' 
H. R. 1 Sess. 20th Cong. pp. 715 and 720. 



nies, from the jury box, and from all civil offices. They are refused all license; 
in most of our cities, and generally, the benefit of all asylums and public charities 
Merchants will not take them as clerks, nor lawyers and physicians as students, nor 
mechanics as apprentices, nor benevolent societies as agents. The people of the 
free states mob down discussion on slavery, and pelt with stones repentant slave 
holders who have emancipated their slaves, resigned honorable and lucrative sta 
tions, consecrated their lives to the advocacy of liberty, become exiles from their 
homes, and suffered the loss of all things. They break up anti-slavery meetings, 
burn the buildings where they were held, break open the houses of abolitionists 
and burn their furniture, put halters on their necks and lead them through the 
streets, drag them from their beds at night, bind, gag, disfigure, and transport them 
at the dead of night to unfrequented places. They tear down anti-slavery churches, 
break in pieces anti-slavery presses, and maim and kill their conductors. All these 
outrages have been perpetrated in free states within the last three years, and scarce 
ly one of the perpetrators has been brought to justice. Hundreds of other outrages 
upon the rights, persons, and property of abolitionists have been committed, many 
of them at noon-day — the officers of the law quietly looking on, governors, judges 
mayors, aldermen, members of Congress, and attorneys general, conniving, and in 
some instances openly aiding and leading. But our space fails us, and we stop 
mid-way in the enumeration. In the place of farther details exhibiting the pro 
slavery public sentiment of the free states, we insert the testimony of slaveholders 
lin the United States Senate. Hear them. 

Mr. Leigh of Va. in his speech on the abolition memorials, when showing the 
sympathy of the great body of the people of the free states with slave-holders, said: 
" / have never conversed with a single northern gentleman whose opinions on this subject 
gave me any dissatisfaction." Mr. Benton of Missouri in the same discussion, 
showing how the public sentiment of the free states favored slavery, said : " He 
confessed that he could find no words in the scope of language to express his admi 
ration of the conduct of the North. When he saw the spirit of the Northern States 
and Ohio also, which pervaded the whole mass of the population, he felt at ease." 

Mr. Preston of S. C. said : " Sir, I feel, with the Senator from Missouri, the mos 
profound respect for the talent and integrity, the ability, boldness, and zeal of th

and Vt. (in 1837,) and in Ct. (in 1838,) by laws granting a jury trial. Let the 
Legislatures of other states be urged to do likewise immediately. 

2. Continued Slavery.— In N. Y. slaves may be held 9 months, at one time ; in 
Pa. and Ind. 6 months ; in R. I- indefinitely as domestics. In Ct. those who were 
over 25 in 1784, are slaves for life. In N. J. children -ef slaves may be held till 
they are 28 In Illinois, the constitution provides for indentured apprenticeship, 
and speaks of the ' owners' of apprentices. Let their several Legislatures be peti- 
tioned to make all these states free by abolishing every vestige of slavery. 

3. Oppressive .Laws.— Ohio has servilely copied from the statute books of the 
slave. states some of their worst laws against the free colored people. She brands 
all colored people as liars, by denying them their oath in her courts ; — she exacts 
from them their proportion of the school tax, and excludes them from the benefit 
of her schools — thus taxing colored people for the instruction of white children. 

In Louisiana, the old Spanish and French laws have not yet been republicanized 
to such a refinement of cruelty as to rob a free colored man of his oath. [See 
Wheeler's Law of Slavery, p. "195.] Let the Legislature of Ohio be petitioned to 
rise to the level of slaveholding morality. 

4. Taxation without Representation. — In Connecticut, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois 
colored men are, by constitution, denied the right of voting for their rulers, and 
in New Jersey by statute. In New York, they cannot vote unless worth $ 250 in 
real estate. In Pa. the constitution now in force, [July 1838] gives to colored peo 
pie the right of suffrage. The constitution just framed by the convention, which is 
to be submitted to the people, Oct. 9, 1838, deprives them of the right.

A PRINTING PRESS DEMOLISHED AT SLAVERY'S BIDDING. 
The people of the free states have attacked "the tyrant's foe, and the people's 
friend,"— Oct. 1835, at Lftica, July 1836, at Cincinnati, O., Aug. 1837 at Alton, 
111. and finally shot E. P. Lovejoy, because he would not basely surrender " the 

LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, THE PALLADIUM OF ALL OUR LIBERTIES." 




leading men of the North during the last summer. 1 thank them for checking the 
excitement there as soon as they were able. 

Mr. Brown of S. C. said, " What are the facts as to the public opinion of the 
North on this subject? He had been assured since his arrival here, by gentlemen 
representing the Northern States, that an abolition discourse could not be deliver- 
ed among those whom they represented, without endangering the safety of the 
person attempting it." Mr. Calhoun of S. C. said, "He with others felt, as ought 
to be felt, for the open, manly, and decided course of a large portion of our north- 
ern brethren during the last summer." 

All this testimony of slaveholders was given in the U. S. Senate on the same&xy, 
Jan. 7, 1836, (see Washington Globe) and shows what the sentiments of the people 
of the free states "have to do with slavery," slaveholders themselves being judges. In 
the U. S. H. of Representatives, Feb. 16, 1835, Mr. Wise of Va. said, '« I appeal to 
southern gentlemen for the truth of the remaikable fact, that the emigrants from the 
north to the south are as ready to become masters as any who are hereditary masters. 7 ' 
WHAT THE NORTH SHOULD HAVE TO DO WITH SLAVERY. 

Now, reader, ponder the fads embodied in this article and learn what the free 
states have had to do and are doing not only with slavery but for it. Do you ask 
what they ought to do now ? We answer, What they never have done. — Act against 
slavery — denounce it, not as bad polic)* mere.y (slaveholders do that) but as bad 
morals — as a crime, always, everywhere, a crime in itself — an impious outrage on 
reason, right, law, justice, republicanism, man and God. Let them utter this and 
act it out — act IT OUT — Abolish slavery immediately on their great plantations the 
District of Columbia and the territory of Florida, where Congress has " power of 
exclusive legislation," and repeal the act of '93, which takes from human beings jury 
trial. Let each of them abolish slavery immediately within its own bounds — repeal 
the laws which permit slaveholders to bring their slaves to free states and hold them 
— demand the repeal of those laws which imprison our colored sailors in southern 
ports, demand the legal prosecution and punishment of the lynchers and murderers 
of our cit izens at the south — let them indict and bring to trial the thousands of northern 
rioters that have mobbed abolitionists, or instigated mobs against them — the magis- 
trates mayors, judges, members of Congress, attorneys general, clergymen and all. 
Let them repeal those laws which graduate men's rights by their skins — throw open 
to persons of color seminaries of lea-ning, churches, professions, trades, civil offices, 
public conveyances and places of resort, and all literary, religious, political and 
commercial associations, corporations, honorary distinctions, and public charities 
Let them expunge the pro-slavery dialect of our laws, and substitute therefor free 
honest w-ords. Let the people of the free states overwhelm with political retribu 
tion, those, traitors to liberty, who have cloven down the sacred right of petition

SCHOOLS, &c. 

Look well to your summer schools. They are the hope of the nation. Let 
your children be taught to love liberty and abhor Caste. Let none be excluded for 
their color, — either by the insults of the children or the vote of the parents. 

Of the 137,507 free people of color in the free states in 1830, 68,074 (nearly one 
half,) were scattered through 2,265 towns, averaging about 30 in each. Of course 
separate schools cannot be established for them. By suffering them to be shut out 
from your school, you are taking the straightest course to make them your enemies 
and. the enemies of their country. Ignorant men are prone to be the foes of law 
and order, but those who are made ignorant by an exclusive prejudice, will natu- 
rally be the worst kind of foes. The good conduct of the colored people under 
their disadvantages and provocations is wonderful. It shows that kindness on your 
part may make them your best friends and their country's most patriotic citizens 

Thou shall not respect persons." Deut. 16 : 19. " Have not the faith of our 
Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons." James 2:1. " If ye have respect to 
persons, ye commit sin." James 2: 9. 

In selecting your laborers for the season, do not forget to encourage colored men 
to form habits of industry. We can never do so much to raise them as we have 
done to crush them. Will you deny them an opportunity to raise themselves ? 

Slaveholders carefully observe our treatment of our colored neighbors, and they 
are glad to see us strive to perpetuate the inferiority, from which they argue unfit 
ness for freedom. Will you strengthen the hand which fastens the chain, wield; 
the whip, puts out the eyes of the soul, crushes the intellect and breaks the heart

COLORED SCHOLARS EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOLS. 
If the free colored people were generally taught to read, it might be an induce 
menttothem to remain in this country. WE WOULD OFFER THEM NO 
SUCH INDUCEMENT."— Rev. Mr. Converse, a colonizationist , formerly of N. 
H. now editor of the Southern Religious Telegraph. 

In those parts of the country where the persecuting spirit of colonization has 
been colonized, such exclusion has ceased. 



in Congress, and in the state legislatures, and frll their places with those who will 
reverence it. Let liberty be justified of her children ! Let churches shut slave 
holders o-ut of their pulpits and away from their communion tables. Let ecclesias- 
tical judicatories, instead of electing slaveholding moderators as the Presby- 
terian church delight to do, silence and excommunicate those who rob the poor 
et religious and benevolent societies no longer employ slaveholders as agents, nor 
elect them to office, nor invite them to make speeches at their anniversaries, nor 
insult God in laying on his altar " robbery for burnt offering," by systematically 
gathering into his treasury the plunder of the poor. 

Finally. Let all who buy of the slaveholder what he steals from the slave, and 
thus make him their agent and proxy to perpetrate robbery, to ply the whip and 
clutch for them the blood-smeared product — cease to be "partakers of other men's 
sins," and no longer incur the curse of God's indignant charge, " When thou 
sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him." 

Can any man in his senses ask what the north has to do with slavery, when a 
Virginia Senator, at the head of the southern bar, in habits of contact with the lead 
ing men of the north for 20 years, could say : " I have never conversed with a 
single northern gentleman whose sentiments on the subject of slavery gave me any 
dissatisfaction ?" 

Who does not know that every year our Saratogas, Ballstons, Niagaras, Tren 
tons, Catskills, Nahants, Long Branches, our hotels, public conveyances, prome 
nades, theatres, and fashionable churches are thronged with slaveholders, men whose 
daily business it is to steal the labor of poor men and women and children, flogged by 
a " driver," up to the top of their strength, — men who kidnap babes from their mothers 
and breed them for the market,— men whose glossy broadcloths and glittering 
jewelry and burnished equipage were tortured out of the forced, whipped, blood-wet 
toil of the unpaid slave— and yet the wealthy, the fashionable, the literary, the 
professedly religious of the free states mingle with these plunderers of the poor, 
lavish on them their complacent smiles, and choicest courtesies, accompany them 
on pleasure excursions, laugh, sing, dance, attend races and drink toasts with them, 
make parties for them, regale them on their richest wines and viands, give them 
public dinners, make them the orators at political meetings, assign to them posts of 
honor on the platforms of religious anniversaries, and call them to speak and pray 
in religious assemblies ? 

What has the north to do with slavery ? Just what the boon companion of thieves 
(revelling over their plunder, has to do with stealing, — what the accomplice in 
jcrime has to do with the principal — he who harbors traitors, and " gives aid and 
comfort" to rebels, with the enemies of his country. ;

HINTS TO ABOLITIONISTS. 

1. Do you take an Anti-Slavery Almanac ? I think so, else probably you would 
not be reading these hints. And I dare say you would not be without one any more 
than a hinge upon your door. But there is one thing more — do you take an Anti- 
Slavery Newspaper? If not, take one, pay for it in advance, read it, let all the 
family read it — then lend it — keep it going until it is worn out. 

2. Do you pray for the enslaved ? We don't mean once a year, or at the month- 
ly concert for the enslaved merely, but without ceasing 1 

3. Do you always carry anti-slavery publications in your pocket ? If you do not,' 
arm yourself with these pocket pistols forthwith, and keep shooting every chance 
you can get. Have one for a slaveholder, one for a colonizationist, one for a child, 
&c. Have them as you go to church, as you go to mill, as you go to town meeting, 
as you journey, as you ride or walk. 

4. Do you ever get subscribers to anti-slavery publications 1 If not do so, and 
send the names on with the money. Suppose you get one every week — 52 a year 
And it is easily done. Try. You will thus uphold the paper, encourage the editor, 
benefit the new subscriber, and probably set him to do as you did. 

5. " O, for a lecturer ! We never have had a lecture here." Haven't you ? 
Then lecture yourself, my friend. An abolitionist carpenter went from this city 
to Long Island. The people began to talk about anti-slavery movements. He 
proposed having a discussion to talk over the matter. A day was appointed 
He went to work and prepared an address himself; plain, good home -spun abo- 
litionism. It did execution. He had anti-slavery books, he had seen mobs, he

Anti- Slavery Almanac. 




COLORED SCHOOLS BROKEN UP, IN THE FREE STATES. 

When schools have been established for colored scholars, the law-makers and the 

mob have combined to destroy them ; — as at Canterbury, Ct., at Canaan, N. H., 

Aug. 10, 1835, at Zanesville and Brown Co., Ohio, in 1836. 



IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION. 
Aug. 1, 1834, 30,000 slaves were emancipated in Antigua. Without any ap 
prenticeship, or system of preparation, preceding the act, the chains were broken 
at a stroke, and they all went out free ! It is now four years since these 30,000 
slaves were "turned loose" among 2,000 whites, their former masters. These 
masters fought against the emancipation bill with all their force and fury. They 
remonstrated with the British Government — conjured and threatened, — protested 
that emancipation would ruin the island, that the emancipated slaves would never 
work — would turn vagabonds, butcher the whites and flood the island with beggary 
and crime. Their strong beseechings availed as little as their threats, and 
croaking3 about ruin. The Emancipation Act, unintimidated by the bluster 
traversed quietly through its successive stages up to the royal sanction, and became 
the law of the land. When the slaveholders of Antigua saw that abolition was 
inevitable, they at once resolved to substitute immediate, unconditional, and entire 
emancipation lor the gradual process contemplated by the Act. Well, what has 
been the result ? Read the following testimony of the very men who, but little 
more than four years ago, denounced and laughed to scorn the idea of abolishing 
slavery, and called it folly, fanaticism, and insanity. We quote from the work of 
Messrs. Thome and Kimball, lately published, the written testimony of many of 
the first men in Antigua, — some of whom were among the largest slaveholders be 
fore August, 1834. It proves, among other points, that 

EMANCIPATED SLAVES ARE PEACEABLE. 

Testimony. " There is no feeling of insecurity. A stronger proof of this cannot 
be given than the dispensing, within five months after emancipation, with the Christmas 
guards, which had been uninterruptedly kept up for nearly one hundred years— during 
the whole time of slavery. 

"I have never heard of any instance of revenge for former injuries." James 
Scotland, Sen. Esq. 

" Insurrection or revenge is in no case dreaded. My family go to sleep every 
night with the doors unlocked. There is not the slightest feeling of insecurity 
— quite the contrary. Property is more secure, for all idea of insurrection is abolished 
forever.'''' Hon. N. Nugent, Speaker of the House of Assembly. 

" There has been no instance of personal violence since freedom. I have not 
heard of a single case of even meditated revenge," Dr.Daniell, member of the Coun- 
cil, and Attorney for six estates. 

" Emancipation has banished the fear of insurrections, incendiarism, &c." Mr 
Favey, Manager of Lavicounfs. 

" I have never heard of an instance of violence or revenge on the part of the 
negroes." Rev.. Mr. Morrish, Moravian Missionary.

had employed a colored journeyman, he knew what freedom was by experience 
Couldn't he talk about liberty ? So can you. 

6. Do you teach your children what abolitionism is ? Do not overlook them. 

7. Have you read this Almanac through ? What a question! Do you suppose 
I would buy an almanac and not read it 1 Very likely, for many do just so. Read 
it now or probably you never will. Then ask every neighbor to get one and read it. 

8. Do you give away Anti-Slavery Almanacs ? Such presents go a great way. 

9. Are you and all your family regular and liberal contributors to the Anti-Slavery 
Society ? Can you not be a collector also ? We believe truth, spread by the use 
of money, will deliver the slaves. Those who collect and give are therefore the 
slaves' liberators. Will you- not have a large share in this work and its reward ? 



QUESTIONING CANDIDATES. 
Our batteries are pointed at slavery. Whatever political party crosses the 
range must calculate upon grape and canister. The right of voting is a sacred 
trust to be used for liberty. No one will get the votes of abolitionists who does not 
take sides against slavery. Let the following questions, or others equivalent, be 
put to all candidates for the U. S. House of Representatives. 

1. Are you in favor of the immediate abolition, by Congress, of slavery in theDis 
trict of Columbia, and in the territory of Florida ? 

2. Are you in favor of the immediate abolition of the inter-state slave trade ? 

3. Will you oppose the annexation of Texas, and the admission of any new slave 
state to the Union ? 

4. Will you use your influence in favor of recognizing Haitian independence ?

THE FLORIDA CODE OF LAW, 
TC To be sanctioned by the free slates if we admit Florida into the Union, while 
she cherishes a system which is both the offspring and parent of LYNCH LAW 
O AN AWAY, a negro fellow named BEN ; 18 years of age, rather thin in flesh 
M-ft^ &c. As I have traced him out in several places in town, I am certain he is 
harbored. This notice is given that I am determined, that whenever he is taken 
TO PUNISH HIM until he informs me who has given him food and protection 
and I SHALL APPLY THE LAW OF JUDGE LYNCH, TO MY OWN 
SATISFACTION, on those concerned in his concealment. A. WATSON. 

[See p. 25, and III, V, VIII, pp. 31, 32.] Florida Herald, (St. Augustine,) June 23, 1838. 



The general conduct of the negroes has been worthy of much praise. Their 
demeanor is peaceable and orderly." Ralph Higinbothom, U. S. Consul. 

1 There is no possible danger of personal violence from the slaves : should a foreign 
power invade our island, I have no doubt that the negroes would, to a man, figb 
for the planters." H. Armstrong, Esq., of Fitch's Creek. • 

The sense of personal security is universal. I know not of a single instance in 

hich the negroes have exhibited a revengeful spirit. S. Bourne, Esq., of Millar's 

"We have no cause now to fear insurrections ; emancipation has freed us from 
all danger on this score." David Cranstoun, Esq. 

Messrs. Thome and Kimball add : " The Governor said he had been well ac 
piainted with the country districts of England, he had also travelled extensively 
in Eerope, yet he had never found- such a. peaceable, orderly and law-abiding people 
as those of Antigua." 

" A gentleman in St. John's said he had long been desirous to remove to England, 
his native country, and had slavery continued much longer in Antigua, he certainly 
should have gone ; but now the security of property was so much greater in Antigua 
than it ivas in England, that he thought it doubtful whether he should ever venture 
to take his family thither." 

Lord Brougham, in his speech before the House of Lords, Feb. 20, 1838, speak 

ing of the slaves emancipated in 1834, said : "The slave has shown, by four years' 

blameless behavior and devotion unsurpassed by any English peasant, to the pursuits 

of peaceful industry, that he is as fit for his freedom as any lord, whom I now address.' 

EMANCIPATED SLAVES ARE INDUSTRIOUS. 

Testimony. " The most general apprehension prior to emancipation was, that 
the negroes would not work after they were made free. Time, however, has 
proved that there was no foundation for this apprehension. The estates were never 
n better order than they are at present. We can always depend upon the laborers. 
On account of the stimulus to industry which wages afford, there is fer less feigned 
sickness than there was during slavery. When slaves, the negroes were inces 
santly feigning sickness. The sick-house was thronged. After '34, it was wholly 
deserted. The negroes would not go near it." — Hon. N. Nugent. 

The Governor told Messrs. Thome and Kimball that" he was assured by planters, 
from every part of the island, that the negroes were very industriously disposed." 

" My people have become much more industrious since they were emancipated." 
— Mr. Watkins, of Dono van's.

5. Will you use your influence in favor of more efficient measures for the sup- 
pression of the foreign slave trade ? 

6. Will you advocate the repeal of the act of 1793, which takes away the right 
of jury trial when a man's liberty is at stake 1 

He who does not, with manifest sincerity, return affirmative answers to all these 
questions will be sure to lose the votes of abolitionists. 
STATE LEGISLATURES 

Choose United States Senators. Your vote for representative to the legisla- 
ture may therefore determine who shall be senator from your state for six years, and 
that Senator may turn the scale on a question involving the liberty of millions. The 
list, on page 36, shows when the terms of nothern Senators expire, but deaths or 
resignations may make a choice necessary at an unexpected time. For this, and 
other weighty reasons, look well to the candidates, for the State Legislature. Let 
them be called upon to give public answers to questions like the following. 

1. Will you, if elected, advocate the repeal of all laws which graduate men's 
rights by their complexion T N. B. This question may be made more full and de 
finite. See pp. 6, 8, and 10. 

2. Will you advocate the passage of resolutions declaring ; That Congress have 
the power, and that it is their duty immediately to abolish slavery in the Dis- 
trict -of Columbia? N. B. Similar questions should be asked touching all the 
points mentioned in pp. 6 and 8. 

3. Will you oppose the election of any man to the U. S. Senate unless you have 
good reason to believe he will heartily carry out the spirit of such resolutions?

A NORTHERN FREEMAN ENSLAVED BY NORTHERN HANDS. 
Nov. 20, 1836, (Sunday,) Peter John Lee, a free colored man of Westchester 
Co., N. Y., was kidnapped by Tobias Boudinot, E. K. Waddy, John Lyon, and 
jDaniel D. Nash, of N. Y., city, and hurried away from his wife and children into 
slavery. One went up to shake hands with him, while the others were ready to 
use the gag and chain. See Emancipator, March 16, and May 4, 1837. This is 
not a rare case. Many northern freemen have been enslaved, in some cases under 
color of law. Oct. 26, 1836, a man named Frank, who was born in Pa., and lived 
free in Ohio, was hurried into slavery by an Ohio Justice of the Peace. When of 
,fcred for sale in Louisiana, he so clearly stated the facts that a slaveholding court 
'declared him free — thus giving a withering rebuke to northern servility. 



" Throughout the island the estates were never in a more advanced state than 
they now are. I have frequently adopted the job system — the negioes accomplished 
twice as much as when they worked for daily wages, because they made more money. 
On some days they would make three times the ordinary wages." — Dr. Daniell. 

" On my estate, cultivation is more forward than ever it has been at the same 
season. The laborers have done well.'" — Mr. Fai^ey, of Lavicount's estate. 

" Emancipation has almost wholly put an end to the practice of skulking, or pre 
tending to be sick." — James Howell, Esq. 

" I find my people much more disposed to work than they formerly were. Tht 
habit of feigning sickness to get rid of going to the field, is completely broken up. My 
people say, ' they have not time to be sick now.' My cultivation has never been so far 
advanced at the same season. I have been encouraged by the increasing industry 
of my people to bring several additional acres under cultivation." — Mr. Hatley. 

" I get my work done belter than formerly, and with incomparably mo-re cheer- 
fulness. My estate was never in a finer state of cultivation, though I employ/ewer 
laborers than during slavery." — D. Cranstoun, Esq. 

EMANCIPATED SLAVES ARE EASILY CONTROLLED BY LAW. 

Testimony. '* I have found that the negroes are readily controlled by law." — 
David Cranstoun, Esq. 

" They are as pliant to the hand of legislation, as any people." — Wesleyan Miss'y, 

" Aggression on private property, such as breaking into houses, cutting canes, 
&c, are decidedly fewer than formerly." — Dr. I/iniell. 

Messrs. Thome and Kimball add : " Similar sentiments were expressed by the 
Governor, Hon. N. Nugent, R. B. Eldridge, Esq., Dr. Ferguson, James Scotland, 
Jr., Esq., and numerous other planters, managers, &c." 

In connection with the above, we present extracts of a letter from the Superin- 
tendent of the police, addressed to us, dated St. John's, Feb. 9, 1837. 

" The laborers have conducted themselves generally in a highly satisfactory man- 
ner to all the authorities. They are peaceable, orderly, and civil. ILrA due fear of, 
and a prompt obedience to the authority of the magistrates, is a prominent feature of the 
lower orders. To judge of the past and present state of society throughout the island 
I presume that the lives and properties of all classes are as secure in this, as in any other 
portion of his Majesty's dominions." R. S. W1CKHAM, Superintendent of police, 



1839.] 



AUGUST— EIGHTHTH MONTH. 



ABSTINENCE FROM SLAVE PRODUCTS. 
By denying ourselves the use of slave products, we give power to our testimony 
against slaveholding, quicken our sense of its guilt, create a market for free products 
thus securing a supply, and set an example, which, if followed generally, would abo 
lish slavery. Who that remembers the slave as bound with him, can freely consume 
the product of his blood and tears, eat the food which tantalized his hunger, or 
wear the cotton for which he went naked and scarred ? To the slaveholder we 
say : " Let him that stole steal no more ;" and to him that purchases the products 
of unrequited toil, Let him that encourages thieves to steal, by buying their stolen 

goods, BE THEIR CUSTOMERS NO MOFE. 

THE BAPTIST CHURCH IN AMERICA 
Sprung into being on the principles of liberty. Roger Williams and his perse 
cuted friends, and early followers, abhorred all oppression. " How is the gold 
become dim !" Sept. 1, 1834, Lucius Bolles, D.D. Cor. Sec. Am. Bap. Board for For 
Missions, in a defence of the Baptist Church, says : "There is a pleasing degree 
of union among the multiplying thousands of Baptists throughout-the land. * * Our 
southern brethren are generally, both ministers and people, slaveholders." 
In 1835, the Savannah River Baptist Association, deliberately invited and encour- 
aged slavery to trample on the marriage relation, by nullifying the first marriage of 
a slave if a slaveholder should choose to separate him from his wife. 

Baptists of the north, if you fellowship, such enormities, your " independent

UNPAID 




EMANCIPATED SLAVES CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. 

Testimony. " Since their freedom, the negroes cultivate habits of carefulness 
and economy." — Mr. J. Howell. 

" There is an increasing attention paid by the negroes to cultivating their private 
dands. They are very acute in making bargains." — Dr. Daniell. 

1 The negroes show a great deal of shrewdness in every thing which concerns 
their own interests. To a stranger it must be utterly incredible how they can 
manage to live on such small wages. They are very exact in keeping their accounts 
with the manager." — H. Armstrong, Esq. 

1 The emancipated people manifest as much cunning and address in business, 
fts any class of persons." — Mr. James Howell. 

' The capabilities of the blacks for education are conspicuous ; so also as to 
mental acquirements and trades." — Hon. N. Nugent. 

ANTIGUA SLAVEHOLDERS PREACHING THE FAITH THAT ONCE THEY DESTROYED 

Till 1834 the Antigua slaveholders cursed abolition ; since then, they have blessed 
t, rejoiced, and gloried in it. Hear their own confessions ! 

Testimony. " We all resisted violently the measure of abolition, when it 
first began to be agitated in England. But we are now rejoiced that slavery is abol 
hed." — Dr. Daniell, Member of the Council. 

" I do not know of a single planter who would be willing to return to slavery. 
We all feel that, it was a great curse." — D. Cranstoun, Esq. 

1 Before emancipation, there was the bitterest opposition to it among the planters. 
But after freedom came, they were delighted with the change."— Mr. J. Howell. 

"There was the most violent opposition in the legislature, and throughout the 
island, to the anti-slavery proceedings in Parliament. The humane might have 
their hopes and aspirations ; but they did not dare to make such feelings public. 
They would have been branded as the enemies of their country ! "—Hon. N. Nugent. 

"Whoever was known, or suspected of being an advocate for freedom, became 
the object of vengeance, and was sure to suffer, if in no other way, by a loss of part 
of his business." — James Scotland, Sen., Esq. 

Messrs. Thome and Kimball sav : " The Governor said that the planters all 
conceded that emancipation had been a great blessing to the island,and he did not 
know of a single individual who wished to return to the old system. . 

< Distinguished abolitionists are spoken of in terms of respect and admiration. A 
distinguished agent of the English anti-slavery society now resides rnbt. John s, 
and keeps a bookstore, well stocked with anti-slavery books and pamphlets. 1 he 
bust of George Thompson stands conspicuously upon the counter oi the book- 
store, looking forth upon the public street." -j j 

'Anti-slavery is the popular doctrine among all classes. He is considered an 
enemy to his country who opposes the principles of liberty. The planters hailed 
the arrival of French and American visitors on tours of inquiry as a bright omen, in- 
publishing our arrival, a St. John's paper remarked : ' We regard this as a pleasing 
indication that the American public have their eyes turned upon our experiment 
with aview, we may hope, of ultimately following our excellent example. 



1839.] SEPTEMBER—NINTH MONTH. [30 days 



churches cannot cast the blame on any church judicatory. Your churches are now 
a refuge for slavery. Rev. Basil Manly, a clerical man- selier recently preached in 
your Churches, in various parts of New England, and the scores of clerical Baptist 
slaveholders that, visit the north every summer, are invited to occupy your pulpits 
If you would enjoy the smiles of him who came to " preach deliverance to the 
captives," renounce all " fellowship with the unfruitful works " ofslavery, that you 
may, in word and deed reprove them. 

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THF PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 

Organized in 1789, adopted the " judgement" of the Synod of New York and 
Philadelphia, in favor of " universal liberty," in 1793, — adopted the note to the 
eighth commandment in its Catechism, calling those who " 'keep 1 '' slaves menstealers, 
and classed with " sinners of the first rank," in 1794. But as the influence of the 
revolution died away in the nation, the church became more pro-slavery in prac 
tice, and even began to renounce its former professions. In 1816, the Gen. As 
sembly, while it called slavery a " mournful evil," directed the erasure of its anti 
slavery note to the eighth commandment. In 1818, it adopted an "expression of 
views," in which slavery is called " a gross violation of the most precious and 
sacred rights of human nature," but instead of requiring the instant abandonment 
of this "violation OF rights," the Assembly exhorts slaveholders "to continue 
and increase their exertions to effect a total abolition ofslavery," with " no greater 
delay than a regard to the public welfare demands" and recommends that if a 

Christian professor," " shall sell a slave who is also in communion with our 
church," without the consent of the slave, the seller should be " suspended till he

SOUTHERN ARGUMENTS TO STOP THE MOUTHS OF NORTHERN GUESTS 
A northern man goes south, sits at a table loaded from the slave's unpaid toil, — 

who eats "his corn bread in the sun, — marries a slaveholder, and then finds out 

that slavery is a divine institution, and defends it in southern and northern pulpits 
religious newspapers, &c. For examples, — consult memory or observation. 



ILLUSTRATION OF THE NOW PREVALENT FEELING IN ANTIGUA. 

We insert a note from the Governor of the island, inviting Messrs. Thome and 
Kimball, the delegates of the American Anti-Slavery Society, to dine with him 

" If Messrs. Kimball and Thome are not engaged Tuesday next, the Lt Governor 
will be happy to see them at dinner, at six o'clock, when he will endeavor to facil 
itate their philanthropic inquiries, by inviting two or three proprietors to meet 
them. — Government House, St. John's, Dec. 18, 1836." 



STATISTICS OF THE BRITISH (FORMERLY SLAVE) COLONIES, 

Mostly from official returns for 1829. Slaves in Antigua, Barbadoes and Jamaica 
from returns of the Commissioners on Compensation, in 1834. Their returns state 
the whole number of slaves liberated or apprenticed, August 1, 1831, at 780,993. By 
he Abolition Act, the apprenticeship was to expire Aug. 1, 1840. Barbadoes, Ja- 
maica, and most of the other colonies adopted entire freedom Aug. 1, 1838.

should repent and make reparation." Since 1818, slavery has continued to nestlej 
and breed in the Church unrebuked.' A Presbyterian in the Southern Re- 
ligious Telegraph of March 16, 1838, speaking for his southern brethren, says : 
" So long as this law, (that of 1818,) stands unrepealed, we must either co-operate 
with the abolitionists of maintain the attitude of REBELS against church author- 
ity." Referring to the clause against selling a brother in Christ against 
his will, he says, it can ICP " never be carried into effect in our eountry ! ! !" 

Let all Presbyterians, of both schools, who agree with Dr. Ely, that a man 
should "starve, beg, or be crucified, rather than commit any one known sin,"im 
•mediately petition the General Assemblies which meet May, 1839, to carry out 
their own principles, and cease to uphold and encourage, by fellowship, the viola 
t ion of " precious and sacred rights." 



Text. "Contrasting the condition of whiteslaves in New England with our 
slaves in the South is like comparing Egyptian bondage under Pharaoh's taskmasters 
with Millennial glory. Mild slavery at the south is heaven on earth to the tyranny 
of the spindle at the north."— Rev. J. C. Posted of S. Q.

THE NATION KOBBING AN INDIAN CHIEF OF HIS WIFE. 
When monarchical Spain governed Florida, many slaves fled thither from repub- 
lican oppression, and found shelter. One of them, having married an Indian chief, 
their freeborn daughter became the wife of Oceola. She was seized as a slave, 
in 1835, by a person, (who had probably never seen her,) holding the claim of her 
molhei's former master. Oceola attempted to defend his wife, but was overpow 
ered and put in irons, by General Thompson, (our government agent,) who com- 
manded the kidnapping party. What marvel that an Indian Chief, as he looked on 
his little daughter, and thought of his stolen wife, vowed vengeance on the robbers ? 



WILL THE FREE STATES MAKE ANEW SLAVE STATE? 

They must do it if it is done. They cannot do it without enslaving themselves 
while they fasten the chains on others. We have already made 7 new slave states, 
with a territory IE?16,000 square miles larger than that of all the fjree 
states, which when as thickly settled as Mass., if proportioned like S. C, will hold 
nearly 20,000,000 slaves. These states use their power in Cong, to stifle the voices 
of states that gave them being, thus tramplingon them as they do on their own slaves. 

When the Constitution provided for the representation of slaves, it was sup 
posed that the South had not her share of power in the Senate, and that slavery 
would soon cease. Now, when 4,000,000 free inhabitants of the South have the 
same power in the Senate with 7,000,000 at the north, the people of the South 
have 24 representatives for their "property." In 1833, 3,797,577 free inhabitants 
of the slave states had the same power in Cong, as 5,854,133 free inhabitants of the 
free states, i. e. 2 at the South overbalariced 3 at the North, and this disproportion 
constantly increases. Thus we give them power over us as a bounty on slaveholding, 

If northern freemen were as largely represented as southern slaveholders were 
in 1833, 4,525,879 inhabitants would be entitled to our whole power in Congress 
thus leaving 2,450,965 virtually UNREPRESENTED, a population which, at 
the average of southern representation, would be entitled to 15 Senators, and 63 
representatives.* The effect, in all questions where freedom and slavery come 
in collision, is the same as if all New England and Ohio were unrepresented ! ! ! 

But why make Florida a slave state? Because, forsooth, it is the slaveholders 
will. Florida was no part of the original union. She cannot pretend that we 
have made a " compromise" with her, promising to sacrifice liberty and justice at her 
bidding. Till 1819, the territory being under the gov't of Spain, occasioned great vex- 
ation to slaveholders, by affording a " refuge" from slavery. After " protracted nego- 
tiations," it was brought under " republican" government, at a cost of $5,000,000. 

Hungry men-stealers soon snatched at their prey. Hon. Horace Everett. M. C 
from Vt. in a speech in Congress, June 3, 1 836, quotes from Gen. Thompson's letters, 
as follows : " Oct. 28, 1834. There are many likely negroes in this nation ; some 



The power of the North in 1833 was 2-|. — .*. f the Senate, +^40 of the House ? 

|-|i of the whole power of Congress, while by the census of 1830, the North had 
„.„re than -jifl of the free population. At the same time the power of the South was 
■ ?,oq , while her free population was less than -j-g^ of the whole. 



THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
In the United States, was organized in 1784, by the followers of John Wesley, 
its founder, who called slavery "complicated villany," and American slavery " the 
vilest that ever saw the sun." " Methodism at that period," says a Southern 
Farmer " was identified with the most deadly opposition to slavery. r 
Having previously acknowledged " slavery to be contrary to the laws of God,' 
they adopted rules to drive it from the church. But they yielded to the sin they 
ihould have conquered, and first suspended, then altered their rule. Still they call 
lavery a " great evil," and have rules professedly designed for its extirpation. But 
he Rev. Mr. Smylie, of Mississippi, asserts a notorious fact, when he says that these 
rules are "in the south, a dead letter." He also says that "if buying, selling or 
holding a slave for the sake of gain, is a heinous sin, then three-fourths of 
" the Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians in 11 states are 
of the Devil." In May 1836, the General Conference, of which a majority 
of members are from the free states, instead of condemning the horrible prac- 
tices and doctrines of slaveholders, passed a resolution, (120 to 14) over which 
Judge Lewis, a slaveholder of Louisiana, exults, as an "invaluable testimony in 
their favor," a testimony," says he, " which they could not have given if they had 
considered slavery a sin." They condemned those of their brethren who preached 
against what Dr. Clark calls "a crime for which perdition has hardly an ade- 
quate state of punishment," and disclaim " any right, or wish to interfere in the 
civil and political relation between master and slave." The Southern Conferences 
felt encouraged by this manifestation of sympathy with slavery to defend it as they 
never did before. The Georgia Conference, (Dec. 1837,) resolved that " slavery is not

A MINISTER ARRESTED FOR PREACHING AGAINST SIN. 
Dec. 14, 1835, Rev. George Storrs, who was invited to address the Anti-Slavery 
Society at Northfield, N. H., was dragged from his knees while at prayer by David 
Tilton deputy sheriff. He was also arrested in the pulpit, March 31, 1836, (fast 
day,) at Pittsfield, N. H., by the authority of a writ issued by Moses Norris, Esq 
Gov. Isaac Hill sanctioned the outrage by reappointing Norris. 



of the whites in the adjacent settlements MANIFEST a RESTLESS DESIRE 
to obtain them." "April 27, 1835. The negroes in the nation dread the idea of being 
sold from their present state of ease and comparative liberty to bondage and hard 
labor under overseers on sugar and cotton plantations. They have always had a 
great influence on the Indians. An Indian would almost as soon sell his child 
his slave." John Lee Williams, in his "Florida," published in 1837,though evidently 
disposed to conceal the worst part of the truth, says : " Great exertions have been 
made to get the Indian negroes away, by FALSE CLAIMS, and MANY negroes 
have been taken away by FORCE and FRAUD." The Washington correspondent 
of the N. Y. Journal of Commerce, June 3, 1836, says it was stated on the floor 
of Congress and uncontradicted, that our Government recognized the claim of the 
slaveholders, and sent agents to kidnap the children of the seminoles. 
Jan. 27, 1835, Gen. Thompson called for more forces, and the war begun. It has 
been protracted on one side, by the desperation of fugitive slaves, preferring death 
to slavery ; and the following, from a Mobile paper of March 28, 1838, shows why it 
is continued on the other. " It is the power to entice away and instruct m bush-fight 
ir,g so many of our slaves that we would wish to annihilate. These Seminole-s cannot 
remain in the peninsula of Florida, without threatening the internal safety of the 
south." Southern men have estimated the expense of this war at $20,000,0001!! 
Of its destruction to life, the Army and Navy Chronicle says : "Apprised as we 
have been of the DEADLY service in Florida in which our gallant armv has 
been, since 1835, engaged, we were not a little SURPRISED to learn the GREAT 
MORTALITY among its officers and men." 

Freemen of the north, have you done enough for slavery in Florida ? Will you 
strangle the honor and prosperity of your country, and bury them with your children' 
liberty 1 Let the north open her dumb mouth, — cut the string of her tied tongue- 
rebuke in thunder her doughfaced politicians, and make them warning beacons to 
the betrayers of liberty, in all coming time, — a certain sign of perdition to all political 
Judases, who impiously sell their masters. Let the people rescue Florida fro 
slavery, and secure it for liberty 

COLONIZATION. 

At a public meeting in Philadelphia, May, 1838, Rev. R. J. Breckenvidge said 
their cause was " too great to be managed on any one set of principles." Ac 
cordingly its friends deny, in one place, what they assert in another. Thus 

Into their accounts, the subject of I " Our efforts, our money, our plan3 
emancipation does not enter at all." — Af- | ALL contemplate emancipation." — 
rican Repository, {the Society's official or- Address of Colonizationists to citizens of 
■ Igan.) vol. 4 . p. 30 6. J Washington Co., Pa., 1836, 



1839.] DECEMBER— TWELFTH MONTH. [31 days. 



a moral evil," and the S. C Conf. (Jan. 18, 1838,) resolved that it is not a "proper 
subject, for the action of the church." The Baltimore Conference (in 1837,) parsed 

resolution defending the slave trade as not, in itself, wrong. Rev, Samuel Dun- 
Wody, in a sermon published at the request of the S. C. Conf. in 1837, says "sla- 
very is right in the Church." p. 19. 

But there are signs which betoken a- glorious resurrection of ancient Methodism. 
The first Wesleyan Anti-Slavery Society was formed in New York-, Oct. 1834, 
by Rev. La Roy Sunderland, consisting of 7 persons, when it was not known that 
5 Methodist ministers or 25 lay members sympathized with them. Zion's Watch- 
man was commenced Jan. 1836. Now 50,000 church members and nearly 2000 
travelling and local preachers, including a majority of 4 conferences, and proba- 
bly of 2 others, are decided abolitionists. The N. E. Conference has recommnjend- 
ed to tl>e next Genera] Conference (which meets May 1, 1840,) so to alter the disci- 
pline as not to admit slaveholders to the church. 

Of the 28 Annual Conferences, 16 are in the free states. Their meetings at 
which they choose Delegates to the General Conference are as follows : 

N. Y., May 15, 1S39, N. E., June 5, Troy, June 5, Maine, June 26, N. H., July 
3, Pittsburg, July 17, Black River, Aug. 7, Erie, Aug. 7, Oneida, Aug. 28, Michi- 
gan, Sept. 4, Genesee, Sept. 18, Ohio, Sept. 25, 111. Oct. 2, Ind. Oct. 23, Phil. [They I ; 
faeet also, April 3, 1839,]April 1, 1840, N. J. [April 24, 1839,] April 15, 1840. 
I Let all members of the church, who desire to "spread scriptural holiness over 
qhese lands," petition the several annual Conferences to concur with their brethren in 
New England, and petition the Gen. Conf. to comply with their recommendations.

|;;s if it had been done -with the cartwhip." — R. J. Brecltenridge, 1834. " I am ac 
Iquainted with several, who informed me that they received several hundred 
Jlashes to make them willing to go." — Thomas C. Brown, from Liberia, 1834 
I' When emancipated, the slaves should be colonized in Africa, or somewhere else 
i WHETHER THEY BE WILLING OR NOT."— Rev. T. Spicer,ofthe Troy 
(Meth.) Conference, Letter to Z. Watchman, Jan. 20, 1836. In 1836, when an agent 
|of the society was attempting to colonize 65 emigrants from Ky. and Tenn. 22 of 
them escaped, (at Pittsburgh, and at N. Y.) not having been made " willing " to go, 



The Societv has one principle, viz. a desire to get rid of the free people of color 
This unites all its members, and COLONIZATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
MOST ACTIVE WHEN COLORED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOST 
BITTERLY PERSECUTED. In 1831-2, Md., Va., N. C, S. C, Ga., Ala., 
Florida, &c, passed very cruel laws against the free people of color, and almost 
the whole nation seemed moved by the spirit of persecution. In the 15th Annual 
Report of the Am. Col. Soc. published in 1832, this fact is haiied in the following 
language : " The whole American community appears to be awakened, as by one 
powerful spirit, to the consideration and adoption of measures, for the more com^ 
plete accomplishment of the great objects of the American Colonization Society." 
The most rancorous persecutors of the people ©f color were the men whom Colo- 
nizationists delighted to honor. Andrew T. Judsox, in the midst of his perse 
cutions of Miss Crandall's school, was appointed orator and agent of the Windham 
County Colonization Society. The following language from the official organ of 
the Society shows its feeling towards the free people of color : " A race of beirgs 
the most debased upon earth." [Af. Rep. v. 7, p. 230.] " They maintain a preca- 
rious existence by petty thefts and plunder." [Af. Rep. v. 6, p. 135.] In 
the article last referred to (copied with approval, from the Religious Herald, ( f 
June 25, 1830,) the writer, after enlarging in defamation of the colored people, il 
lustrates the " missionary" character of the Society by saying : "This class of 
our population, it is the object of the Colonization Society to remove." 
| The " missionary" character of the Society, burlesque on common sense as it is, 
jis now trumpeted forth as its chief recommendation. Men who were " scarcely 
reached in their debasement by the heavenly light," are to enlighten Africa. Men 
jwhose "dishonest habits" exert a "malign influence" at home, [Ya. Col. Memo- 
rial,] their hearts inflamed by burning wrongs, received in a Christian (!) nation, 
^re to extend the triumphs of the cross. Have the colonization emigrants such 
ipre-eminent qualifications as to form an exception to the notorious fact stated by 
|Rev. Mr. Binney, at a recent London Missionary meeting? " All mere secular colo- 
nists, the whole world over, have been to the colored man, like the death blast of 
the desert." [See N. Y. Observer, Jan. 27, 1838.] Let their rum trade, their 
wars, their cannon balls spending their force " in a mass of living human flesh 
answer. Here space fails, but we need not enlarge. The united condemnation[ 
of colored A merican s is the society's death-warrant.

1839.] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 31 



STATISTICS. 

The foregoing table has been carefully nrepared from the best sources. The 13 
original states are marked 1789, the date of our present form of government. The 
particulars of the different kinds of population in 1790, and 1830, will enable the 
reader to see the comparative progress of each. In estimating the increase of the 
free colored inhabitants of the free states, the slaves of those states munt of course 
be added to the number for 1790. We have left out the territories entirely, as we 
could not obtain accurate returns from Wisconsin and Iowa. We have thus given 
a fair comparison of the free and .slave states. In 1830, Florida, with 55,680 square 
miles, had 18,385 free whites, 844 free colored persons, and 15.501 slaves. 

The increase of slaves in the slave states, was, from 1790 to 1800, 30.4 per cent ; 
from 1800 to 1810, 35.S ; from lblO to 1820, 30.5 ; from 1820 to 1830, 31 per cent; 
showing that the slaves in the .slave states have increased faster since the slave 
trade was abolished than from 1790 to 1800. 

In the column headed " Extent," the reader will see that the slave states have 
nearly twice as much territory as the free. The column headed " I. to s. m.,' 
shows the whole number of inhabitants to a square mile. The free inhabitants in 
he slave states average about 6 to a sq. mile. The next column shows that the 
slaves in 1830 exceeded the whites in two states. A later census shows an excess 
of 20,000 in Mississippi. The next two columns contrast the present apportion 
ment of representatives with what it would be, if the present number were appor 
ioned on the basis of the free population only, by which we may see how large 
a part of our own just eights in the U. S. H. R. we have given to slavery. The 
contrast between the two columns is increased by the fact that the Representati 
number (47,700) fixed bv Cong, in 183 J. left 263,000 free persons at the north un- 
represented. Of these Vt. has 42,157, Ms. 38,000, N. J. 33,000, Ohio 31,000, &e 
If 42,750 free persons sent, one lepreson'ativr, the total (242) would be the same, 
and the fractions less. The estimate for 1840, is probably noi very far from the 
truth. Wherever a census has been taken since 1830, it has, (excei>t in N. Y.) 
shown a more rapid increase, both of slaves and free persons, than from 1820 to 1830,

A PEEP AT SLAVERY. 

[. A JAIL PREFERRED TO slavery. " The tender care and protection of the 

master elicit an affectionate attachment from the slave, which will be looked for in 

vain from the hiroil servant of a more northern clime.'' — Charleston Courier. 

REWARD — Ranaway a negro man named JOHNSON : he has 
a GOOD MANY MARKS of the WHIP on his back: he was 
confined in jail last summer ; lav once in jail six months, within ten miles of his 
naster, but would not tell his name. CORNELIUS D. TOBIN. 

[Mobile Morning Chronicle, June 8, 1838.] 

II. Hard TO catch. A circle of relatives famous for " affectionate attachment." 
REWARD will be paid by the subscriber to who 
ever will put in jail, HER negro woman MILLY. 

She is an old hand at running away, and tolerably hard to 
catch, being once concealed 9 months in this Borough, and at 
another time one year. She is wife to one Daniel Murray, has 
numerous relations about town, all from report 'quick on the heel.' 
The law will be strictly enforced against any one secreting 
harboring, or carrying awav said slave. A. FAUQUIER. 
[Am. Beacon, (Norfolk, Va.) Sept. 15, 1836. 

Think of a woman scornfully threatening vengeance on any 
one who shall shelter a defenceless wife. 

III. A carpenter branded. " Civilization and Christianity have spread over 
it (slavery,) their humanizing influences." — Charleston Courier. 

P&I1 REWARD for the delivery of my fellow EDWARD, in Jacksonville 

09%W J]. F. ; has a scar near the corner of his mouth ; he has two cuts on his 

hand and arm — a carpenter by trade — the letter E, and some other letters not re 

collected on his arm— about 19 years of age. THOMAS. LEDWITH. 

Jacksonville, E. F. May 25, 1838. [Darien (Ga.) Telegraph, June 5, 1KJ8. 

This youth of 19, marked, cut, and branded with several letters, if retaken 

ill be held under the authority of the United States Government, by those who 

compel him to work without wages. Reader, if you do not oppose the admission of 

Florida as a slave state, you SANCTION SOCH ENORMITIES. 



32 Anti-Slavery Almanac. [18&9 




IV. A " dog collar" used to enforce " contentment ! !" " Slavery with 
us is a parental relation." — Charleston Courier. 

RAN AWAY, a negro boy named LONDON, about 12 years old; had round 
his neck when he left, a chain dog collar, with " De Yampert" engraved on 
it. March 3. [Mobile Morning Chronicle, May 21, 1838.] T. J. DE YAMPERT. 

V. " Domestic institutions" divided against themselves. 
£&2ft REWARD — Ranaway a negro man named HARRISON. It is sup- 

*?" posed that he will make for South Carolina in pursuit of his wife, in 
possession of Capt. D. Bird. CORNELIUS BEAZLY. 

[Florida Watchman, Tallahasse, May 12, 1838. Motto, " Principle and the People."] 

VI. Public murder — " The only legitimate object of gov't is to secure to each 
individual the enjoyment of LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These 
cannot be forfeited without crime." — Mississippian, June 8, 1838. 

^ ~I_ CI O * S su53SCr i be< *> anu w ^ be punctually paid by the citizens of Onslow, 
^ to any person who may safely confine in any jail in this State, a 

certain negro man, named ALFRED. The same reward will" be paid, if satisfac- 
tory evidence is given of his having been KILLED. He has one or more scars 
caused by his having been SHOT. THE CITIZENS OF ONSLOW. 

[Wilmington (N. C.) Advertiser, June 1, 1838. Motto, " Be just and fear not."] 
In the same paper is a proclamation offering a reward to any one who will mur- 
der a husband for attempting to join his stolen wife. Read it. " Domestic slavery 
contributes to form and preserve the chivalrous and highminded character of our 
people, and gives to the African race, domesticated among us, Christianity, civ- 
ilization, and peace." — Charleston Courier. 

RANAWAY my negro man RICHARD. A reward of $25 will 
be paid for his apprehension DEAD OR ALIVE. Satis- 
factory proof will only be required of his being KILLED. He 
has with him in all probability, his wife ELIZA, who ran away 
from Col. Thompson, now a resident of Alabama, about the time he 
commenced his journey to that State. DURANT H. RHODES. 
These facts, and scores like them, are coolly spread out in southern newspapers, 
— quite too common occurrences for comment. " Shall I not visit for these things ? 
saith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?" 

VII. The United States Government a partner in robbery and' 
sharing the plunder. Here we see our republican government, by their 
agent, driving the mpanest kind of robbery, forcing poor men to work without 
wages. " The privileges, civil and religious, of the humblest individual, are sa- 
credly protected." — President Van Bureri 1 's 'Message, March 4, 1837. 

" Slavery is not a national question at all." — R. J. Breckenridge. 
NS&BOES WANTS©. 

THE undersigned wishes to hire SIX NEGRO MEN, to work on the U. S. 
Arsenal to be erected at Little Rock. Liberal wages will be paid for good 
working hands. I also wish to purchase a good OX, well broke to the off-side, &c. 
Little Rock Arsenal, Feb. 5, 1838. R. B. LEE, Bt. Maj. U. S. A. 

[Times and Advocate, Little Rock, Ark. April 2, 1838. 
After his day's work, we will suppose one of these " good working hands " meets 
our democratic president, and holds the following dialogue. Laborer. I understand 
I have been working for the government to-day, shall I be paid ? P^es. No ; you 
are a slave : — we pay your master. Laborer. You know my master does not pay 
me. Is this the way you show your love for the working classes, by forcing me 
to work for nothing, and paying money to the man that robs me of my earnings ? 

VIII. The United States Navy a slave-catcher. 

TAKEN up and delivered into my custody, a negro man named ISAAC. Was 
taken up by the boats of the Boston slocp of war at the mouth of the Manitee 
River, South Florida — says he was sold by a Mr. Roberts of Norfolk, Va., to a slave 
dealer, and that in passing through Florida, he made his escape. The owner is re- 
quested, &c. or he will be dealt with as the law directs. HENRY J. WIGGINS 

[Pensacola Gazette, May 19, 1838. 
In the same paper Mr. Wiggins advertises Jacob in precisely the same language. 
Here we see two men, easting themselves upon the ocean to "escape from slavery 
under the U. S. Government, and men paid, by us, seize them, and "deliver" 
them to be kept in jail for the ''■owner," or sold for jail fees.

In the Senate the North had a majority of 2, (except from 1796 to 1802,) till 1812, 
when the admission of Louisiana equalized the representation in that body. Still 
the North, having power to choose the Vice-president, may have the casting vote. 
It follows that every act of the nation is an act of the free states. They 
are virtually the nation. Whatever Congress does, or refuses to do, the 
final responsibility rests upon the free states. The only way to absolve ourselves 
from the guilt and shame of our national crimes is to discard those who perpetrate 
them, and choose men to represent us who will not vote down the foundation prin- 
ciples of our government. To assist northern freemen in this work, we insert 
from the Congressional journals the names of a few who have voted against liberty.

The Missouri question came up Feb. 2, 1818, and was finally settled in the 
House, Fob. 26, [Senate 28,] 1821. For names, see opposite page. 

The marks designate the votes of northern Representatives, as follows : 
* Feb. 16, 1819. Against a clause prohibiting the further introduction of slavery 

into Mo. Carried, (i. e. the clause against slavery prevailed,) yeas 87, nays 76. 
t Against a clause for the future emancipation (at 25) of slaves born in the state 

Carried, yeas 82, nays 78. 
11 Feb. 18, 1819. Against a clause prohibiting the future introduction of slavery 

into Arkansas. Lost, yeas 70, nays 71. 

| Against the future emancipation of slaves born in Ark. Carried, yeas 75, nays 73. 

i For reconsidering last vote. Lost, yeas 77, nays 79. 

flf Feb. 19, 1819. Against the future emancipation of slaves born in Arkansas. 

Tried twice (in different forms) the same day. First trial, there was a tie, 88 

to 88, and HENRY CLAY,* of Kentucky, gave the casting vote in favor of 

perpetual slavery. The second trial, it was carried, yeas 89, nays 87. 

§ Same day. Against prohibiting the further introduction of slavery into Ark. (Mr 

Taylor of N.Y. having renewed his proposition lost on the 18th.) Lost, y. 86, n. 90 

K7 March 2, 1820. For striking out the clause prohibiting the extension of slavery 

in Missouri. Carried, yeas 90, nays 87. This was the test question, in deciding 

which, nineteen northern men bartered their own characters, the rights of the 

North, and the liberty of unborn thousands for an understanding that 

no new slave state should afterwards be admitted, extending north of the south 
line of Missouri. Any two in the House might have turned the scale. Those 
marked thus, (s~TJ) have been since re-elected, (the figures show how many times) 
their constituents thus assuming their GUILT AND SHAME.

PRO-SLAVERY OBJECTIONS. 

The doctrines of abolitionists are self-evident truths ; their measures are these 
doctrines acted out. If there were no other proof of the truth of our doctrines, than 
the absurdity of all the objections made to them, they might well be considered 
settled. When intellect and passion from the chair of state, the bench and the 
pulpit, down to the ditch, have joined forces against our principles, — when pride, 
caste, lust of power, political corruption, ecclesiastical usurpation, and dogma- 
tism, on the one hand, and truckling sycophancy on the other, have been put to 
their possibles in self-defence ; when our doctrines have for years poured such a 
raking fire into their very thickets and nestling places, and smote with such a 
ruining hand among their lifted crests, and through their joints and marrow, as to ! 
keep them in ceaseless throes, and goad them to their utmost in aggression, if after 
all the joint product of all these be mere puerility and emptiness, our principles may 
.be regarded as among " the things that cannot be shaken." We speak of these ob 
|jections just as we feel. Not one of them has in it even the elements of an argument 
They are shallow, sophistical, contradictory, generally mere assumptions, always 
rife with ignorance, and often with falsehood. We leave it with the next genera 
tion to say if this be a false accusation. But further preface aside, we proceed to 
notice some of the reasons urged against the emancipation of the slaves. Slave 
holders will have it that slaves are contented and happy. 

ARE SLAVES CONTENTED AND HAPPY? 

The question is not, what is the actual condition of slaves ? but, how do they re 
gard it ? — what feelings does it produce in them ? — do they like it, or dislike it ? To 
argue such a question seems like playing a farce, and yet there is so much prating 
about the contentment and happiness of slaves, that many take it for granted, and 
help slaveholders to ring the changes upon the absurdity, ridiculous and shallow as 
it is. Yet no man in his senses really believes that slaves are contented and happy. 
The phraseology which men use every day in talking upon a subject, often shows 
their real opinions better.than any formal declaration of them. The very men who 
tell us that the slave is contented, that he is willing to be a slave, will in nine cases 
out of ten, if called upon to define slavery, say it is involuntary servitude, that is, 
that the slave works against his will. Let any man analyze his own associations 
with the word slave, and he will find that he invariably associates with it the idea 
of a person kept in a condition against his will. Let him try to contemplate slavery 
as a condition into which men go of their own accord, and the slave as one choosing 
to become such in preference to being a freeman, and he will find himself doing as 
great violence to his convictions, as if he should try to contemplate convicts in 
solitary cells, as persons who had broken into them c it of sheer love to handcuffs 
and a dungeon for life, six feet by four, in preference to going at large. How can 
slaves be contented and happy, when the first step in the process that makes them 
slaves, is to take them from under the direction of their own free wills, and mo 
all the machinery of their bodies and minds by a mainspring out of themselves ? A 
man's own will is the natural mainspring for moving all the machinery of his body 
and mind ; to propel it by any other moving power makes every part grate with 
friction. Would a watchmaker be such a fool as to put into a watch a power act- 
ing against the mainspring, forcing the wheels in one direction, while that pushed 
in the other? Every piece of mechanism has its own moving power ; when its 
movements are directed by that power, all is harmony ; when by any other power 
acting against that, all is jargon. The first desire of human nature is to direct its 
own movements. To say that a man can be contented and happy, while all his 
movements are directed by the will of another, is to prate nonsense. Unsatisfied

desire is, so far as it goes, unhappiness, and if permanent, and embracing a variety 
of objecrs, is misery. The first desire of the slave, like that of all other men, is to 
use his own body and mind, and to control their movements. This desire is counter- 
ed every moment ; all his movements are controlled by another. He does, not 
what he likes, but what another likes to have him do. He goes, not where he wills, 
but whithersoever his master wills. He eats what his master pleases. The quality, 
quantity, time of meals, and number each day, are as the master likes to hare 
them. He wears such clothes, of such texture, color, cut r &c. as the master] 
pleases. His limes of labor and rest, accommodations in sickness, his whole in- 
tercourse with wife, children, and friends ; the place of his abode, when and how 
he may leave, or change it, the improvement of his mind, the exercise of his con- 
science, the use of his limbs, yea even of his voice and of his five senses, all these 
are under the control, and subject to the momentary caprice of another. His own 
will must be constantly counteracted, and he consequently unhappy, not merely 
because the thousand momentary wishes of every day are frustrated, but because 
the great, permanent, constitutional desire of his being, to use himself for the ad- 
vancement of his own interests is all the time counteracted. To call such a man 
happy, is to prostitute language and libel human nature. 

MEN DON'T LOVE TO WORK. 

But again : no man ever loved work fcr its own sake. It is human nature to 
shrink from labor, unless something is to be got by it beyond the mere labor. The 
muscular effort itself, unless casual and temporary, is always regarded with aver- 
sion. True, men work, and are happy in working, not in the toil itself, but be 
cause thereby they gain other objects ; those objects aside, and habitual labor 
would be habitual misery ; the hope of bettering one's condition is the natural, ap 
propriate lure to labor, makes it tolerable and pleasant ; but take away this lure 
quench hope, let the laborer be assured, that though he may work at the top of his 
strength, he cannot better his condition, that he is doomed for life, and his posterity 
through all time, to utter poverty, that no amount of toil can make him the owner 
even of his own hands ; in a word, force him to work without a single lure of hope, 
or without procuring thereby one cherished object of desire, and you pour into his 
cup misery to the brim. Habitual labor, extorted from such a man, would be the 
mere phrensied struggle of fear and despair — their joint product. li.e scripture 
saith, what, every man's experience confirms, " Fear hath torment," Vet tear is 
the only stimulus under which the slave works ; his labor is extorted from him by- 
appeals to his sense of pain, either by actual infliction, or by the certainty of it, if 
he refuse. During his whole life fear, fear is the motive that goads him to effort 
and "Fear hath torment." It is befitting that slaveholders should call those per- 
sons who direct the labor of their slaves, " drivers." Slaves contented and 
happy ! ! and yet driven their weary round from day to day while life lasts, stung 
to the quick by fear ; forced to be, to do,, to suffer, to go, to stay, to eat, to drink, 
to wear, to have, just what, and when, and as, and only as, another pleases, and 
yet, contented and happy ! ! ! * 

But we shall be told that the slaveholders, who know far better than we do, say 
that their slaves are contented and happy. Answer : this question so nearly con- 
cerns slaveholders, that they are of all men the most incompetent witnesses. 
Courts of law take no man's testimony in his own case, unless he insists on tes- 
tifying against himself; in that case his testimony is the most conclusive of all 
evidence. Slaveholders are under the strongest inducements to assert the con- 
tentment and happiness of their slaves ; consequently, whenever they, in the face 
Of all these inducements, deliberately and solemnly assert that the slaves are dis 



183$.] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 39 



contented and miserable, their testimony is entitled to the highest credit, for it is 
deliberately given against themselves, against their own benevolence, their justice, 
honor, and character, and calculated to excite against them the indignation of all 
just minds, for forcibly holding human beings in a condition, which, according to 
the voluntary testimony of the wrong-doers themselves, is full of misery. 

TESTIMONY OF SLAVEHOLDERS. 

Reader, look at the following testimoHy of slaveholders. They declare in the 
strongest language, that the slaves long for liberty, and that instead of hugging their 
chains, they writhe and toss in them. 

Abolitionists are charged with over-statements in describing the horrors of slavery, 
but when slaveholders voluntarily take the pencil, who will accuse them of high co 
loring in drawing the picture ? 

It is well known that in the winter of 1831-2, the Legislature of Virginia was 
engaged more than two weeks in discussing the question of slavery. We give 
few extracts from that debate. Mr. Moore said, " they {the slaves) will always be 
disposed to avail themselves of a favorable opportunity of asserting their natural 
rights.* * * * It may be safely assumed, that, wherever the slaves are as numerous 
as the whites, it will require one half of the effective force of the whites to keep their, 
quiet ; such is the fact as to the whole of Eastern Virginia." 

In another part of the same speech he said : " I lay it down as a maxim not to be 
disputed, that our slaves are now, and will ever be, actuated by the desire of liberty." 

Mr. McDowell. " Sir, you may place the slave where >ou please — you may op- 
press him as you please — you may dry up to your uttermost, the fountains of his 
feeling, the springs of his thought — and the idea that he was born to be free will survive 
it all. It is allied to his hope of immortality — it is the ethereal part of his nature 
which oppression cannot reach." 

Mr. Preston*. " My old friend from Halifax, (Mr. Bruce,) told us that the Vir 
ginia slave was happy and contented. Mr. Speaker, this is impossible ; happiness 

incompatible with slavery. The love of liberty is the ruling passion of man ; and 
he cannot be happy if deprived of it." 

Mr. Campbell. " The ever-abiding spark of liberty, silently, but surely exists 
in the bosom of even the most degraded, oppressed, and humble slave on earth." 

Mr. Gholson, in describing the attempts to keep the slaves from gaining their 
liberty, said : " And think you, Sir, that this attempt will not be resisted? — Just as 
sure as a love of freedom and the immediate prospect of attaining it will inflame 
the heart and inspire revolution — the love of freedom will be armed with desperation.''' 

Mr. Daniel. '• The slaves cannot long remain ignorant of thesentiments which 
are thus publicly expressed, and it would indeed be strange if they did not greedily 
adopt expressions so favorable to their cause." 

The preceding extracts are from speeches made in the legislature of Virginia on 
the 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, and 26 of Jan. 1832, as reported in the Richmond Whig. 

The late Judge Tucker of Va., professor of law in the University of William 
and Mary, published a letter to a member of the Va. Legislature in 1801, in whichl 
he says : — " The love of freedom, sir, is an inborn sentiment. At the first favora- 
ble moment it. springs forth and defies all check. Whenever we are involved in 
war, if our enemies hold out the lure of FREEDOM, they will have, in EVERY 
NEGRO, a decided friend." 

Hon. B. W, Leigh, late Senator in Congress from Va., in a series of letters t ! 
the people of that state in 1832, speaking of the slaves, says : " The peculiar inter- 
est they must take in the subject we may be sure makes their hearing very acute. 
It is the most combsutible matter that takes fire the soonest." p. 77. 

Hon. P. P. Barbour of Va. now a judge of the U. S. Sup. Court, said in a 
speech in Congress in Feb. 1820, (see Nat. Iatell.-of that date,) " Slavery, disguise 
it as you will, is still a bitter draught." 

Governor Giles, in his address to the legislature of Virginia, 1827, speaking 
of the number of crimes punished by sale into slavery, says: " Slavery must be 
admitted to be a punishment of THE HIGHEST order ; and according to every 



40 Anti- Slavery Almanac. [1839 



just rule for the apportionment of punishment to crime, it would seem that it ought 
to be applied only to crimes of the highest order.'" [Men are punished to the ut 
most, by inflicting " happiness" upon them !] 

In 1787, every slaveholder in Congress voted for the following resolution : " There 
■ ihall be neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude in the territory north-west pf 
the Ohio, otherwise than for the punishment pf crimes." 

Henry Clay, at a meeting of the Am. Col. Soc, Jan. 1818, said : "He has 
placed a false estimate upon liberty, who believes that many [slaves] would refuse 
the boon even when coupled with such a condition."* [Banishment to Liberia.] 

Rev. J. D. Paxton of Virginia, who had always lived in the midst of slaves, 
and held them, says in his " Letters on Slavery," p. 153, " The slates, man, wo 

MAN AND CHILD, ARE LONGING FOR FREEDOM." 

Patrick Henry of Va. in his letter to Robert Pleasants, dated Jan. 18, 1778, 

ys : " Let us transmit to our descendants a pity for their (the slaves') unhappy 
lot." " Let us treat the unhappy victims with lenity." 

Jefferson, in his notes on Va., p. 71, says that the slave "entails his own mis 
erable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him." In his pub 
lished Correspondence he says : " When the measure of their tears is full — 
when their groans have involved heaven itself in darkness, doubtless a God of 
Justice will awaken to their distress." [Contentment and happiness ?] 

Washington, in his letter to Robert Morris, April 12, 1786, says : " I hope 
it will not be conceived that it is my wish to hold these unhappy people, in slavery." 

McCall, in his history of Georgia, says : " This class of people, (slaves,) who 
could not be supposed to be contented in slavery, and who would grasp with avidity 
at the most, desperate attempts that promised freedom," &c. 

In the Kentucky Convention of 1790, Mr. Rice called the slaves' condition a 

wretched situation," " a miserable state" — said that he was consigned to a " bot- 
tomless gulf of wretchedness," and added, "The laws confine him in misery." 

The Editor of the Maryville (Tenn.) Intelligencer in his paper of Oct. 1835 
speaking of slaves in the South-western states, says, " their condition is second 
only to that of the wretched creatures in hell." In a subsequent num 
ber the editor says : " We, of the South, are surrounded by a dangerous class of 
beings — who, if they could but once entertain the idea that immediate death would 
not be their portion, would re-act the St. Domingo tragedy. But a consciousness 
that a ten- fold force would gather from the four corners of the United States, and 
slaughter them, KEEPS THEM IN subjection. But to the non slave-holding states, 
we are indebted for a permanent safeguard against insurrection. Without their as- 
sistance, the white population of the Southern States would be too iveak to quiet 
that innate desire for liberty, which is ever ready to act itself out." 

The Minutes of the American Convention convened at Baltimore, Oct. 25, 1826. 
contain a communication from two delegates to that body from N. C, Messrs. M. 
& W. Swain, in which, speaking of the slaves in the eastern part of that state; 
they say, " Their situation is wretched beyond description." 

In the Convention that framed the Constitution of Va., in 1829, Mr. Campbell 
said : " In the year 1814, vhen all the militiaeastof the Blue Ridge, were chiefly 
employed in patrolling the counties on the sea-board, and generally east of the 
Ridge, to prevent insurrections among your own discontented population." 

Having given a little of the testimony of slaveholders in words, we now give the 
testimony of slaveholders by their actions. 

The whole system of slavery is constructed on the presumption that slaves are 
unwilling to be slaves. All its laws and regulations pre -suppose and assume that 
they must necessarily be discontented, and will constantly strive to escape. Hence 
the laws prohibiting their leaving the plantation without a pass, and authorizing 
any one to give twenty lashes to those who have none, laws against such as harbor 
runaways, and the penalty of death to be inflicted on any slave who aids another

to run away. Hence the nightly patrols and daily vigils — the citadels and guard 
houses, the ordinance in all southern cities, forbidding slaves to leave their masters' 
premises after a certain hour in the evening. The law of S. C. authorizing any 
person who finds more than seven slaves together in the highway without a white 
person, to give them each twenty lashes, also 39 lashes in Va., Ky., and Mo. for 
any slave carrying a club, — penalties for the crimes of reading and writing, — assem 
bling to worship God, unless a majority of white persons are present — also prohibit 
ing all evening meetings — also for " being found in another person's negro quar 
ters, 40 lashes," " for being on horseback without the written permission of his 
master, 25 lashes," " for keeping a dog, 25 lashes," "for taking away a boat or 
canoe from where it is made fast, for the first offence 35 lashes, and for the second 
shall have cut off from his head one ear." For all the preceding laws, see 2 Brev 
Dig. 231. Prince's Dig. 447. Rev. Code of Miss. 371. 2 Mo. Laws, 751. Del 
Laws, 104. Haywood's Manual, 78. Martin's Dig. 622. 
We give a specimen of another class of laws by a quotation. 
By the laws of Louisiana, " No man can emancipate his slave, unless the slave 
has attained the age of thirty years, except u slave who has saved the life of his mas- 
ter, or his master's wife, or one of his master's children ; such a one may be emanci- 
pated at any age." 

In a number of other slave states, emancipation is forbidden in all cases except 
for " meritorious services." Thus the Legislatures of slave states declare that 
the gift, of liberty is the greatest reward they can bestow upon a slave for services 
the most important to the state, and that it is the greatest motive they can hold out 
to prompt other slaves to like services. A few years since, a slave, at great haz- 
ard, saved the State House at Mil ledge ville, Ga., when in flames. The Legisla- 
ture purchased him of his master, and set him free, paying for him $1800. In 
1822, a slave gave information of a projected insurrection in Charleston, S. C. The] 
Legislature held out to other slaves the strongest possible motive to do likewise in! 
similar cases, by giving him his freedom. During the revolutionary war, the Legis-I 
lature of New York passed an act granting freedom to all slaves who should serve; 
in the army for three years, or until regularly discharged. See 2 Kent's Com. p. 255.J 
All these, and a multitude of other laws in slave states are based upon the ad- 
mitted fact that slaves are, and must inevitably be, discontented with their condi- 
tion, and constantly trying to get out of it ; they proclaim also, that all slaveholders 
know this, and therefore strive to the utmost to prevent it. The laws of slave 
states, their swarms of patrols, their guard-houses, citade's, alarm bells, vigilance 
committees, chain gangs, written passes, advertisements for runaways, trained 
blood hounds, fortified churches,* their whips, yokes, fetters, branding irons, &c. 
prove as clearly that the slaveholders know that their slaves are unwilling to be 
slaves, and will do their utmost to escape, as the handcuffs, bolts, bars, iron doors, 
and massive walls of our prisons prove that the government know that those who 
are sent to prison are unwilling to be prisoners, and will do their utmost to escape. 

RUNNING AWAY FROM CONTENTMENT. 

Men are apt to show by their actions what they like and dislike. If slaves are 
contented and happy in slavery why do they run away from it every chance they 
can get? When prisoners break jail we are apt to think they are not "contented: 
and happy" to stay there, and when they are all the while trying to break jail 
whether they get out or not, it would be an odd notion to interpret all these strug 
gles as so many capers of contentment and happiness. Why are the slaves con- 



In Charleston, S. C, a guard with fixed bayonets is stationed on the Sabbath before 
the door of every church, during the hours of service.

stantly running away ? Doubtless it is because ihey are so happy they don't know 
what to do with themselves, and so, in their glee, fall to kicking up their heels, as 
babies dance up and down, and shake their hands at the sight of sugar plums. 
But then their kicking up their heels being all in one direction, away from the 
plantation, rather than toward it, and the fact that when away, they stay away, and 
are always trying to get their friends away, — these are mysteries about which poor 
human reason is doomed to puzzle itself in vain ! When a horse happens to jump 
out of rich clover into a mullen field, he is sure to jump back again, but horse : 
instinct is no standard for human reason. A rational horse would have stayed in 
the mullen field contentedly munching the stems. 

We give a few extracts from the American State Papers, to show how slaves 
prefer slavery to freedom. 

The Va. and Md. claimants under the 1st art. of ths treaty of Ghent set forth tnat, 

" In July and August 1814, the enemy made several landings on the northern 
neck of Virginia. On a sudden an order came, that all the troops should be 
marched to the defence of Washington, and this neck, of 18 miles wide, was emptied 
of all its efficient forces for nearly six weeks. During the absence of the forcesj 
there was nothing to restrain our slaves, and they flocked in hundreds to the enemy." 
See their memorial.— St. Pap. 2 Sess., 20th Cong. v. 5, No. 190. p. 4. 

Extracts from the instructions of Mr. Clay, when Secretary of State, to Mr. 
Gallatin, Ministei to Great Britain, dated June 19, 1826. 

" You are instructed to propose a stipulation for a mutual surrender of all per- 
sons held to service or labor under the laws of one party, who escape into the ter- 
ritories of the other. Our object in this stipulation is to provide for a growing evil. 
Persons of the above description escape principally from Virginia and Kentucky 
into Upper Canada. In proportion as they are successfid in their retreat to Canada, 
will the number of fugitives increase. The motive for getting them back is the desire 
which is generally felt to prevent the example of the fugitives becoming contagious. 

" The states of Virginia and Kentucky, are particularly anxious on this'subject. 
The General Assembly of the latter has repeatedly invoked the interposition of the 
U. S. Government with Great Britain. You will therefore press the matter." 

Mr. Barbour to Mr. Clay. " I endeavored to impress on him, (the British Min- 
ister,) the importance of the subject — stating that the mischief was by no means 
confined to the number that escaped, but acted on, and much impaired the value of 
those who remained, — the successful attempts at elopement being a strong allure- 
ment with all to abscond." — St. Pap. 2 Sess. 20th Cong. vol. 1. No. 19. 

a " refuge" from happiness. 

" Dec. 18, 1826. Mr. Brent (of La.) offered the following. 

" Resolved, That the president of the United States be requested to inform this 
House whether any measures have been taken to obtain the runaway negro slaves 
from Louisiana and elsewhere, which have talten refuge in the territories of Mex- 
ico."— Journal H. R. for 1826-7, p. 70. 

A MUD FORT IN THE WOODS VS. PLANTATION " HAPPINESS." 

In 1816 the U. S. Gov't instructed General Jackson to inform the governor of 
Pensacola that some hundreds of fugitive slaves from the U. S. were occupying a 
fort in his territory, and that they furnished an asylum to other fugitive slaves from 
the neighboring states, &c. April 8, 1816. Gen. Jackson ordered Gen. Gaines 
into Florida to destroy the fort, alleging as a reason that it afforded a refuge to 
runawav slaves from the United States. 

In a letter from Commodore Patterson to the Secretary ©f the Navy, August 15 
1816, speaking of the destruction of this fort, he says : 

" The service rendered by the destruction of this fort, and the band of negroes 
who- held it, is of great and manifest importance to those states bordering on the 
Creek nation, as it had become the general rendezvous of runaway slaves, — an 
asylum where they were assured of being received. This hold being destroyed,

they have no longer a place to go to, and will not be so lial>le to abscond." Further 
on he says : " The forces were daily increasing, and they felt themselves so strong 
and secure that they had commenced several plantations on the fertile banks of the 
Apalachicola, which would have yielded them every article of sustenance, [can 
slaves take care of themselves ?] and which would consequently in a short time 
have rendered their establishment quite formidable, and highly injurious to the 
neighboring states."--S*. Pap. 2 Sess. 15th Cong. v. 6. No. 119. p. 12. 

The despatches to the Secretary of War assert that there were in the fort, 300 
negroes, men, women and children, and 20 Indians ! 

THE FASCINATIONS OF AN " ALMOST IMPENETRABLE" SWAMP. 

In 1837, the New Orleans Picayune, reporting the capture of a leader of fugi- 
tives called Squire the " Brigand of the swamp," says : " While they can support 
a gang and have a camp, we may expect our negroes to run away." In the 
same article he says the place whose delights had kept " Squire" " a long time 
from the happiness of slavery, and to which the " happy" slaves would of course 
escape, was a " marsh almost impenetrable to our citizens." 
"happy" slaves sowing their wild oats. 

During our two wars with Great Britain, a multitude of slaves fled from their 
masters and joined the British forces. To furnish the reader some data for judgin 
of the number that escaped during the revolutionary war, we insert the following 
extract from Ramsay's History. " When the British evacuated Charleston, S. C. 
in 1782, Governor Matthews demanded tlie restoration of some thousands of ne 
groes whtf were within their lines. ****** These, however, were but i 
small part of the whole taken away at the evacuation, but that number is very in 
considerable when compared with the thousands that were lost from the first to the 
last of the war. It has been computed by good judges that between the years 1775 
and 1783, the State of South Carolina lost twenty-five thousand negroes." 
[At least a fifth part of all the slaves in the state at the beginning of the war. See 
page 30.]— Ramsay's Hist. S. C. v. 1. p. 473-4. 

Dr. Ramsay being a native and resident of Charleston, S. C. enjoyed every fa 
cility for ascertaining the facts in the case ; but his testimony does not stand alone 
Col. Lee of Va. in his " Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department," v. 2. 
p. 45G, says, of "the negroes seduced and taken from the inhabitants of S. C.,"j 

" It is asserted upon the authority of the best informed citizens of S. C. that morel 
than twenty thousand slaves were lost to the stale in consequence of the war."j 

Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, after escaping from Williamsburg in 1775,1 
to a vessel in James river, offered liberty to those slaves who would join him. It 
appears from the history that one hundred of them are soon after enumerated among 
his forces. How many more joined him does not appear. — Burke's Va., v. 3. p. 431 

Extract of a letter from Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State, to Mr. Ham 
mond, Minister of Great Britain, dated Philadelphia, Dec. 15. 1791. "On with- 
drawing the troops from New York, a large embarkation of negroes, the property of 
the inhabitants of the U. S. took place. * * * A. very great number was carried off 
in private vessels, without admitting the inspection of the American Commission 
ers." — See "Political Correspondence," Papers relative to Great Britain, p. 4 

The following may enable the reader to form some judgment of the number that 
escaped during the last war 

Extract from the Report of the Com. of Ways and Means, to the House of 
Representatives, Jan. 5. 1819. "At the conclusion of the war in 1815, ft being

FREAKS OF "CONTENTMENT" IN 1732. 

"There were at the Natchez on the plantations a considerable number of ne 
groes, nearly all of whom had joined the murderers of their masters in order to gam 
their freedom, and had followed their new friends among the Chickasaws. This 
circumstance, and their consequent emancipation, were known to their former 
companions, and suggested the possibility of their own release from bondage. They 
became restless and indocile." — Martin's History of La., v. 1. p. 294. date, 1732, 
SLAVES OPPRESSED BY "HAPPINESS," FIND " PROTECTION !" 

" This property has heretofore been of little value near the Ohio river, because 
runaways receive aid and protection from the people in the new territories and 
states."— Speech of Mr. Doddridge in the 7a. Con. Oct. 28. 1829, Deb. p 

Dec. 17. 1821. " Mr. "Wright of Md. laid before the house an attested copy of a 
resolution, passed Feb. 16, 1821, by the General Assembly of the state, complain

abscond and go into that state," and calling for an act of Congress to prevent the 
continuance of the evils complained of. They say that " the present state of 
things, [protection given to the " happy" fugitives,] is not only vexatious to the 
master, but extremely pernicious, and calculated to destroy the contentment 
and happiness of slaves." — Am. St. Pap. Class 10. vol. 2. No. 506, p. 752.

" Their vicinity to nonrslave-holding states, must forever render this sort of

Canal) passes to Pennsylvania, slaves cannot be held there." — Speech of Mr. Scott 
in the Va. Convention, 1829, Deb. p. 126. 

"contentment" of judge Washington's slaves. 

Hon. Bushrod Washington, nephew of Gen. Washington, and Judge of the Sup. 
Court of the U. S., sold 54 of his slaves, to be taken to Louisiana, in August 1831 
while he was Pres. of the Am. Colonization Society. In a letter published in the 
Bait. Telegraph, Sept. 18, 1831, he says : " I called the slaves together, and assured 
them I had no intention to give freedom to any of them. That the disappointment 
caused by this declaration should lead to the consequences which followed ivas 
to be. expected. * * * * I had good reason for anticipating the escape of ALL THE LA 
BORING MEN cf any value to the Northern States as soon as I should leave home." 
SLAVES KNOW WHEN TO SEEM MOST " CONTENTED." 

But perhaps we shall be told that the slaves say that they do not wish to be free 
True — and the more they wish to be free, and are laying plans for it, the more they 
ill profess to be contented and happy, lest they should be more closely watched. 
That is human nature. When the conrict who has been trying to break jail all 
night, hears the turnkey coming, he crowds on his handcuffs, slips in the sawed 
bars, and begins to snore, or, if in the day time, shows his contentment by striking 
up a tune. Slaves are not such fools as to exhibit discontent and a longing for 
liberty, either to their master or to his guests. 

TESTIMONY OF JAMES BRADLEY AN EMANCIPATED SLAVE. 

He bought his freedom in 1832, when nearly 30 years old. In an account of his 
life in the " Oasis." speaking on this point, he says : " I do not believe there ever 



was a slave who did not long for liberty. 



I was never acquainted with 



slave, however well he was treated, wh© did not long to be free. There is one 
thing about this, that pecple in the free states do not understand. When they ask 
laves whether they wish for their liberty, they answer ' No ;' and very likely 
they would say they would not leave their masters for the world. But, at ihe 
same time, they desire liberty mere than any thing else. The truth is, if a slave 
shows any discontent, he is sure to be treated worse, and worked the harder for it ; 
and every slave knows this. When they are alone, all their talk is about liberty — 
liberty ! It is the great thought and feeling that fills the mind full all the time." 

And yet it should be remembered that this liberty, the thought of which " fills 
{the mind full all the time," does not deserve the name. The freedom which 
emancipated slaves enjoy at the South, is only another name for oppression. 



1839.] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 45 



True, it is vastly more tolerable than slavery, but still it is leaded with grievous 
privations, and liabilities to outrage without redress. Some slaves there may pos- 
sibly be, slaves of very mild masters, hardly held practically as slaves at all, who 
might hesitate to exchange their situation for that fettered, unprotected, persecuted 
freedom, which is all that the iron code of the slave states metes out to the frer 
colored man. But even such cases, if any there be, are very rare exceptions 
Listen to a slaveholder on this point. Mr. McDowell, in his speech in the Va 
House of Delegates, Jan. 23, 1832, (see Richmond Whig,) says : " As to the idea, 
that the slaves in any considerable number of cases, can be indifferent to freedom, 
it is wholly unnatural. The truth is, sir, that although there are special cases of 
slaves who are willing to forego the benefits ©f complete freedom for certain other 
benefits which they enjoy under ^.nominal slavery, yet the cases, from their very 
nature, must be limited — they can extend only to a favored few." 

But we are told further that slaves show by their actions that they are happy — 
they sing, laugh, dance, and make merry. He is a shallow smatterer in human na 
ture, who does not understand this, that mirth is often rather the effort of the mind 
to throw off" trouble, than the evidence of happiness. It shows that a man wishes 
to be happy, and is trying for it, and is oftener the means used to get it than the 
proof that it exists. And as to singing — why do prisoners sing in jails 1 We have 
all heard them. Does it prove solitary cells a paradise? Do jail walls, dingy 
light and solitude make men so happy that they sing for joy ? They sing to make 
pleasure for themselves, not, to give vent to it. Their singing indicates a mind 
seeking amusement rather than one content with what it has — a mind conscious of a 
want, and striving to satisfy it, rather than one rejoicing in a full supply. In illus- 
tration of this we insert a fact stated by the Rev. Dr. Channing of Boston in his 
ate work on slavery, first edition, p. 101. 

"I once passed a colored woman at work on a plantation, who was singing ap- 
parently u-ith animation, and whose general manners would have led me to set her 
down as the happiest of the gang. I said to her, ' Your work seems pleasant toj 
you.' She replied, 'No, Massa.' Supposing that she referred to something par- 
ticularly disagreeable in her immediate occupation, I said to her, ' Tell me ihen 
what part of your work is most pleasant.' She answered with much emphasis, 
No part pleasant. We FORCED to do it.'" 

The celebrated Dr. Rush of Philadelphia, in one of his published medical pa 
pers, entitled " An account of the diseases peculiar to the negroes in the West In 
lies, and which are produced by their slavery," says : 

"We are told by their masters that they are the happiest people in the world, be-j 
cause they are 'merry.' Mirth and a heavy heart, I believe, often m^et together, 
and hence the propriety of Solomon's observation, 'In the midst of laughter the 
heart is sad.' Instead of considering the songs and dances as marks of their 
happiness, I have long considered them as physical symptoms of melancholy, and as 
certain proofs of their misery." — Am. Museum, vol. 4. p. 81. 

Finally, if slaves were contented and happy, that fact alone should be the ever- 
asting condemnation of slaver)', and hunt the monster from human society with 
curses on its head. What ! does it so paralyze the soul, subvert its instincts, blot 
out its reason, crush its upward tendings, and murder its higher nature, that a man 
can be " contented and happy," though robbed of his body, mind, free choice, lib- 
erty, time, earnings, and all his rights, and while his life, limbs, health, conscience, 
food, raiment, sleep, wife and children, have no protection, but are subject every 
moment to the whims and passion-gusts of an owner, a manstealer ? Nobly was 
it said by Burke, in reply to a vaunting slaveholder, who boasted that his slaves 
were "contented and happy:" "If you have made a contented slave, you havej 
made a DEGRADED MAN."

" WE SHALL BE OVERRUN WITH THEM." 

If ghosts were flesh and blood, and flew in flocks, the spectres of beggary and crime 
| 'conjured up by "We shall be overrun with them," would darken all our northern air. 

This objection, when urged against our measures, implies the conviction that they 
will be successful. When urged against emancipation it implies that slaves are kept 
where they are against their wills. It implies also that those who make it would 
keep the slaves in their chains rather than run the risk of having here and there a 
colored neighbor. If the objector were to see a slaveholder knocking off" the chains 
throwing away the whip, and giving wages to his laborers he must needs cry out : 
' Stop ! stop ! if you pay your laborers and treat them well, they will quit you and 
ush to the north." 

Who makes this outcry? An American, who, while he boasts that his coun- 
try is an asylum for the oppressed of all nations, would perpetuate the oppres 
sion and robbery of his own countrymen, lest some of them should find an asylum 
in his neighborhood. 

But this objection is a bald prophecy, based on no facts, and contradicted by his- 
tory, and by human nature. If slavery were abolished, the slaves would choose to 
stay at the south as hired laborers, rather than come to the north. Reasons : 

1. They are already there. And the trouble, expense, distance to be travelled 
time necessary for the journey, &c. would forever dissuade the main body from 
migration to the north. 

2. There is far more room for them in the slave-holding portions of the U. S. 
than in the non-slaveholding. In the former there is one-third more territory and 
one-third less population than in the latter. 

3. The climate of the south is congenial to them, that of the north -uncongenial. 

4. There is far less prejudice against the colored man there than at the north. 

5. They are remarkable for their local attachments. This is one of their peculi- 
arities everywhere — wherever they are to be found, their aversion to a change of 
'residence, especially to a distant removal, is proverbial. All travellers in Africa 
unite in this testimony. — Edwards' History of the West Indies — Walsh's Sketches 
of Brazil — Matheson's "Notices of Jamaica" — Dr. Dickson's " Mitigation of Sla 
very" — Sturge and Harvey's " West Indies in 1837 " — Thome and Kimball's " Si> 
months in Antigua, Barbadoes, and Jamaica" — abound with testimony to this, trait 

We insert from the latter work, a few testimonies of ex-slaveholders in An- 
tigua. "The negroes are not disposed to leave the estates on which they have 
lived, unless they are forced away by bad treatment." — H. Armstrong, Esq. 

"Nothing but bad treatment on the ptrl of the planters has ever caused the ne- 
groes to leave the estates on which they were accustomed to live." — S. Bourne, Esq. 

" The negroes are remarkably attached to their homes." — James Howell, Esq. 

"The negroes are peculiar for their attachment to their homes." — S. Barnard, Esq 

" Love of home is very remarkable in the negroes. It is apassion with them."— 
Dr. Darnell, Member of the Council. 

An aged planter said : " They have very strong local attachments. They love their 
little hut, and will endure almost any hardship before they will desert that spot." 

Messrs. Thome and Kimball say : " Such are the sentiments of West India 
planters ; expressed, in the majority of cases, spontaneously, and mostly in illus- 
tration of other statements. We did not hear a word that implied an opposite 
sentiment. One gentleman observed that it was a very common saying, with the 
negroes, — 'Me nebber leave my bomin 1 ground. 1 — i. e., birth-place." 

6. The slaves rarely run away from mild masters now. When they become their 
own masters and are protected by just laws, why should they leave their native re 
gion to roam among strangers in an uncongenial clime ? 

7. Slaves, when emancipated in the South, stay there, unless driven out. 





1839.] Anti- Slavery Almanac. 47 



There were in 1830, 44,000 more free colored people in the slave states than in 
the free states ; and this notwithstanding all the barbarous laws of the slave states 
made expressly to oppress and drive them out. From 1820 to 1830, the free col- 
ored population of the slave states increased 35.1 per cent, while the colored popu- 
lation of the free states increased only 19.1 per cent, but little more than half as 
fast, and this in spite of expulsion laws, and notwithstanding the removal by the 
Colonization Soc. of 1008 from the slave states and only 155 from the free states. 

The utter aversion of the slaves, when free, to migrate from the state, was as- 
serted by Gen. Broadnax, an advocate of colonization, in his speech in the Vir- 
ginia Legislature, in 1832, in favor of a bill for the forcible removal of free colored 
people. He said : " It is idle to talk about not resorting to FORCE.* * They 
must be COMPELLED to go.* * ALL OF US LOOK TO FORCE, OF 
SOME KIND." Another member, Mr. Fisher, said : " If we wait until the free 
negroes consent to leave the state, we shall wait till lime is no more." 

If they are reluctant to leave now, while slaveholding laws crush them to the dust, 
will they be more disposed to leave when slavery is abolished, and with it that bloody 
code against the free colored people which slavery made " nec-cssary ? " 

Further. When the slaves are emancipated, the present masters would choose 
to employ them as hired laborers in preference to any other class. 

1. They must have laborers. — They cannot dig, (the present generation at. least,) 
and to beg they are ashamed. The fact that these laborers are already on the ground 
would be to- the planters a strong motive tofrecpthem there rather than to get others 

2. They have always been accustomed to them. Many of the slaveholders in the 
West Indies, enraged at the passage of the Emancipation Act, and in hot haste to 
verify their own predictions of ruin, imported white laborers to supply the places 
of their emancipated slaves. But a brief experiment let off their zeal ; meanwhile 
the importation came to a stand, their wrath got cold enough to swallow ; and in- 

tead of paying a hundred per cent premium for the reputation of prophets, and after 
all having their labor and losing their cash for their pains, they turned their foreign 
laborers adrift and were glad to hire those to whom they had always been accustomed. 

3. The slaves are acquainted tvith all kinds of plantation labor — -the raising of the 
southern staples, preparation of the soil, getting in the crops, modes of cultivation 
curing for market, with the times and seasons of all, the causes affecting them, &c 
Any other class of laborers would have all these things to learn, and it would tak< 
some years fully to get the run of them. Thus, for a time at least, they would be 
much less profitable laborers than those who had been all th'- : r ! ; ves engaged in 
this !« ; nd of la'.cr. 

4 The slaves ar? 'died to the climate both by canstitution and by long residence, 
nab:;' -ting them to i*. Any other class of laborers would be obliged to go through 
a pro. ess of acc'.lr. ,;tion, generally long and severe, and in a multitude of instan 
ces fatal, especially in all the/ar south and south-west. What a rush is made to 
the north every summer by men of business in the far south who are not natives. 
They dare not encounter the sickly months. If to stay there would be hazardous 
to men whose business calls them little into the sun, and is not exhausting, men 
too, who are able to live without labor during the sickly season, how would it be 
with the poor northern, or foreign laborer, who, instead of being able to take a 
furlough during those months, would be obliged to bear double burdens ? for the press 
of labor there is in the sickly months. How long would he be able to bear up under 
the foggy mornings, burning noons, and dew-drenched nights ? 

5. The planters would prefer their present slaves as hired laborers, for the addition 
al reason that they could get them cheaper than any others. They have been accus-

toraed to such a manner of living, that they could support themselves at half the cost 
necessary for any other laborers. Instead of having a host of artificial wants and ap 
petites crying for a supply, (and crying the louder because the,y are artificial,) as 
would be the case with any other class of laborers — their allowance when slaves, of 
a peck of corn a week, with a bit of bacon at Christmas, has engendered no such 
clamorous brood : consequently, with their simpler habits and fewer wants, and 
smaller doctor's bills, they could and would work for lower wages. 

6. The slaveholders would employ their present slaves as hired laborers, if for 
no other reason, because they could get no others. Where could they get 2,000,000 
of laborers ? or 1,000,000? or even 100,000 ? Suppose slavery abolished to-day 
and an agent of some large plantation, a quondam overseer perchance, should spur 
up to the north, and bustle through our country towns, beating up for recruits 
among our young farmers to take the places of the late slaves as laborers. Who 
would put on the uniform, and wait marching orders for the south ? Who would 
abandon the north where labor is honorable, where working men constitute a ma 
jority of our legislators, and hire out where labor is disgraceful, and the farmer or 
mechanic who lives by his own work is spurned with contempt ? where a Senator 
in Congress could say, as did B. W. Leigh of Va. in the Convention of that state 
in 1829 : " Those who depend on their daily labor for their daily subsistence 
never do, never will, and never can enter into political affairs ?" Who of our free nor 
them or western young men, would take his stand in the place just vacated by the 
slave, and brook the disdainful airs and lordly domination, and supercilious scorn 
of those, who have been taught, from their infancy, to look, upon labor as a disgrace 
and the laborer as a handy tool to serve their convenience ? 

But even if our northern yeomanry could overcome their repugnance on this 
score, the objection on the score of climate would be insuperable. Besides, while 
best land that the sun ever shone upon, land made ready for the plough by the 
hand of nature, can be had at the west for a dollar and a quarter an acre, what 
youth from the free states would break away from the attraction of such a magnet 
for the sake of working in a Carolina rice swamp ancle deep in water, or swelter 
ing twelve hours.a day in an Alabama cotton field, or a Louisiana cane patch \ 
But enough — we only say in conclusion, that the abolition of slavery, so far from 
increasing the colored population of the north, would, in all probability, lessen it. 
We know personally not a few of our own colored citizens, who would of choice 
make the south their home if slavery, and the laws it has given birth to, were done 
awa y. — We shall not be suspected of saying this in order to appease, by a peace 
offering northern prejudice and pro-slavery. We say it because we believe it to 
be a fact, and therefore relevant to the case in hand. By way of a parting saluta- 
tion to " we shall be overrun with them," we say, that in meanness, prejudice, 
shrivelled selfishness, and calculating cruelty, this objection is not a whit behind 
the very pink of slaveholding chivalry. 

CONCLUSION. 

Deeming it important to demonstrate the falsity of these objections, we have, in 
spite of contraction and condensation, left no room for the swarms of their rela- 
tions, equally the reverse of the truth. What must be thought of the loud 
professions of opposition to slavery made by those who eagerly seize and circulate 
such absurd falsehoods for the sake of riveting the fetters of the slaves ? Let 
those who have tried to quiet a nation's uneasy conscience, to silence the plea for 
the perishing, to turn their hopes into despair by fastening anew the loosening 
chains, thus increasing the nation's guilt, and consequent danger of the " exter- 
minating thunder" feared by Jefferson— if they are convinced of their error— bring 
forth fruits meet for repentance, by redoubled diligence in spreading truth.
