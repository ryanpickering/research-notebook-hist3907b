ry dear Brother} 

in afew minutes, I leave this port for Liverpool, in the 
packet ship Hibemia; conse.]U9ntly I have scarcely to scrawl my name* 
The package sent by i,:r. Merwin was promptly delivered. I had considerable con- 
versation with Mr. Tappan, respecting you as an agent for the H.a. Anti 
Slavery society. His only doubts seemed to be whether you could arrange 
your business and whether your compensation could be secured as the funds 
of the Society were nearly exausted. I think he regards such on agency 
favorably. I wish you would correspond with Spaniel E» Sewell, 38a,., 
the Oorr. Sec. of the society, and state to him, confidentially but 
explicitly, your views and situation. 

The Lord be your strength and wisdom, the prayer of 

your unworthy brother, 

,/m. Lloyd garrison. 

The above letter is adressed to Rev. S.S.Jocslyn, Hew Haven, Ot. and bears red h 
hand stamp and 20 cancel*
