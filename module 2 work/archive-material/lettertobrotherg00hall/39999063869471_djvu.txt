New Haven, February 14,1833. 



Bro. Garrison: 

I have some good news to cosmiunicate, which I trust will glad- 
den your heart as it has [ .1 Since ray absence frotri this city 
the subjects of [ abolition and 3 colonization have \}^%v\ taken up in [ 

] of our students; and the [ ] made 

have issued in the entire [ 1 while our side has 

been strengthened [ ' ] rnaKing our strength in the [ 

} which was last term only 3,8 ! To which add C 1 

covering yesterday — total 9 [ Think of that for New Haven ! It would 
be interesting to you to knov; how this change has been effected. Principal- 
ly by ffieans of your "Thoughts," which were extensively circulated last terra 
by Bro. Joes lyn and myself, and partly by incessant preaching and conversation 
with individuals, in which Bro. Cleave land, formerly of Andover but now about 
to be settled here, has been quite active. 1 believe you are acquainted with 
him. He has plenty of [ 1 and no one, not even his bitterest enerny, 

can deny his [ 1 of "brains." 

One of the brethren [ 1 froffi 

Georgia/heretofore a slave holder [ ] slavery, now ardently 

devoted to the [ cause of ] abolition. He owns a slave and is taking meas- 
ures [ for his 1 eiiiancipation. Mr.Hadley has obtained,! understand, about 
40 subscribers for the Abolitionist here, and I have procured two more. They 
.are all iiiipatientiy waiting for the F'sbf uaryj No. ; send them soon. 

Last night we had the question, "Qught the Colonization Society

to be depended on as a means fof aboiisiiing slavery?" up for [ discussion ] 
in tiie debating society in trie theological dept. The room was [ 1 

students, several gentleffien from tne city.&c. ,&c. [ Bl on 

our side and two on trie other. I [ ] attended the meeting and 

defended the negative of the question on the following grounds: 1st, that the 
design of the Soc. was to [ ]. 2nd. Assuming that 

this was the design, the scheoie ?;a3 im-C 1. 3rd. It «ill be a 

useless expense and an injury to the country to deport so mucn valuable bone 
and muscle. 4th, Tnat even were it practicable it would be unjust. We 
have no right to do evil that good may dorne. Each of these propositions was 
clearly proved. Rev. L. Bacon then addressed the meeting for nearly an hour. 
His speech was elegant.rriouthy ,and a great throwing of dust, totally irrelevant 
to the question. Knowing that hs was present, and designing to close his 
mouth,! read from the first part [ of your 1 "Thoughts" an extract from his 
article in the Chr. Spec. , which [ he acknowledged ],but said that you had 
twisted it as ail his [ 1 pronounced the book utterly un- 

worthy of confidence. He did not atterript to answer [ ] 

Taylor president. The question is continued [ ] ^ro. 

Cleavsland will blow Bacon up "sky high." Bro. C Jocelyn goes 1 to New York 
to attend a meeting about Dennison's paper, the Emancipator . We are now all 
ready to form an efficient anti-slavery society nere. I have learned also 
that Mr. Cieaveland's brother, who holds the office of Prss. or V. Pres. in the 
N.Y.Young Men's Col.Soc. ,has been brought over to the faith and will resign 
his office. It [ will make ] a stir afiiongst them there. I shall not fin- 
ish till [ loieeting next week; but for fear 1 should for- 
get [ ] [fientioh what nuiLbers of the Libe rator I want [

account of the ann. tiieating and my t ^ anxiously for 

the Report. 2l3t. Last evening our debate was continusd. Bro. Gleaveland, 
Homes, Bro.Jocelyn and myself spoke on the [ 1 side, C. and J. 

with great power and effect. The Colonizationists brought out their big 
guns, with their negro thieving wadding and expediency for shot. They ex- 
pended all thsir ammunition, belied you and impeached your book, but all to 
no effect, for Kark the result: when the question was decided frodi the Chair, 
it was admitted that we ought not to depend on the Col. Soc. chiefly for the 
abolition of slavery. The vote of the Soc. was. for the Col. Soc. 18, and for 
our side lO.tvhich we may account a gam of 8 to us and as a loss of 10 to 
them. Besides, there were many heretofore Colonizationists who did not feel 
prepared to vote at ail, so much were they snaksn by the arguments brought up. 
In consultation it is thought not to be best for friend Buffura to cociie here 
until [ 1 of our Soc. We expect to nuiiioer about [ 

] of them men of influence. I forgot to u-ention that [ Arthur ? 1 
Tappan came up from New York and made a speech. He did very well, too, and 
had considerable influence.
