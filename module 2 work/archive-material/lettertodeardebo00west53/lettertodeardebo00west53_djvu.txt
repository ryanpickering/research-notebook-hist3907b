V^ tiie responsibilities they had assumed, and en- 
courage us AGAIN to summon them to unite with us 
for a still more strenuous effort in ,the slave's behalf. 

An appreciable impression has been made upon this 
community. Many among us, wiio have hitherto re- 
garded the subject of human freedom with indificr- 
en'!e, will venture to do so no longer. We trust that 
happier influences than we have yet known, may 
lighten our coming labojis. We ask for reinforce- 
ments, that we may be better enabled to contin- 
ue our conflict witii slavery, as well as to defend the 
territory we have gained from it. 

Strengthened by much profitable experience, by in- 
creased knowledge and resources, we hope to mak«, 
this year, a more valuable contribution than ever bo- 
fore, to the Treasury of the State Society. It would 
1)6 unnecessary to state here tlie objects of the Massa- 
chusetts Anti-Slavery Society, or to enter into any de- 
tail respecting its operations. With these, our 
friends are familiar. But as our appeal may 
reach individuals not so informed, we would say to 
sucii, tliat, having deliberately and earnestly bou-nd 
ourselves to the anti-slavery cause, toe, as much as 
any otht'rs should be indisposed to spend our strength 
for nought; and we have carefully sought for the 
best mode of advancing its interests. A long and in- 
timate acquaintance with the Massachusetts Anti-Sla- 
very Society, a knowledge of the strength of princi- 
ple, integrity of character', efficiency, zeal and disin- 
terestedness of its members, has assured us that in co- 
operating with them, wo sliall most efl^ectunlly pro- 
mote our object. The anti-slavery feeling in Boston 
is steadily increasing ; how long a time may elapse be- 
fore the cause so dear to ourselves shall be honored 
and advocated of ally we may not predict. We can 



with respect to the Fair, and communicate their de- 
termination to us. In towns where no society exists, 
or where having a name to live they are dead, let in- 
dividuals, who remain true to the cause, unite their 
efforts in this behalf. Permit us to say here, to any 
who, in view of our protracted struggle and unantici^ 
pated perplexities, may be preparing to abandon the 
cause — ' The numbers of the enslaved, their sufier- 
ings and despair, the crime and danger of the slave- 
holder, the guilt of his northern confederate, are no 
less than when they first awoke your conscience, and 
enlisted your sympathy. Remember the declaration 
of our Saviour, ' No man having put his hand to the 
plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of 
God.' 

In many places, one laborer bears alone the heat 
and burden of the day. To such we would say, be 
resolute and self-sustained. You do but stew, to be- 
alone. Within your call are true and faithful hearts, 
-'hearts glowing with a flame.
