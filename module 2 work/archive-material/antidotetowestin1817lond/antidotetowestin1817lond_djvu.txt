ANTIDOTE 



TO 



" West Indian Sketches, #•<?." 



The Editor of the West Indian 
Sketches is exceedingly indignant 
that we should " think proper to 
raise our harsh and feeble note" (as 
he terms it) in the exposure of the 
misrepresentations, which are so 
unremittingly circulated against the 
West Iudian Communities. He says 
we are *' perfectly welcome to con- 
tinue our polemical howls," and 
very elegantly observes, that " every 
animal has its cry." He wishes us 
to " make an oath, or a solemn de- 
claration in writing, signed in our 
name, that we do really, and bond 
Jide believe our own assertions — he 
will then," he says, " give up the 
point ;" and, " though he cannot pro- 
mise to believe us, or that any 
one else will," he very obligingly 
" promises never to accuse us 
again."— It would ill become us to 
make any reply to these, and other 
equally undignified tirades : — we 
know too well what is due to our- 
selves, and to the deep importance 
of the subject before us, to be led 
into any such intemperate expres- 
sions. It was natural, perhaps, that 
one, who was sensible of having 
compromised his character for im- 
partiality and candor, should at- 
tempt by violence to bear down all, 
who would represent the facts in 
their true light. It was natural that 
the editor should be chagrined and 
disappointed at our having exposed 
his disingenuous attempt to mislead 
the public, on the subject of our 
West India colonies: but we can 
assure him that we are as much 
above the possibility of being di- 
verted from the cause, in which we 
are engaged, as our character is 
beyond the reach of his invective. 



We have not taken up the subject 
without due consideration — nor 
shall we hastily relinquish it, al- 
though we may have to sustain all the 
violence and intemperate abuse of 
the Editor of the Sketches, and 
other writers who hold the st me 
doctrines. 

He affects to believe " that it 
scarcely possible for us to have read 
the Sketches with any care." — Whe- 
ther we have done so, or not, will 
best appear by the exposure we 
have made of the calumnies they 
contain. The preceding numbers 
of the Antidote stand on record, 
and will answer for themselves : we 
are quite content to leave it to the 
decision of the public, whether 
they do not prove the disingenuous 
means, by which he has endeavoured 
to calumniate the West India body. 

He says, our ** accusations 
against him may be reduced princi- 
pally to three: that he is perpe- 
tually charging on all the colonists, 
to the unjust and indiscriminate de- 
famation of their characters, all the 
atrocious crimes which have at any 
time been committed by the most 
inhuman individuals, whom we de- 
test equally with himself; and 
among the rest, all the tyranny and 
oppression, committed by the Dutch 
in Guiana, although the harshness 
of their treatment, and the com- 
parative humanity of the English, 
are matters of perfect notoriety ; — 
that he has imputed to the present 
generation the misdeeds of their 
predecessors twenty or thirty years 
ago, passing over the intermediate 
amelioration, which has taken place, 
— and that, still with the same un- 
fairness of intention, he has, by 



suppressing all the favorable cir- 
cumstances in Dr. Pinckard's nar- 
ration, completely reversed the im- 
pression of the state of British co- 
lonial slavery, which his history is 
calculated, (whether intended or not) 
to convey." 

The Editor is not quite correct in 
stating that the charges against him 
may be reduced principally to these 
three, which appear to refer only to 
Dr. Pinckard's work. He should 
have mentioned the proofs we ad- 
duced of his having suppressed very 
important passages, both in the 
House of Commons' papers, and in 
the printed trial of Arthur Hodge, 
frorn which he made such partial 
extracts, — nay " of his having sup- 
pressed those very passages, which 
directly and unequivocally substan- 
tiated the reverse of his propositions." 
He now keeps these facts out of 
view — he endeavours to explain 
away his former broad assertions, 
that " the whole community, and 
all the magistrates of Tortola, con- 
nived at Hodge's crimes ;— that the 
laws were violated, to screen him 
from punishment; — that his atroci- 
ties were publicly known, and still 
no one shunned his company, or 
disapproved of his conduct ; that it 
would have been perfectly, romantic 
and highly ridiculous for any one to 
have taken steps against him," &c. 
Now, when he finds bow complete 
his refutation has been, he would 
persuade us that he did not mean 
that even " a doubt of the temper of 
} he whites should be proposed 
without discrimination, ^ although, in 
a subsequent passage, he declares 
that the *' moral perceptions and 
feelings, which prevail in the West 
Indies, are different from those on 
this side of the Atlantic," forgetting, 
also, his former declaration, that he 
charges the resident West Indians ge- 
nerally "with favoring such criminals, 
merely because they are whites, and 
of the cast of masters, and with 
tolerating their crimes, because com- 
mitted on those, who are black, or 
of the cast of slaves." 



We have not forgotten all this— we 
have not forgotten that, in speaking of 
Mr. Higgins's cruelty to his slaves in 
Nevis, — he declares that " his con- 
duct seems only to have raised him 
to a higher elevation in the regards 
of the resident planters of Nevis ; 
while those, who endeavoured to 
bring him to punishment, became 
the objects of general distrust and 
obloquy." — Now with regard to 
this assertion of his — it may be well 
to enquire who it was that " en- 
deavoured to bring him to punish- 
ment, and thus became the objects 
of such general distrust and ob- 
loquy?" — Perhaps the reader will 
expect to hear that it was one or 
two individuals, standing up in the 
cause of humanity, against the 
whole community of planters, with 
whom, the Editor says, " it is an. 
established principle to unite as one 
man against the negroes:" — Or per- 
haps he will imagine that it was one 
of the " numerous correspondents in 
the West Indies, from whom the 
Directors of the African Institution 
have derived much important infor- 
mation.'' What then will be his 
surprise at reading in the Parliamen- 
tary papers, laid before the House 
of Commons in 1812, — that not 
only both Houses of the Legislature, 
but the Island in general were ani- 
mated with one common feeling of 
indignation and abhorrence at Mr. 
Huggins' conduct: — that, a few 
days after the cruel punishment, 
which he inflicted upon his slaves, 
a gentleman of the highest respec- 
tability mentioned the circum- 
stance in his place, in the house of 
assembly, praying the house to pro- 
ceed to an investigation of it, which 
they immediately did ; and came to 
the following resolutions: — 
Resolved — That it is the opinion of 
this house, that the conduct of 
Edward Huggins, Senr. Esq., 
on Tuesday, the 23rd of this 
month, in inflicting punish- 
ment on several of his negroes 
in the public market place of 
this town, was both cruel and 



illegal; and that particularly 
in two cases, where 242, and 
291 lashes were given, he was 
guilty of an act of barbarity, 
altogether unprecedented in 
this island. 
That this house do hold such con- 
duct in the utmost abhorrence 
and detestation, which senti- 
ments perfectly accord with the 
feelings of the community in 
general. 
That this house do pledge them- 
selves to promote the strictest 
investigation into this cruel 
proceeding, so disgraceful to 
humanity, so injurious to the 
fair character of the inhabi- 
tants, and so destructive to 
the best interests of the West 
India Colonies. 
That the above resolutions, with 
the evidence taken in support 
thereof be printed: that co- 
pies be transmitted to England, 
and circulated through all the 
islands. 
That a copy of the foregoing re- 
solutions, with the evidence 
taken in support thereof, be 
sent to the Council for their 
consideration. 
The subject, then, was referred to 
the President of the island and the 
Council ! — Surely these must have 
raised their voices in defence of the 
oppressor — in defence of a white — 
of one who was of the cast of mas- 
ters ! — surely the " West Indian 
Aristocracy" — all of them planters 
too — could not well, on this occa- 
sion, omit " an exemplification of 
their feelings towards the negro 
race," vVho, we are told, suffer u->- 
der an open and undisguisv^f op- 
pression. But strange to say, the 
President and the Council joined the 
House of Assembly, in their " en- 
deavours to bring Mr. Huggins to 
punishment" and sent a message to 
them, adopting their sentiments, and 
recommending that every legal mea- 
sure should be taken to bring the 
party to trial ! 



His Honor the Presides d Coun- 
cil to the Gentlemen the As- 
sembly. 

Gentlemen, 

This board has considered 
the resolutions of your hor e, and 
the evidence taken, respecting the 
conduct of Mr. Edward Ht:£gins, 
Senr. and adopt the sentiments of > 
your house, in respect to the a cts of 
cruelty, stated by such evidence to 
have been committed: and this 
board is of opinion, that every legal 
measure should be taken to bring 
the party to trial. But this board 
is also of opinion, that, as the paifty 
charged must be tried by another 
tribunal, the publication of any 
evidence, previous to such trial, 
should be avoided. 

By command, 
~ JOHN BURKE, Junr. 

Council Chamber, Clerk of Council. 

Jan. 31, 1810. 

Here then is the whole legislature 
of the island, the President, the 
Council, and the Assembly, uniting 
as one man — not against the negroes 
—but for their protection — not in 
support of the oppressor, but in 
vindicating the rights of the op- 
pressed. — This, however, is not all 
that appears on the parliamentary 
papers. — The Assembly of the is- 
land, not content with expressing 
their abhorrence at what had taken 
place, resolved to prosecute Mr. 
Huggins, at the public expense, de- 
claring it to be" the opinion of their 
house, that one or more of the 
crown lawyers should be retained 
to conduct the prosecution against 
Mr. Huggins the elder, agreeable 
to the resolutions, entered into on 
the 31st of January last; and- this 
house will make provision for th« 
payment thereof." In the pro- 
priety of which, the President and 
Council concurred. So that, not 
only is it untrue that " those, who 
endeavoured to bring Mr. Huggins to 
punishment, became the objects of 
general distrust and obloquy — " not 
only is it untrue that " the iudigna- 



6 



tion ej „ed in this country, and 
the marked reprobation of the 
PrinceRegent, appear to have clothed 
him with a kind of sanctity, as a 
martyr in the colonial cause!" — but 
within a few days after the act 
which he eommitted-the legislature, 
according with the feelings of the 
community in general, holding such 
conduct in the utmost abhorrence 
and detestation— determined to take 
every possible legal measure against 
him: — and that the expense should 
be paid out of the public purse ! — 
TSnese measures, which to every 
impartial observer, must be gra- 
tifying and satisfactory, met also 
the decided approbation of His 
Majesty ; and Lord Liverpool di- 
rected the governor of the Leeward 
Islands, to " signifyto the Council 
and Assembly, His Majesty's full 
approbation' of the sentiments 
expressed, and the conduct pur- 
sued by them." This letter the 
West Indian Sketches keep out of 
view^ — they extract particular pas- 
sages from Lord Liverpool's corres- 
pondence, and entirely suppress 
others, which are materially impor- 
tant to a fair and candid statement 
©f facts. Why should not the 
Editor ingenuously give us Lord 
Liverpool's letter of the 2©th of 
September, 1810, which is in the 
very page preceding his other ex- 
tracts ] — Need we ask ? — if the mo- 
tive is not sufficiently obvious — the 
letter itself will explain that it was 
suppressed, because it directly re- 
futes so many of the Editor's asser- 
tions. — It is addressed to Governor 
Elliot, and is as follows : - 

Downing Street, Sep.,20, 1810. 

Sir, 

It has been represented to 
me, that a case has recently oc- 
curred within your government, in 
open defiance of the law, of such 
extreme oppression and cruelty, 
exercised by an opulent planter in 
the island of Nevis, named Huggini, 
towards a number of his slaves, 
as to have called for investigation by 



the Council and Assembly of the Island, 
which, after a formal enquiry of the 
case, instituted proceedings against 
the offender, and publicly reprobated 
his conduct with the strongest expres- 
sions of indignation and abhorrence. 
I have, in consequence, received 
His Majesty's commands to desire 
that you will lose no time in calling 
upon the proper officers for authen- 
tic copies of the minutes of the 
Council and Assembly of Nevis, upon 
the above case, as also for an au- 
thentic report of any judicial pro- 
ceedings, which may have ensued, 
or of any records or documents, 
which tend to throw light upon this 
transaction, or to bring to justice 
and to punishment any of the parties 
who were implicated therein ; or to 
afford proof against any magistrates 
or other officers, who may have been 
so criminally negligent of their public 
duties, as to have witnessed or for- 
borne to interfere, as has been as- 
serted, in order to prevent so dis- 
graceful a scene. 

In any communication you may 
make to the Council and Assembly of 
Nevis, upon this subject, I am com- 
manded to desire that you will sig- 
nify His Majesty's full approbation 
of the sentiments expressed, and the 
conduct pursued by them, on the 
above mentioned occasion, and his 
firm conviction that they will give 
every aid and support to the mea- 
sures, which His Majesty may judge 
proper further to order, when the 
information hereby called for, shall 
be brought under consideration. 
I am, &c. 

LIVERPOOL. 
JSk faoiernor Elliot, fyc 8fc 

LWthe reader consider all these 
circumstances, and then say whe- 
ther the West Indian Sketches have 
told the TRUTH in declaring that 
" Mr. Huggins rises in fresh dignity, 
after his disgraceful acquittal, as 
one who had suffered persecution 
in the sacred cause of white supre- 
macy. " Let him refer to the par- 
liamentary papers and other docu- 



rnents, which we adduced in our 
fourth number, proving that, in the 
case of Arthur Hodge, the magis- 
trates of Tortola were indefatigable 
in bringing the prisoner to trial, — 
that the two Houses of Legislature, 
the President, the Council, and the 
Assembly, made unexampled exer- 
tions to secure his punishment — 
that when he was condemned to 
death, the inhabitants took active 
measures, in concert with the go- 
vernor of the Leeward Islands, to 
see that the execution of the law 
was duly enforced : — let the reader 
refer to these documents, and then 
say whether the Editor's assertion 
that " the white mob is uniformly 
on the side of the oppressor" is not 
a calumny on the West India body. 
Let him refer to all or any of our 
preceding numbers,- — compare them 
with the West Indian Sketches, and 
then say whether the Editor has not 
unfairly perverted the whole tenor 
of the facts, to which he refers. 

We have every reason to believe 
that these Sketches are published 
under the sanction of the African 
Institution ; they are only a part of 
that dangerous system, which be- 
gins at length to meet with the de- 
served reprobation of all good 
men : — which, being founded in pre- 
judice, and a mistaken hope of po- 
pularity, is supported by very un- 
worthy and disingenuous means. 
These Sketches are not the only 
medium, through which the Direc- 
tors of the African Institution ven- 
ture to calumniate the West India 
Colonies : — we are sorry to say they 
pursue this course in a variety of 
other publications, at a great ex- 
pense to the funds of the society, 
which were raised Umongst the sub- 
scribers for very different objects. 
In a tone of dictatorial authority, 
and with an air of assumed conse- 
quence, which very ill become 
them, — and which, we think, will 
now, (after what has come to light 
respecting their own mismanage- 
ment in Africa and Berbice) sit less 
well upon them than ever;— 



they endeavour to excite the British 
Parliament to interpose in the in- 
ternal legislation of the colonies, — as 
a stepping stone to the great object of 
all their hopes, — the emancipa- 
tion of the slaves. The Editor 
of the West Indian Sketches declares, 
that " the Parliament and people of 
England are bound to take measures 
for raising our fellow subjects of the 
West Indies from their present state 
of degradation and suffering." — 
Again he asks " and is it to the un- 
controuled power of persons, capa- 
ble of such atrocities,* that the Bri- 
tish Parliament and nation will be 
eontent to leave the destinies of so 
many of their fellow subjects'?" 
These sentiments fully accord with 
the public reports of the African 
Institution, in which the Directors 
do not hesitate to declare that they 
wish to establish an interference, on 
the part of the British Parliament, 
in the internal affairs of the colo- 
nies: — an interference, which has 
been virtually guarded against by 
repeated Charters and Acts of Par- 
liament ; which has been deprecated 
by the greatest statesmen, who have 
ever shone in this country, and the 
danger of which has been proved 
by the Insurrection in St. Domingo, 
and the total loss to France of that 
valuable colony. 

The Directors would, indeed, 
persuade us that Charters and Acts 
of Parliament are vain and nugatory ; 
they would have us regard the 
opinion of eminent men as light in the 
balanced when placed against their 
own : — and as to the experience of 
times pastl^-it is to them as a tale 
that is told, which, in this day of 
religious zeal, is irrelevant and for- 
gotten. Fortunately, however, all 
these authorities are qn record ; — ■ 
and here the colonies might rest the 
whole question : — here they might 

* These " atrocities" of which he 
speaks, were perpetrated twenty years 
ago in a foreign colony ; — but, with hia 
usual candor, he applies them to the 
English planters of the present day,— 49 
we have shewn in our first, third, and 
fifth numbers.

make their first and only stand, — 
entrenched within the bulwark of 
their rights and privileges. — But we 
will descend from this our vantage 
ground, and walk down to meet the 
arguments of our opponents in the 
open plain, contenting ourselves, for 
the present, with proving — first, that 
no necessity exists for the interfe- 
rence of the mother country ; and— 
second, that it would not be justi- 
fied by prudence or policy. 

We believe it is generally ad- 
mitted, that the representations, 
which were made, during the abo- 
lition controversy, of the condition 
of the slaves in the West Indies, 
were very unjustly exaggerated — It 
is true that, prior to the year 1784, 
the laws, which prevailed in the 
colonies, were very imperfect : and 
the negroes certainly were not so 
well protected from oppression as 
they now are. Several instances of 
individual cruelty, in particular is- 
lands, might have been, and were 
brought forward — It would be un- 
reasonable, and argue a very im- 
perfect knowledge of mankind, to 
suppose that, amidst the extensive 
population of our West Indian set- 
tlements, persons might not be 
found, as in all other societies, 
whose bad passions had led them to 
acts of violence and oppression. 
Such persons, however, were held 
in dishonor by the great body of re- 
sident planters, and although the le- 
gislative enactments were too often 
inadequate to the due punishment of 
offenders — yet the laws of morality 
and benevolence generally secured 
to the slaves, a gentle and indulgent 
treatment. 

It was impossible that the many 
distinguished individuals, who took 
an active part in the abolition of the 
slave trade, could have any ac- 
quaintance with the society, that ex- 
isted in the West Indies ; they trust- 
ed, therefore, to the representations, 
which were made to them, by a few 
individuals, whose zeal carried them 
even beyond the bounds of proba- 
bility, — as was proved by the evi- 



dence of some of the most eminent 
characters in the country who de- 
clared that the planters in general 
were humane and merciful. 

We know — indeed the Editor of 
the West Indian Sketches tells us, 
that " the testimony of officers of 
high rank, admirals and generals, 
who have served in the West Indies, 
in favor of the mildness and huma- 
nity of the planters," makes no im- 
pression on the judgement of those, 
who declare their hostility to the 
colonies. We confess, however, 
that we should be at a loss to find 
any testimony more honorable — 
more satisfactory, or more likely to 
be unbiassed and free from preju- 
dice, than of such men as Lord 
Rodney, Sir Peter Parker, Admiral 
Barrington, Sir Joshua Rqwley, and 
Sir William Hotham. — We subjoin 
part of their evidence before the 
privy council in 1789, and leave it 
to others to decide whether such 
names are entitled to credit or not. 
Question put by the lords of 
the Privy council. 

" What have you observed of the 
behaviour of masters towards their 
negro slaves, in those islands, where 
you have commanded]" 

Answers. 
Lord Rodney — " I speak to all the* 
West India Islands, but parti- 
cularly to the island of Ja- 
maica ; and I am able to speak 
from experience, ever since the 
year 1761. I never saw any 
other than humane and proper 
behaviour to them. There is 
not any plantation without the 
attendance of a surgeon, most 
of whom come from England. 
I never saw any instance of 
cruelty, but, on the contrary, 
great forbearance. The punish- 
ments inflicted are not too se- 
vere ; and it is to be observed 
that by whipping a negro, his 
value is diminished, for if he 
bears the mark of having been 
flogged, the price of hito is 
sunk one half." 
Sir Peter Parker — " I commanded 



on the Jamaica station, between 
four and five jears during the 
last war, and I not only never 
saw, but never heard of any 
instance of cruelty exercised 
towards theui. At the houses 
where I visited, I observed that 
the negroes were treated with 
the greatest humanity and at- 
tention, and particularly when 
they was sick." 

Admiral Harrington — " I cannot 
speak with much relation to the 
Island of Jamaica, thirty-five 
years having elapsed since I 
was stationed there : during 
my service in the last war, I 
was chiefly at sea; but I was 
stationed at Barbadoes about 
three months, where I went on 
shore every morning, and most 
frequently visited the planta- 
tions that lay near the shore,, 
and I never saw any act of 
cruelty exercised upon the ne- 
groes." 

Sir Joshua Roivley — " I was sta- 
tioned at Jamaica between 
three and four years during the 
last war, and never saw any 
cruelty used towards the ne- 
groes during the whole of that 
time, but the negroes treated 
with the greatest attention." 

Admiral Hotham — " 1 have been 
three times in the West Indies, 
twice at the Windward Islands 
(residing there about five years 
in the whole,) and once in Ja- 
maica, where I remained about 
twelve months, and was fre- 
quently on shore at Jamaica. 
I never saw a single punish- 
ment inflicted. In the wind- 
ward Islands, I saw three in- 
stances of negroes punished by 
whipping, but not severely. I 
have seen punishments more 
severe inflicted on the soldiers 
and sailors." 
Question. 
*■ Did it appear to you, that more 

labor was required of the negroes 

than they could properly bear 1" 
Answers. 

Lord . Rodney — " They never ap- 



peared to me upon any planta- 
tion to be over-worked ; they 
do considerably less work than 
the laboring men in England. 
They work only with the hoe, 
and never make use of any 
heavy implement. They begin 
work just before sun rise, 
breakfast about eight, when I 
am told they are allowed one 
hour. At dinner they have 
generally two hours allowed 
them, from twelve o'clock till 
two; from thence they work 
till sun-set, which is about six 
in the afternoon." 
Sir Peter Parker and Sir Joshua 
Rowley — " We entirely agree 
with the above account given 
by Lord Rodney." 
Admiral Barrington — " The ne- 
groes are not over-worked in 
any respect. Compare their 
work with that of a sailor, be- 
longing to a merchant ship in 
loading and unloading, and the 
latter will be found to do as 
much work in a day, as the 
former in a week." 
Admiral Hotham — " I never ob- 
served that the negroes were 
over-worked in any respect." 
Question. 

" Do the negroes appear to be 
in a desponding state, or are they 
in general satisfied with their condi- 
tion r 

Answers. 
Lord Rodney — " So far from being 
in a desponding state, that I 
have often wished the ;poor in 
this country were in so happy a 
condition. The negroes have 
all the appearance of happi- 
ness and vivacity, and they ge- 
nerally dance in the evenings, 
after their work is ended."- 
Sir Peter Parker — " They appeared 
to me to be very happy and 
well satisfied with their situa- 
tion. They not only dance 
and sing in the evenings after 
their work is ended, but you 
may here them singing in the 
fields while at work. They 
enjoy themselves a great deal 



10 



i 



more than the white people in 
the West Indies." 
Admiral Harrington — w They have 
*"* appeared to me to be so happy 
at times when I have been very 
miserable myself, that I have 
very often wished myself in 
their situation." 
Sir Joshua Rowley — " They seem 
to me to be much happier than 
the poor people in this coun- 
try." 
Admiral Hotham — " I have always 
observed the negroes to be very 
cheerful, good humoured, and 
happy, especially when I have 
^conversed with them." 
The remainder of their evidence 
is of a similar nature, and we ven- 
ture to think it will, at least, be 
considered equally deserving of 
credit with that of Mr. Ramsay or 
Captain Smith, Mr. Nicholls, or 
Mr. Baggs, whose statements were 
of a very opposite nature i But let 
us admit, for a moment, that the 
assertions of these gentlemen are to 
be credited, — that Lord Rodney and 
other officers of high rank, knew no- 
thing of the matter, — that they really 
did not see what they thought they 
saw: — let us admit Mr. Ramsay's 
'very temperate and credible state- 
ment, that " ia his time almost the 
only instruments used in managing 
the slaves were the whip, bean 
stick, dungeon, and chains; that 
the master was actuated in his con- 
duct towards them by a constant 
suspicious jealousy, that was to be 
satisfied by no exertion — that was to 
be softened by no attachment : that 
he master conscious of making -his 
5 slave a mere instrument of profit, 
concluded that his slave must view 
him as his enemy and oppressor ; 
and therefore treated him as his 
enemy, and oppressed him ia re- 
venge — that the negro was not 
treated as an object of sympathy or 
deserving of regard. That every 
possible exertion was forced out of 
him,— that no exertion was rewarded 
—that he was worked, managed, and 
whipped as a brute— that he was 



suspected and hated as a rival, and 
treated as an enemy — in short, that 
he was a spunge, which was to be 
squeezed before he could be made 
to render his contents" — let us, for 
the sake of argument, admit that, 
between thirty and forty years since, 
these things were so — they would 
only further prove, — what is ascer- 
tained by all, who have made the 
colonial system an object of their 
impartial study, — that in all the is- 
lands the most important and satis- 
factory improvements have taken 
place in the condition of the slaves. 
This gratifying amelioration is not 
denied even by the Directors of the 
African Institution ; — although they 
would attribute it to other than the 
real motives, they admit the fact, 
which is quite sufficient for our ar- 
gument. Indeed our readers must 
remember that, throughout the 
whole ©f the discussions on the abo- 
lition of the slave trade, — one of 
the strongest inducements held out 
to parliament to consent to that 
great and good measure was, that it 
would tend gradually to ameliorate 
the condition of the negroes, by 
effecting such changes in the sys- 
tem of management, as the interest 
of the planter s % independent of their 
humanity, would naturally suggest. 
It was urged that the prohibition of 
a further supply would render those, 
already in the West Indies, more 
valuable to their masters : that it 
would become the direct and imme- 
diate interest of the planter to at- 
tend to their comfort and happiness, 
by increasing their quantity of food, 
by diminishing their hours of labor, 
and by every regulation, which 
might have the effect of encreasing 
their numbers. Not to multiply au- 
thorities upon this subject, we shall 
content ourselves with one or two 
extracts from Mr. Brougham's " Co- 
lonial Enquiry," published in 1803, 
and from Mr. Wilberforce's address 
to his constituents in 1807, as they 
forcibly illustrate the opinion they 
entertained of the natural and neces- 
sary consequence of the abolition of 



11 



the slave trade. Mr. Brougham 
says, " the abolition of the slave 
trade must, as we have already seen, 
greatly ameliorate the structure of 
society iu the West India colonies. 
Every man may now be left to pur- 
sue his own interest, in his own way. 
Few will continue so insane as to 
maltreat and work out their stock, 
when they can no longer fill up the 
blanks, occasioned by their cruelty, 
or their inhuman and short sighted 
policy. A great increase of wealth, 
and a rapid augmentation of the 
negro population will be the conse- 
quence of this milder system; for 
every proprietor of slaves will attend 
to the breeding, as the only method, 
by which his stock can be recruited, 
or his cultivation extended." 

Mr. Wilberforce expresses himself 
as follows : — " But all further im- 
portations being at length stopped, 
the slave market now no longer 
holding forth any resource, the ne- 
cessity for keeping up the stock 
would at once become palatable and 
urgent. All ideas of supply from 
without being utterly cut off, it 
would immediately become the 
grand, constant, and incessant con- 
cern of every prudent man, both 
proprietor, and manager, to attend* 
in the first instance to the preserva- 
tion and increase of his negroes, 
&c." " The operative principle, 
thus supplied, would exactly answer 
the desired purpose. It would adapt 
itself to every variety of situation 
and circumstances; it would pene- 
trate into the interior of every plan- 
tation ! it would insure a due quan- 
tity of food, it would provide 
against too rigorous an exaction of 
labor, and enforce the adoption of 
those reforms, which should be 
found requisite for encreasing the 
population. Many of the improve- 
ments, which must at once be intro- 
duced, are perfectly manifest ; but 
ingenuity once set at work in thi3 
direction, a thousand discoveries 
will be made, a thousand reforms 
adopted, and a manager's credit and 
character now depending on the 



increase of the negroes, not, as hi- 
therto, on that of the immediate and 
clear returns from the estate, the 
former would henceforth become the 
great object of his study in the clo- 
set, and of his conduct in life and 
action." Yes, the ameliorating laws, 
which have been passed in all the 
islands since the year 1784, the abo- 
lition of the slave trade, and above 
all, that progress in civilization, 
which warms into life the gentler 
virtues of humanity and benevo- 
lence, have shed their benign influ- 
ence on the colonial system, and in- 
troduced new regulations in favor of 
the negroes, which would before 
have been thought imcompatiblc 
with their situation. 

We shall not enter into a detail of 
the improvements that have been 
made. We must refer our readers 
to the late Report of the committee 
of the Mouse of Assembly in Ja- 
maica, as it affords so convincing a 
proof that the planters are actively 
employed in extending the laws for 
the better protection of their slaves. 

We have no doubt the other is- 
lands will follow the bright example 
of Jamaica. We fed confident they 
will gladly adopt any laws, con- 
sistent with their own safety, which 
may secure to the negroes every pos- 
sible degree of comfort and protec- 
tion. We do not hesitate to say, 
that much yet remains to be done in 
many of the colonies — and we know 
that the local legislatures, and the 
proprietors resident in this country, 
have no wish nearer their hearts 
than to effect every amelioration, of 
which the condition of the negroes 
is susceptible. 

But they will not permit a few 
individuals, arrogating to themselves 
exclusive humanity, and taking every 
occasion to injure their character 
by the most vehement and coarse 
abuse, to dictate to them the line of 
policy which they are to adopt. — f 
They will not be forced into any 
measures, which they consider to be 
dangerous and destructive to their 
fortunes,because the Directors of the 



12 



African Society wish to establish 
their system of African freedom in 
the colonies. The West India body, 
indeed, are told " that they quite 
mistake their own case, and that 
others know much better than they 
do what is good for them." One thing 
they certainly know — they know the 
rights and justice of their case, and 
their importance in the State, to 
whose prosperity and wealth they so 
largely contribute; and they are not 
much disposed to resign their judge- 
ment to the abstract opinions of a 
small party, who (even if they had 
any practical acquaintance with the 
subject) — proclaim, on all occasions, 
their hostility to the colonies, and 
could not, therefore, be considered 
as impartial judges. 

We cannot forget the words of 
Mr. Burke in one of his speeches on 
conciliation with the American Colo- 
nies. " I do not," says he, " know 
the method of drawing up an in- 
dictment against a whole people. I 
cannot insult and ridicule the feel- 
ings of millions of my fellow crea- 
tures. I am not ripe to pass sen- 
tence on the gravest public bodies, 
entrusted with magistracies of great 
authority and dignity, and charged 
with the safety of their fellow citi- 
zens upon the very same title that I 
am. I really think that for wise 
men, this is not judicious; for sober 
men, not decent; for minds tinc- 
tured with humanity, not mild and 
merciful." 

The Directors of the African In- 
stitution would do well to temper 
their vehemence by some such feel- 
ings as these, before they venture to 
indulge in their abuse of the colo- 
nial legislatures. But it were vain 
to expect from them the candor and 
liberality of sentiment, which actu- 
ated that great statesman. They 
have embarked in a scheme, which 
to all enlightened politicians must at 
once appear fallacious, and imprac- 
ticable, replete with danger to the 
happiness of those, whom they would 
seem to make the objects of their 
solicitude, and to the best interests 



of the mother country. They are 
sensible that they must have opposed 
to them the judgement of all tem- 
perate men. They endeavour, there- 
fore, by repeated calumnies against 
those whom they would injure, to 
give a false coloring to this great 
and momentous question, and make 
their appeal to the feeHngs and the 
passions of the people of this coun- 
try, rather than trust to the un- 
biassed, deliberative wisdom of Par- 
liament. 

We have shewn, — and we hope 
satisfactorily shewn — that the most 
gratifying improvements have been 
effected in the system of the colonies ; 
and that the legislatures there are 
not only capable, but anxiously de- 
sirous to ameliorate the condition of 
the slaves. 

We know that any exertions they 
may make will not keep pace with 
the wishes of the African Institu- 
tion ; — we are aware that nothing 
short of emancipation, as they them- 
selves acknowledge, will satisfy 
them. This, however, is of little 
moment ; their opinions are not very 
likely to influence the question either 
one way or the other : their ardent 
zeal will not readily overturn the 
long established systems of society, 
or the principles of eminent states- 
men and politicians, who do not 
usually look to an immediate per- 
fection of any system, but are satis- 
fied to see the progress of natural 
causes, as the more certain and safe 
means of effecting their object. 

" If laws, like other human insti- 
tutions, be imperfect, there exists 
complete power and decided incli- 
nation in the local legislatures, to 
watch over them, and supply the 
best remedies, as the exigencies, 
calling for them, arise. This incli- 
nation has been clearly displayed by 
the present generation, and their Re- 
presentatives, met in General Assem- 
bly ; inasmuch as more has been done 
to soften the rigour, and extend the 
protection of the law, to diminish 
labor, improve the condition, andaug' 
meni the comforts of the slaves, during 



13 



the last thirty years, than had, been 
previously accomplished from the 
settlement of the colony, and conse- 
quently there never was less neces- 
sity for the interposition of Parlia- 
ment, on any principle of ut'Jity or 
expediency." 

We shall now proceed to enquire 
into the policy of interfering with 
the local authorities, in the enact- 
ment of laws for the colonies. We 
might safely rest this question on the 
proofs we have adduced that no ne- 
cessity exists for such interference ; 
for what statesman or enlightened 
politician would put at risk the im- 
mense interests connected with this 
subject, unless the necessity of a 
change were clearly made out] — 
The science of legislation is not a 
branch of experimental philosophy, 
and less than ever so, when the ex- 
periment is to be made on the life 
and property of the subject; when 
a large portion of the community is 
to be disfranchised of those rights 
and privileges, which they have en- 
joyed from time immemorial. 

But, independent of these conside- 
rations, there areothers, which render 
it highly impolitic, — nay, impossible 
for the British Parliament to enter 
into this new field of legislation. — 
Even if it had time and oppor- 
tunity to undertake the discussion 
of all the minute regulations of the 
colonies, upon what principles would 
it begin to new model a system, 
which, in its first and leading fea- 
ture — namely, that of security from 
internal revolution, — is of the most 
delicate nature, and the details of 
which require an intimate knowledge 
of a thousand local circumstances, 
that cannot come under its cogni- 
zance! — If upon abstract theory, 
and the hope of speculative melio- 
rations, it would not have occasion, 
to trouble itself long with the care 
of legislation: — the whole fabric 
would at once give way, and we 
should then, when it was too late, 
lament the folly and ignorance of 
the experiment. But if the colonies 
are to be governed, with reference 



to"* the local circumstances which 
daily arise, and according to the 
changes, which take place there, as 
in every society, and require imme- 
diate attention ; — then it would be 
the height of folly to attempt to le- 
gislate for countries on the other 
side of the Atlantic. 

This objection (as Burke expresses 
it) " is not merely moral — but deep 
laid in the natural constitution of 
things. Three thousand miles of 
ocean lie between you and them. No 
contrivance can prevent the effect of 
this distance in weakening govern- 
ment. Seas roll and months pass 
between the order and the execu- 
tion ; and the want of a single ex- 
planation of a single point is enough 
to defeat a whole system. You 
have, indeed, winged ministers of 
vengeance, who carry your bolts in 
their pounces to the remotest verge 
of the Sea. But there a power steps 
in, that limits the arrogance of rag- 
ing passions and furious elements, 
and says so far shalt thou go and no 
farther." Instead of that uniform 
and consistent policy, which can 
alone secure the peace of any so- 
ciety — and particularly of a society 
so constituted as that of the West 
Indies, — we should be perpetually 
passing laws only to revoke them, 
as totally inapplicable to the sup- 
posed case, or as inadequate to the 
evil which they were intended to re- 
medy. This is not a picture drawn 
from the imagination-- it is the rea- 
soning, which history and experience 
must suggest to all who reflect upon 
the subject; for, unfortunately, wt 
have had awful examples in modern 
times ofthe danger of this proceeding. 

The national assembly of France 
had in 1790 declared the right of 
the French colonies to pass laws for 
their local and internal government : 
but in the following year, excited 
by the arts and misrepresentations 
of the Abbe Gregorie, Brissot, La 
Fayette, and others of the Society 
of the Amis des Noirs, it came to 
the fatal resolution of attempting to 
regulate the affairs of St. Domingo 



14 



by a total change in the constitution 
of the island. Accordingly on the 
15th of May a decree was passed, 
admitting the mulattoes to an equa- 
lity with the white inhabitants in all 
then* rights and privileges. They 
soon, however, had cause to lament 
this fatal interference — which, de- 
stroying the usages that had pre- 
vailed from the earliest settlement 
of the colony, involved the inhabi- 
tants — both proprietors and slaves — 
in a succession of the most dreadful 
calamities. The Governor of the 
Island, on receiving the decree, wrote 
to the French ministers, expressing 
his fears that " it would prove the 
death warrant of many thousands of 
the inhabitants;" and the event 
Kjournfully verified his prediction. 

The mulattoes and negroes began 
to perceive that the white proprietors 
were of no authority — they were 
taught to wonder at the respect, 
which they had hitherto paid tkem : 
that force of opinion, which alone 
secured their subordination, being 
unsettled, they began immediately to 
feel their own power, and one of the 
most horrible and destructive revo- 
lutions that perhaps ever desolated 
any country in the world was the 
consequence. Then it was that all 
France exclaimed against the inter- 
ference of the government in the lo- 
cal administration of the colonies: — 
then it was that the commercial and 
^Manufacturing interests foresaw the 
ruin of their trade and shipping,— 
and the country began to perceive 
that all her citizens were more or 
less interested in the prosperity of 
those valuable establishments, which 
they were on the point of losing. — 
The national assembly endeavoured 
to repair their error, and voted on 
the 24th of September, by a large 
majority, the repeal of the obnoxious 
decree, which, but a few months be- 
fore, had been carried by acclama- 
tion. But alas it was too late ! the 
mischief was done — the torch of re- 
volution was lighted, and no influ- 
ence of the Mother Country could 
extinguish it What influence, indeed. 



could she have? She had herself 
encouraged the blacks in their ex- 
pectations of freedom — and her re- 
vocation of the laws, which she had 
made in their favour, at once de- 
stroyed their confidence, and taught 
them to think that they must forcibly 
obtain the rights, to which she had 
herself pointed out the path. It 
was in vain that France poured in 
her troops to the support of the 
white inhabitants — the strength and 
numbers of the revolted negroes were 
irresistable, and after various mas- 
sacres and scenes of bloodshed, the 
colony was irrevocably lost to 
France. 

Such, too, were the sentiments, 
excited last year amongst the negroes 
in our cwn islands by the fatal at- 
tempt to introduce the Registry Bill : 
— great pains had been taken to 
make them believe that they were 
an oppressed race, whose condition 
was unnatural and unjust; — and 
that the King and the Parliament, 
at home, were about to pass some 
laws in their favor: — these they con- 
strued into an intention to make 
them free — and thinking that their 
masters alone opposed the measure, 
they were excited to take by force 
that which they had been taught to 
look to as their prescriptive right. 
Fortunately the insurrection broke 
out only in Barbadoes: — the vigi- 
lance of the colonial governments 
prevented a similar movement in the 
other island s ; bu t there is great reason 
to fear that in many of them a very 
dangerous spirit still prevails, — and 
indeed must prevail so long as the 
African Institution are allowed to 
pursue their present system. This 
spirit would become altogether un- 
controlable, and lead to the most 
disastrous consequences, if once the 
mother country were to pass the 
boundary line of legislation, set be- 
tween herself and the colonies. 

Thus the British Parliament would 
not only assume a most laborious 
addition to its present duties, but 
would (to use the words of a cele- 
brated writer on the nature of go- 



IS 



vernment) " be in danger of med- 
dling with a number of strings, the 
existence of which it *lw ««« «°w 
suspect. Whil* ** would only pro- 
pose reforn^tion and improvement, 
it wouW be in danger of removing 
the talisman, on which the existence 
of the fabric depends, or, like the 
daughter of King Nisus, of cutting 
off the fatal hair, with which the 
fate of the city is connected." It 
would destroy that confidence in the 
master's protection, tvhich is the 
source of so much satisfaction and 
gratitude in the minds of the negroes ; 
it would undermine that authority of 
the white inhabitants, which *grows 
out of proper control, and is not less 
the best safeguard of the order and 
happiness of their slaves than of their 
own properties. 

From what has been said we may 
safely draw the following conclu- 
sions : — that any interference on the 
part of the British Parliament is un- 
called for and unnecessary — that the 
colonial legislatures must be best 
acquainted with the internal regula- 
tions which should be adopted in 
their slave code — that they have 
proved themselves, by the constantly 
progressive ameliorations, both able 
and willing to pass any laws which 
may encrease the comforts and pro- 
mote the happiness of the black 
population : — that the mother coun- 
try should not be forward to agitate 
questions of this delicate nature be- 
tween herself and the colonies — and 
that any such experiments would be 
dangerous in their nature, and hazard 
substantial benefits for imaginary 
advantages. 

These conclusions are fully borne 
out. by the opinion of a very able 
writer, who is also a member of the 
African Institution. In speaking of 
the colonial legislatures he says, 
" they are fully competent to take 
all the steps that may be necessary 
for improving the system. They are 
precisely in the situation, which en- 
sures the adoption of wise measures; 
they are composed of men immedi- 
ately interested in the pursuit of that 



very conduct, which the good of the 
system requires — all the individuals, 
who form the assemblies, are con- 
cerned in the preservation and in- 
crease of the negro stock ; in the 
improvement of the whole colonial 
society ; in the gradual reformation 
of the general system. Of their 
superior ability to devise and execute 
such measures, we cannot entertain 
the smallest doubt. They are men, 
intimately acquainted with every 
minute branch of colonial affairs, 
and accustomed, from their earliest 
years, to meditate upon no other sub- 
jects. They reside in the heart of 
the system, for which their plans are 
to be laid, and on the success of 
which every experiment is to be 
held. 

"The details of the slave laws re- 
quire more minute and accurate ac- 
quaintance with an infinite variety 
of particulars, which can only be 
known to those, who reside on the 
spot. To revise the domestic codes 
of the colonies, would be a task, 
which no European government 
could undertake, for want of infor- 
mation and for want of lime. Any 
parliament, council or senate, which 
should begin such a work, would 
find it necessary to give up legislat- 
ing for the mother country, in order 
partly to mar, and partly to neglect 
the legislation of the colonies. Let 
this branch of the imperial adminis- 
tration, then, be left to the care of 
those, who are themselves most im- 
mediately interested in the good or- 
der and government of the distant 
provinces, and whose knowledge of 
local circumstances, of those things 
which cannot be written down in re- 
ports, nor told by witnesses, is more 
full and particular."* 

And after all, — who is it that 
would urge us to try this dangerous 
experiment 1 The Directors of the 
African Institution! Yes! these 
few individuals, forming themselves

the Colonial Policy of the Nations of 
Europe."

tinder the imposing title of a "socie- 
ty," are to change the whole nature 
of our West Indian establishments ! 
It may be well, therefore, to enquire 
what claim they have established to 
our confidence as legislators ? whe- 
ther they have any real acquaintance 
with the system, about which they 
talk so much? whether they have 
acquired any experience in the ma- 
nagement of West India estates'? 
and lastly, whether they have, in 
any other instance, shown them- 
selves competent to the regulation of 
distant settlements ? Our limits will 
not permit us to enter into a long 
explanation upon these different 
points: we can do little else, at pre- 
sent, than refer our readers to those 
sources of information, which will 
give them, in detail, the various un- 
fortunate experiments, which the 
Directors have already made. 

1st, If there be any one so scep- 
tical as to doubt the accurate infor- 
mation of the Directors, when they 
tell, us " they have numerous corre- 
spondents in the West Indies, whose 
communications to them are various 
and important;" let him refer to the 
records of the Court of King's Bench, 
where a jury of their countrymen 
has, within these few days, found 
them guilty of a libel against per- 
sons of the highest rank in one of 
our oldest established colonies. This 
libel, which was false in every part, 
was founded on one of those import' 
ant communications from their corre- 
spondents, and will serve at once as 
a specimen of their credulity, and 
of the grounds, on which they lay 
claim to their intimate acquaintance 
with colonial affairs ! 

2nd, How far they can boast of 
experience in the management of 
West India ^property, — will appear 
by referring to the papers, laid be- 
fore the House of Commons on the 
26th of June, 1816, on the subject 
of the Crown-estates in Berbice, 
which were entrusted to the care of 
a few leading Directors of the Afri- 
can Institution, since well known by 



the title of the Berbice Commis- 
sioners. These papers, — particularly 
the letters from Governor Gordon, 
—present a very disu« s j ng picture 
of the consequences, Wi; c h must 
always arise from persons una^tak- 
ing a charge, of which they can have 
no practical knowledge. The prf. 
vations and sufferings of the negroes, 
while under the care of the Com- 
missioners, appear to have been so 
great, as to have attracted the no- 
tice of the Governor in the Colony : 
their want of food amounted al- 
most to a famine, and the numbers 
who died were considerably more 
than double the deficiency, that took 
place in the years preceding their 
management, — After all the calls, 
which were made upon the Trea- 
sury, for the expenses of the estates, 
the account rendered to Parlia- 
ment of the produce arising from 
them, whilst under the care of the 
Commissioners, was " NIL ;" so that 
these large estates, with above 1000 
negroes upon them, instead of yielding 
a considerable revenue to the country, 
have been a burthen to our finances! 
So much for their experience in the 
management of West India estates. 

3d, Need we dwell upon their 
errors in Africa? Let the reader 
look to the details given by their 
own Chief Justice, whose high offi- 
cial situation there, and personal 
observations, gave him the best 
means of estimating the measures, 
which the African Society has pur- 
sued. Let him refer to the account 
of their proceedings, published by 
Mr. Grant, a member of the Coun- 
cil at Sierra Leone, and who was 
twenty years in the service of the 
Institution ! Let him also refer to 
the correspondence, between Gover- 
nor Ludlam and Mr. Zachary Ma- 
caulay, for further evidence of the 
means which the Directors have 
adopted to veil from the public their 
transactions in that unfortunate set- 
tlement, and of their fitness to legis- 
late for the BRITISH WEST IN- 
DIA COLONIES.
