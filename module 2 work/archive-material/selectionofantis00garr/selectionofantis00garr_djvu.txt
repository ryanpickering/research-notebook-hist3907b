PREFACE. 

The rapid multiplication of Anti-Slavery Societies, in various 
portions of our land, and the frequency of their public convoca- 
tions, seem to require a judicious selection of Hymns, descrip- 
tive of the wrongs and sufferings of our slave population, and 
calculated to impress upon the minds of those who read them, 
or commit them to memory, or hear them sung, a deep sense of 
their obligations to assist in undoing every burden, breaking 
■every yoke, and setting every captive free^ ^Hitherto, in all 
meetings for the delivery of anti-slavery .addresses, much em- 
barrassment has been felt, in consequence of the difficulty of 
finding in the Hymn Books which are in tiommon x\se, appro- 
priate pieces to be sung on those occasions : hence, an earnest 
desire has been widely expressed that the defect might be reme- 
died by a collection of anti-slavery hymns. I have therefore 
ventured to make the following collection, as an experiment, 
.which, if it succeed, may lead to something better and more 
voluminous. My materials have been so scant}' as to prevent 
the exercise of taste, and that classification and variet}' which 
are desirable. Some of the pieces are too long, but I have not 
felt authorised to mutilate them, as a few verses may easily be 
selected and sung ; others are intended specially for the use of 
<our colored brethren j others, perhaps, are not adapted to music, 
but may be read profitably. I have acknowledged the names of 
their authors, as far as I have been able to ascertain their origin. 
As the last Monday evening of every month is now extensively 
observed as a Concert of Prayer for the emancipation of 
the slaves, and the redemption of our land^ this little book, it is 
believed, will be found useful on every such occasion. May the 
God of the oppressed bless it to the advancement of the cause 
of humanity and righteousness !

HYMN 1. 

'old Hundred. 

in'd h 

Is lifted up in prayer to thee, 
When earthly thoughts awhile depart, 
And leave the mounting spirit free — 

Then teach us that our love, like thine, 
O'er all the realms of earth should Aott, 

A shoreless stream, a flood divine. 
To bathe and heal the heart of wo. 

Then shall the bondman hear no more 
The tyrant's, in the christian's name, 

Nor tears of wasting anguish pour, 
Unpitied, o'er his life of shame. 

But taught to love thee, by the lov© 
That bids his long-worn fetters break, 

He too shall lift his soul above. 

And serve thee for thy mercy's sake.

HYMN 2. 

St. Martins. 

Hark to the clank ! what means that sound ? 

'Tis slavery shakes its chains ! 
Man driving man in fetters bound, — 

And this where freedom reigns ! 

Say, what have these poor wretches done, 
That chains their lot should be ? 

Are they not punished to atone 
For some great robbery ? 

Or black atrocious homicide, 

Or treasonable plan ? 
Ah no ! to pamper human pyde, 

Man chains his fellow man ! 

Man's flesh and blood each day behold, 

Like swine to market driven ; 
God's noblest creatures bought and sold 

By Christians ! Heirs of Heaven ! 

Great God ! does such hypocrisy 

Not call for vengeance due ? 
Shall patriots shout for liberty, 

And act the tyrant too ? 

They say, by nature all are free, 

But blush when truth unfolds, 
To own how black his heart must be, 

Who lives by trading souls. 



7 

HYMN 3. 



Devizes. 



Who is thy neighbor ! — see him stand 
With sunken cheek and eye, 

Where hunger shows the empty hand 
Thy bounty can supply ! 

Go where the widow'd mother pines 
For what thou well canst spare — 

Where palsied age in want reclines, 
And see thy neighbor there ! 

Behold him in the stranger, cast 

Upon a foreign shore, 
Who, homeless, in the cutting blast, 

Is shiv'ring at thy door ! 



Go seek him 'mid the dungeon's gloom, 

And carry comfort there ; 
And on the living in that tomb, 

Call blessings down by prayer. 

He's in thine enemy, who gave 
Thee wounds that open still ! 

For him of Heaven forgiveness crave, 
And pay him good for ill. 

Look, where the sable captive sighs 
For rights enjoy'd by thee ! 

He is thy neighbor — loose his ties, 
And set the bondman free. 



8 



Columbia, favor'd of the skies ! 

How can thy banner wave, 
While at thy feet thy neighbor lies 

A crush'd and fetter'd slave ? 

There is a blot among* thy stars— 

A chord is in thy hand — 
A stain upon thy face, that mars 

The beauty of our land ! 

Thou noble Tree of Liberty ! 

Should not thy verdure fade 
O'er him who would his neighbor see 

Excluded from thy shade ? 

Did they who rear'd thee by their toil, 

Not will thy fruit to be 
Alike, for all who tread our soil, 

A harvest sweet and free ? 

Philanthropy, from every breast 

Thy streams should ceaseless flow, — 

Our neighbor 's in the weak, th' opprest- 
And every child of wo ! 



HYMN 4. 

Jirattle Street. 

That dearest name ! ay, even thou, 
Poor slave, may'st lift thine eye, 

Nor dread a chilling glance of scorn 
Will meet thee from the sky. 



9 



Go bend the knee, and raise the soul, 

And lift thy hopes above, 
The God of heaven is e'en to thee, 

A Father in his love. 

The earth-worm, man, may crush thee down 

To slavery and shame. 
And in his puny pride usurp 

A Master's haughty name ; 

But He, Lord God Omnipotent, 

Disdaineth not to bear 
A parenfs cherished name to thee, 

To yield a parent's care. 

Ar\f{ fhnn Vinfh nJiilrllikfi nonfideUCfi. 



10 

Our Father ! oh, how deeply dear 

That holy name should be — 
How should we love the meanest one 

Who thus may call on Thee ! 

And yet thou just and righteous God ! 

If thou wert not our sire, 
Long since we had been swept away 

By thy consuming ire. 



HYMN 5. 

Benevento.

HYMN 6. 

Sicilian Hymn. 

Natives of a land of glory, 

Daughters of the good and brave, 

Hear the injured bondman's story. 
Hear, and help the kneeling slave. 

Think, how nought but death can sever 
Your lov'd children from your hold ; 

Still alive — ^but lost forever — 

Ours are parted, bought and sold ! 

Seize, oh ! seize each favoring season — 
Scorning censure or applause ; 

Justice, Truth, Religion, Reason, 
Are your Leaders in our cause ! 

Follow ! — faithful, firm, confiding — 

Spread our wrongs from shore to shore ; 

Mercy's God your efforts guiding, 
Slavery shall be known no more. 



12 



X\UU Uidiy bliau X uv. v^i w.^_-^ 

He whom as Christians ye adore, 
Root in your hearts humanity, 
And trampled human rights restore ; 

While with oppressive wrongs you sway, 
Do you God's holy will perform ? 

Does He such tyranny display ? 
Did He for slaves to men us form ? 

Ah ! no, the God and judge of all 

Hath oft withdrawn his chastening hand ; 

That mercy freely shewn to all. 
Let flourish o'er a christian land. 

Dare not to mock your Saviour's name, 
By actions with which misery blends ; 

What you profess, by works proclaim. 
And be the Negro's guiding friends ; 

Nor them from home and kindred tear, 
And with a lawless curse pursue ; 

In pity hear, in mercy spare. 
Lest heaven its mercy turn from you. 



13 

Oh ! let the bleeding slaves be free 
From Slavery's disgraceful chain ! 

Give them their right — their liberty — 
Then own your Saviour's holy name* 



HYMN 8. 

St. Ann's, 

From every clime beneath the skies, 
Profaned by Slavery's chain, 

The prayers of captive millions rise ; 
And shall they plead in vain ? 

Shall man, of little power possess'd, 

His fellow worm inthral ; 
And rudely from his brother wrest 

A blessing — given to all ? 

Yes ! thus it is ; — yet, not unpaid. 

His tyranny prevails ; 
And all his barbarous deeds are weigh'd 

In Heaven's unerring scales. 

And when the dark and silent grave 
Its gloomy jaws shall close, 

And the stern master and his slave 
Alike in dust repose, — 

Each bursting sigh, each bitter tear, 
Each bosom's tortured beat, 

Shall then in black array appear 
Before the judgment seat. 

B 



14 

HYMN 9. 



Christmas. 



Rise, freemen, rise ! the call goes forth ; 

List to the high command — 
Obedience to the word of God, 

Throughout this mighty land. 

Rise, free the slave ! oh ! burst his chains ; 

His fetters cast ye down ; 
Let virtue be your country's pride, 

Her diadem and crown, — 

That the blest day may soon arrive, 

When equal all shall be. 
And freedom's banner waving higb 

Proclaim that all are free. 



HYMN 10. 

Italian HymK. 

With thy pure dews and rains, 
Wash out, O God, the stains 

From Afric's shore ; 
And, while her palm trees bud. 
Let not her children's blood 
With her broad Niger's flood 

Be mingled more ! 



15 

Quench, righteous God, the thirst 
That Congo's sons hath cursed — 

The thirst for gold ! 
Shall not thy thunders speak, 
Where Mammon's altars reek, 
Where maids and matrons shriek, 

Bound, bleeding, sold ? 

Hear'st thou, O God, those chains, 
Clanking on Freedom's plains. 

By Christians wrought ! 
Them, who those chains have worn, 
Christians from home have torn. 
Christians have hither borne. 

Christians have bought ! 

Cast down, great God, the fanes 
That, to unhalloYfed gains, 

Round us have risen — 
Temples, whose priesthood pore 
Moses and Jesus o'er, 
Then bolt the black man's door, 

The poor man's prison ! 

Wilt thou not, Lord, at last. 
From thine own image, cast 

Away all cords, 
But that of love, which brings 
Man, from his wanderings, 
Back to the King of kings,. 

The Lord of lords! 



16 

HYMN 11. 



Rothwell. 



When injured Afric's captive claim, 
Loads the sad gale with startling nnoan, 

The frown of deep indignant blame 
Bend not on Southern climes alone. 

Her toil, and chain, and scalding tear, 
Our daily board with luxuries deck, 

And to dark slavery's yoke severe, 
Ou7' fathers help'd to bow her neck. 

If slumbering in the thoughtful breast. 
Or justice or compassion dwell, 

Call from their couch the hallowed guest. 
The deed to prompt, the prayer to swell. 

Oh, lift the hand, and Peace shall bear 
Her olive where the palm tree grows, 

And torrid Afric's desert share 
The fragrance of salvation's rose. 

But if with Pilate's stoic eye. 

We calmly wash when blood is spilt; 

Or deem a cold, unpitying sigh. 

Absolves us from the stain of guilt ; 

Or if, like Jacob's recreant train, 
Who traffick'd in a brother's wo, 

We hear the suppliant plead in vain, 
Or mock his tears that wildly flow ; 



17 



Will not the judgments of the skies, 

Which threw a shield round Joseph sold, 

Be roused by fetter'd Afric's cries. 

And change to dross th' oppressor's gold ? 



HYMN 12. 

Missionary Hymn. 

Think of our country's glory. 
All dimm'd with Afric's tears — ■ 

Her broad flag stained and gory 
With th' hoarded guilt of years. 

Think of the frantic mother, 

Lamenting for her child, 
Till falling lashes smother 

Her cries of anguish wild ! 

Think of the prayers ascending, 
Yet shrieked, alas ! in vain, 

When heart from heart is rending. 
Ne'er to be joined again ! 

Shall we behold, unheeding, 
Life's holiest feelings crush'd ?— 

When woman's heart is bleeding. 
Shall woman's voice be hush'd ? 

Oh, no ! by every blessing. 
That Heaven to thee may lend — 

Remember their oppression. 
Forget not, sister, friend. 

B 2 



HYMN 13. 

Greenville. 
Heaven help ye, lorn ones ! bending 

'Neath your weary life of pain, 
Tears of ceaseless anguish blending 

With the bitter cup ye drain ; 
Yet think not your prayers ascending, 

Shall forever rise in vain ! 

Hearts there are, of human feeling, 
That have felt your cry of wo : 

Bear awhile ! and soon revealing 
Brighter prospects with its glow, 

Light across your night-clouds stealing. 
Hours of freedom yet may show. 



HYMN 14. 

Eaton. 
It is the wrongs of Afric's sons 

We feel, — and would our aid extend 
Unto the injured sufPring ones, 

Who loudly call us to befriend, 
When their deep groans ascend on high 
In piercing heart- wrung agony. 

Too long, too long in Freedom's land 
Oppression holds her iron sway, — 

O rescue from the tyrant's hand. 
His feeble, unresisting prey, 

Until the voice of Liberty 

Proclaims that all her sons are free. 



23 

HYMN 18. 

Old Hundred; 

Oh ! if to Afric's sable race 

A fearful debt we justly owe, 
If heaven's dread book record the trace 

Of ev'ry deed and thought below — 

And if for them the Christian prayer 
Implores of God to guide and save, 

Then let these helpless suppliants share 
From mercy's store the mite they crave* 

Touch deep for them the pitying breast, 
Bid bounty's stream flow warm and free ; 

For who can tell, among the blest, 
Hotv sweet their harps of praise may be ? 



HYMN 19. 

German Hymn^ 

Let mammon hold while mammon can, 
The bones and blood of living man ; 
Let tyrants scorn while tyrants dare, 
The shrieks and writhings of despair ; 

The end will come, it will not wait, 
Bonds, yokes and scourges have their date ; 
Slavery itself must pass away, 
And be a tale of yesterday. 



24 

HYMN 20. 



Sbirland, 



God gave to Afric's sons, 

A brow of sable dye, — 
And spread the country of their birth 

Beneath a burning sky,' — 

With olive cheek he made 

The little Hindoo child, 
And darkly stained the forest tribes 

That roam our western wild. — 

To us, he gave a form 

Of fairer, whiter clay, — - 
But are we therefore, in his sight, 

Respected more than they ? — 

'Tis th' hue of deeds and thoughts 

He traces in His Book, — 
'Tis the complexion of the heart. 

On which He deigns to look. 

Not by the tinted cheek 

That fades away so fast, 
But by the color of the soul 

We shall be judged at last. 

The Lord will look at us 

With anger in His eyes, 
If we our brother's darker brow 

Should ever dare despise. 



25 

HYMN 21. 



Orland, 



Victims of tyranny and lust, 
In brutal servitude who pine ; 

In your Creator be your trust, 
And plead his promises divine. 

Helpless and faint as you may be, 
And the oppressor stout and strong, 

Who dares to call his property, 
The beings who to God belong: 

^here is an eye that pities you — 
An arm almighty, strong to save — 

A voice shall strike with terror through 
The tyrant, and redeem the slave. 

He '11 tarry not, the awful One — 
His chariot now begins to move! 

The year of jubilee's begun. 
The reign of sympathy and love ! 



HYMN 23. 

Sicilian Hymn. 

Saviour! though by scorn requited, 

Oft'ner than by gratitude. 
Still on earth thy soul delighted 

Constantly in doing good, 

c 



26 

Wealth, complexion, grandeur, stationj^ 
Vain distinctions were to thee : 

Love like thine, nor caste nor nation 
Bounded its infinity. 

Thou didst heal the lame — the dying j 
Feed the multitude with bread ;, 

Not a suppliant denying' ; 
Raising up to life the dead t 

Even on the cross expiring. 

Agonized beyond comparOy 
(Filial love new strength acquiring,) 

She who bore thee claimed thy care,. 

To the loved disciple turning — 

* See thy mother ! ' — Lord, 'tis done t 
Then to her, with bosom yearning, — 

* Woman, there behold thy son L' 

As the Way to glory leading, 
As the Truth that sets us free, 

As the Light from heaven proceeding,, 
Chiefly do we honor thee.. 

* Fbi^Low ME ! '— Yes, precious Saviour, 
In thy footsteps will we tread ; 

Bj'' thy grace, our whole behaviour 
Shall be worthy of our Head ! 

Help us every chain to sever — 

Every captive to set free — 
And our guilty land deliver 

From the curse of slavery 1 



21 

HYMN 23. 

Newport. 
Juight of the world, arise ! arise ! 
On Africa thy glories shed ; 
Fetter'd, in darkness deep she lies 
With weeping eye, and drooping head* 

Through gloomy wilds which shade her shore, 
The blood-stain'd murderer seeks his prey; 
Those shrieks, — that light — 'tis seen no more, 
The victims where, O where are they ? 

Why heed their doom ? for hope can give 
To death e'en beauty's softest light ; 
It conquers pain, its raptures live, 
When fades whatever of earth is bright. 

But what avails, if yet unknown 
Hope's kindling flame and living power ? 
Come they not from th' eternal Throne ? 
Cheer they the sinner's dying hour ? 

Light of the world, arise I arise J 
Millions in tears await the day ; 
Shine cloudless forth, O cheer our eyes, 
And banish sin and grief awaj. 



HYMN 24. 

Dover. 
Oh ! hear the wailin» cry ; 
The wretched slave complains, 
His brother's hand deep wrong inflicts, 
And binds in galling chains. 



23 

With scoffs that brother seeff 
Those chains his body bind, 
And draws the more debasing cords. 
Around th' immortal mind. 

Oh, melt those flinty hearts,- 
Strong- prejudice remove, 
And teach thy paler children, Lord,> 
Thy sable sons to love. 

Hast thou not promised long ? 
We fain the day would see^. 
When Ethiopia's trampled song 
Shall stretch the hand to thee. 

Then speed the joyful time. 
Bend every heart of pride, 
Till humbled lord, and slave set freey. 
Shall worship side by side.. 



HYMN 25. 

Evening Hymn. 

The hour of freedom! come it must — 
O, hasten it, in mercy, Heaven ! 

When all who grovel in the dust. 
Shall stand erect, their fetters riven ! 

When glorious freedom shall be won 
By every caste, complexion, clime i 

When tyranny shall be o'erthrown, 
And color cease^o be a crime I 



29 

Friend of the poor — long suffering Lord ! 

This guilty land from ruin save ! 
Let Justice sheathe his glitt'ring sword, 

And Mercy rescue from the grave ! 

And ye, who are like cattle sold, 
And vilely trodden like the earth. 

And bartered constantly for gold — 

Your souls debased from their high birth 

Bear meekly still your cruel woes ; 

Light follows darkness — comfort, pain : 
So time shall give you sweet repose, 

And sever every hateful chain. 

Not by the sword your liberty 

Shall be obtained, in human blood ; 

Not by revolt or treachery, — 
Revenge did never bring forth good : 

Crod's time is best — 'twill not delay — • 
E'en now your cause is blossoming, 

And rich shall be the fruit : — the day 
Of your redemption loudly sing I 



HYMN 26. 

Bear'st thou a man's, a Christian's name ? 
If not for pity, yet for shame, 

O, fling the scourge aside ; 
Her tender form may writhe and bleed. 
But deeper cuts thy barbarous deed 

The female's modest pride. 

e 2 



30 

Sin first hy woman came ; — for this 
The Lord hath marr'd her earthly bliss, 

With many a bitter throe ; 
But mercy tempers wrath, and scorn 
Pursues the wretch who adds a thorn 

To heaven inflicted wo. 

Thine infancy was lulled to rest 
On woman's nurt'ring bosom prest, 

Enfolded by her arm ; 
Her hand upheld thy tott'ring pace ; — 
And oh ! how deep the foul disgrace, 

If thine can work her harm ! 

Hush not thy nature's conscious plea ; 
Weak, helpless, succorless, to thee 

Her looks for mercy pray : 
He who records each lash, will roll 
Torrents of vengeance on thy soul ! — 

Oh ! fling that scourge away ! 



HYMN 27. 

Lo, in southern skies afar, 
Mounted on Oppression's car, 
Rides a pale and sickly star — 

God of slavery ; 
Misery, with ghastly train, 
Dealing horror, wo and pain, 
Sweeps along his fell domain, 

Like the troubled sea. 



33 



Here behold your ojffspring squandered — 

Chains and stripes their liberty. 
O, poor Afric ! O, poor Afric ! 
Chains and, stripes their liberty. 

Ah ! that slavers should have brought ye. 
From your land — your bodies sold ! 

Ah, that Christians should have bought ye, 
Should oppress ye still for gold I 

O, poor Afric ! O, poor Afric ! 
Ye are still oppressed for^s'old^ 



HYMN 29. 

Swanwick. 

While on the distant Hindoo shore 

Messiah's cross is reared. 
While Pagan votaries bow no more 

With idol blood besmeared-— 



34 

While Palestine again doth hear 

The Gospel's joyful sound, 
While Islam's crescents disappear 

From Calvary's holy ground- 
Say, shall not Afric's fated land 

With news of grace be blest? 
Say, shall not Ethiopia's band, 

Enjoy the promised rest ? 



oiavc 111 yvjui inj\xi.i. 



What are your sorrows to that he bears ? 
Quenching the light of his bosom's glow, 
With a life-long stain of gushing tears. 

Think of the slave in your hours of prayer, 
When worldly thoughts in your hearts are dim; 

Offer your thanks for the bliss ye share. 
But pray for a brighter lot for him. 



35 

HYMN 31. 



Truro. 



O Lord ! whose forming hand one blood 
To all the tribes and nations gave, 

And giv'st to all their daily food, 
Look down in pity on the slave ! 

Fetters and chains and stripes remove. 
And freedom to their bodies give ; 

And pour the tide of light and love 
Upon their souls, and bid them live. 

Oh, kindle in our hearts a flame 

Of zeal, thy holy will to do ; 
And bid each child, who loves thy name, 

To love his bleeding brother too. 

We send to foreign shores thy word. 
To guide to Thee the steps that roam : 

Shall we forget the myriads, Lord, 
Who sit in darkness here at home ? 

Bend the proud hearts, the iron hands, 
That vex thy sable children so. 

Till they undo the heavy bands. 
And let their sighing captives go. 

Through all thy temples, let the stain 
Of prejudice each bosom flee ; 

And hand in hand, let Afric's train, 
With Europe's children, worship thee.. 



36 



HYMN 32.* 

Sweet Home. 

Great God, if the humble and weak are as dear 
To thy love as the proud, to thy children give ear! 
Our brethren Avould drive us in deserts to roam ; 
Forgive them, O Fatlier, and keep us at home. 

Home, sweet home ! 

We know of no other ; this, this is our home* 

Here, here our loved mothers, relax'd from their toils 
To watch o'er our cradles and joy in our smiles ;. 
Here the bones of our fathers lie buried ; and here 
Are friends, wives, and children, ay, all we hold dear. 
Home, sweet home, &c. 

Here is law, here is learning, and here we may move, 
Most merciful God, in the light of thy love. 
Boasts Afric such blessings ? Oppressors, declare ! 
Oh no, we may seek but shall not find them there. 
Home, sweet home, &c. 

Columbia, dear land of our birthright ! may He, 
Who made us a people, rain blessings on thee ! 
From thy bosom no pleading shall tempt us to roam ; 
Till force drive us from it, this, this is our home. 

Home, sweet home, 

Till force drive us from it, this, this is our home. 



* This Hymn is expressive of the sentiments of the colored 
population of this country, with regard to the wild and cruel 
scheme of African Colonization. 

THE END.
