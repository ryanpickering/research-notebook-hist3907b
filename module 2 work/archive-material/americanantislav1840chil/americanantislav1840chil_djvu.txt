"NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE."— " no concern with slavery.' 
To ask a man what right he has to interfere with slavery, is the most 
outrageous insult that can be oiFered to human nature. He \A\o would 
not feel his whole being either breaking forth with indignation, or over 
flowing with pity xipon the besotted soul who could ask such a question, 
is himself a slave in nature whatever he may be in name. He is a traitor 
to his race, who does not feel that all within the circle of humanity are his 
brothers and sisters — that their wrongs are his wrongs, and that his cup is 
dashed with the bitterness wliich overflovv'^s from theirs. While a single 
human being, round the wide world, drags the chain or drops the tear of 
a slave, every other human being, v;liose heart has not turned to stone, 
will cry out against the Wretch who riveted the one or wrings out the other, 
What ! has human nature no heart for human nature ? human beings " no 
concern" when the oppressor drives his iron into their common humanity 
and bows under his yoke the necks of their fellows ? Have the sons of 
liberty " no right to interfere" when their own mother's children are robbed 
of their birthright ? To be a freeman, and yet have " no concern" about 
slavery — what a monstrous anomaly ! Every human being who refuses to 
protest against slavery in the name of his own outraged nature, is an apos- 
tate from humanity. Every freeman who refuses to do it, impeaches hi 
own pohtical rights and undermines their foundation. Every Christian who 
refuses, makes Christ the minister of sin, and the great patron of bondage

^4 Anti- Slavery Almanac. 1840.] 



MOBS— FREE DISCUSSION RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE — 

THINGS TO BE THOUGHT OF. 

The object of law is to protect rights, — the object of government is to 
administer this protection. Government is in its very nature a pledge of 
protection to every one of its subjects. Every voluntary subject of the 
government does, in the very terms of his allegiance, pledge his power 
for the protection of every one of his fellow subjects, and if he refuses to 
aid in protecting them, he violates the conditions, and forfeits the sole 
tenm-e of his own claim to protection; amd hj permitting the rights of 
others to be trampled upon, he tramples on them himself; and not only 
so, but upon the laws which protect those rights, and upon the govern- 
ment which administers that protection, and upon every member of the 
community — for the rights of all are left without defence, when protec- 
tion is refused to the rights of any. 

Further, it is the right of tlie people " peaceably to assemble," and dis- 
cuss all subjects ; if a mob break in upon them, and the civil officers 
(which are the local government,) refuse to protect the assembly, they 
do, by that act, join the mob, and become its leaders, thus turning the 
government itself into a mob. If the civil officers act in accordance 
with the wishes of the mass of the people, (as is almost always the case,) 
then the community becomes a mob — and every member of it, who re- 
fuses to protect the rights of his fellow citizens, not only virtually per. 
jures himself, but violates his own claim to legal protection. 

To exercise one's rigrhts is the business of the individual : to protect 
him in the exercise of them, is the business of the government — and well 
may he say to it, '' See thou to that," 

The exercise of a right by the subject of a government is his draft on 
that government for protection in the exercise of that right ; every such 
draft the government is sacredly bound to honor — it has no option in the 
case — it has no power to protest such a draft, and, if it does, it violates its 
charter — ^the government has broke — it has annihilated itself. 

The foregoing principles furnish a looking-glass for all mobocrats, es- 
pecially those of high degree — it gives full-length likenesses of the civil 
authorities of New York, in the summer of '34, of Boston and Utica, Oct. 
'35, of Cincinnati, July, '36, of Troy, in June, '36, of Alton, in Nov., 
'37, of Philadelphia, May 17, '38, and of all other civil officers who have 
helped to mob abolitionists, and of all the people who have " loved to 
have it so." 

«' HARD LANGUAGE." 

" Unless the holder of a slave believes it conscientiously to be his duty 
to hold him, he is worse than a pirate." — Speech of Mr. Weems, of Md., 
(a slaveholder,) in Congress, Jan. 28, 1828.— iVaf. Intel. Feb. 1. 

WORK FOR ABOLITIONISTS. 

Reader, have you signed the abolition petitions to Congress and your 
State Legislature yet ? Have you asked all your neighbors to sign them ? 
If not, do it at once. Have you established an anti-slavery library in your 
neighborhood ? Five dollars' will buy the most important abolition works. 
Have you a " negro seat" in the place for worship which you attend ? If 
so, testify against it, not by words merely ; they are a cheap testimony — 
but go and sit in it, and show that you worship a God, who "is no re- 
specter of persons," and will not be a "partaker of other men's sins." 
Are you a mechanic or an artist ? take a colored youth as an appren- 
tice. A merchant ? take one as a clerk. A physician, or a lawyer ? take 
one as a student. Let your life always preach against slavery.

HOW SLAVERY IMPROVES THE CONDITION OF WOMEN. 

" John RufFner, a plaveholder, had one slave named Piney, whom he, 
jaa well as Mrs. RufFner, would often flog very severely. I frequently saw 
jMrs. RufFner flog her with the broom, sliovel, or anything she could seize' 
iin her rage. She would knock her down and then kick and stamp her 
Imost unmercifully, until she would be apparently so lifeless, that I more,' 
jthaaonee thought she would never recover. The cause of Piney's flogging 
iwas not working enough, or making some mislukc in baking, &lc. (Sec." — \ 
fflirs. N. Lowry, a native of Ky., now nieiittier of' a Church, in Osnaburg, Stark co. Ohio.j 

" My uncle used to tie his " house wench" to a peach tree in the yard, 
and whip her till there was no sound place to lay another stroke, and re.; 
ipeat it so often that her back was continually sore. Whipping the feJ 
males around the legs, was a favorite mode of punishment with him. 
They mvist stand and hold up their clothes while he plied his Jiickory." — 
Win. Leftvvich, a native of Virginia, and sou of a slavcliolder, now member of Uwa 
Fiesbvterian Church, Dellii, Ohio. j 

♦' in the winter of 1828-29, I put up for a night at Frost Town, on the 
national road. Soon after there came in a slaver with a drove of slavesj 
I then left the room, and shortlj' afterwards heard a screum, and whenj 
the landlady inquired the cause, the slaver coolly told her not to trouble 
herself, he v.-as only chastising one of his women. — It appeared that threfej 
days previously her child ha-d died on the road, and been thrown into a 
crevice in the mountain, and a few stones throv.-n over it ; and the mother 
weeping for her child was chastised by her master, and told by him, she: 
' should have something to cry for.' " — ColonelT. Rogere, a native of Kentucky,' 
a Presbyterian elder at New Petersburg, Hiphkuul cu. Ohio. j 

" Benjamin Lewis, an elder in the Presbyterian church, engaged a 
carpenter to repair his house. Kyle, the builder, was awakened veryi 
early in the morning by a most piteous moaning and shrieking. He 
iarose, and following the sound, discovered a colored wotnan, nearly; 
jnaked, tied to a fence, while Lewis was lacerating her. A second and a 
jthird scene of the same kind occurred, and on the third occasion the al-j 
jtercation almost produced a battle betvv-een the elder and the carpenter."] 
— Rev. George Bourne, of New York, v-ho was a preacher seven years iu Yiriinia. } 
I James T. De Jarnett, Vernon, Autauga co. Alabama, thus advertises aj 
iwoman in the Pensacola Gazette, July 14, 1838. "Celia is a brig1it\ 
copper- colored negress, fine figure and very smart. On examining her. 
back., you lo ill find marks caused hy the v.-hip." 

I P. Abdie, advertises a woman in the N. O. Bee, of Jan. 29, 1838, " hav-j 
jing marks of the whip behind her neck, and secerul others on her rump.^^

PETITIONS TO CONGRESS, 

The twenty-sixth Congress will assemble December 2d, 1839. Let a 
host of petitions meet them on the threshold. Let every man and woman 
who is true to liberty, PETITION. If you have never petitioned for the 
abolition of slavery, begin now : show that yon value your own hberty by 
praying that those who are robbed of theirs may be robbed no longer. 
Prove yourselves worthy of freedom by doing freedom's work. In the 
name of liberty pray that her own children may no longer be cheated out 
of their birthright. Who can sit still while men are market- wares in the 
District of Columbia ? The naiioTfs plantation is a slave jail-yard ; the old 
homestead of the Republic is a human shambles ; its hearth -stone rings with 
the chain-clank, and smokes with the fresh blood of woiaan's seourgings. 

He who can hold bis peace at such a time as this — the palsy of slavery 
is on his tongue, its leprosy rises on his forehead, its plague spot has spread 
over his heart. He may still shake the rattle of liberty, and trick himself 
out in its gewgaws ; he may mouth its words, and strut in its livery, but 
he is a slave ; the spirit of liberty is dead within him — the yoke is on his 
neck, and his false tongue licks the dust. He who will net cry aloud

LOOSE THE BANDS OF WICKEDNESS, BREAK EVERY YOKE. 

Reader, the above picture is no fancy-sketch — if you think so, read 
the following testimony of Hiram White, a native of Chatham county, 
North Carolina, now a member of the Baptist Church at Otter Creek 
Prairie, Illinois. William White testifies to the same fact : 

" Mr. Hedding, of Chatham county, held a slave woman. In order to 
prevent her running away, a child, about seven years of age, was con- 
nected with her by a long ekain fastened round her neck, and in this situ- 
ation she was compelled all the day to grub up the roots of shrubs and 
saplings, to prepare ground for the plougli. I travelled past Hedding's 
as often as once in two \Veeks in the winter of 1828, and always saw her." 

The following is an extract from the diary of Rev. Elias Cornelius : — 
"New Orleans, Sabbath, February 15, 1818. Early this morning ac- 
companied A. H. Esq. to the hospital. In the first room we entered, a 
poor negro man was lying upon a couch, an mox collar two inches wide 

AND HALF AN INCH THICK, WAS CLASPED A30UT HIS NECK." Edwards' Life of 

Cornelius, page 101. 

Extract of a letter from Col. Thomas Rogers, an elder in the Presby- 
terian Church at Petersburg, Highland Co., Ohio : — " When a boy, in 
Bourbon Co., Ky., my father lived near a slaveholder of the name of Clay. 
I saw one of this man's slaves, about seventeen years old, wearing a collar, 
with long iron horns extending from his shoulders far above his head." 

John M. Nelson, of Highland Co., Ohio, brother in law of Ex-Governor 
Trimble, says, in a recent letter — " In Staunton, Va., at the house of Mr. 
Robert M'Dowcll, a merchant of that place, I once saw a colored woman, 
of intelligent and dignified appearance, attending to the business of the 
house, -with an iron collar around her neck, with horns or prongs extend- 
ing out on either side, and up, until they met at about a foot above her 
head, at which point there was a bell attached. This yoke, as they called 
it, I understood was to prevent her from running away, or to punish her 
for having done so. I have frequently seen men with iron collars." 

Rev. John Dudley, Mount Moris, Michigan, who was in Mississippi 
in 1830, testifies as follows : — " I saw a poor fellow compelled to work at 
' logging,' with a galling /eifer on his ankles, the weight of which can be 
judged by its size. It was at least three inches wide, half an inch thick, 
and something over a foot long. Whenever he hfted, the fetter rested on 
his bare ankles. If he Ibst his balance and made a misstep, which must 
very often occur in lifting and rolling logs, the torture of his fetter was 
severe. Thus he was doomed to work, day after day." 



1840.] MARCH— THIRD MONTH. [31 days. 

jwhen the rights of others are cloven down, not only tarns traitor to hu- 
man nature, but springs a mine under his own rights. And whoever pro- 
tests against the robbery of others' rights, and pleads for their restoration, 
does most effectually defend, and give dignity and sacredness to his own. 

Let petitions to congress be immediately put in circulation, 

1st, For the immediate abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. 

2d. For the prohibition of the internal slave-trade. 

3d. For the emancipation of the nation's 25,000 slaves in Florida. 

4th. For the recognition of Haiti as an independent nation. 

5thi For the repeal of the unconstitutional act of 1793. 
A SUGGESTION— A TOUCH-STONE. 

If the twenty-sixth congress should snatch at the infamy of its prede- 
cessors by adopting the gag, let petitions be immediately sent in, praying 

1st. That religious liberty may be secured to every person in the District. 
2d. The rights of marriage. 3d. The right of the laborer to his wages. 
4th. The right of all to instruction, &.c., &,c.

which they have "tamed the rascals." — Rev. Horace Moulton , of the M. E.

you speak out for Liberty ? Weigh well the claims of the different candi-

I. M.iRTiN Van Bursn. Before his election in 1836, he declared to you,

HUNTING SLAVES WITH D0(4S AND GUNS. 

The St. Francisvilic (La.) Chronicle, of Feb. 1, 1839, gives the follow- 
ing account of a ' negro hunt,' in that Parish. 

" Two or three days since, a gentleman of this parish, in hunting run- 
away negroes, came upon a camp of them in the swamp, arrested two of 
them, but the third made fight ; and upon being shot in the shoulder, fled 
to a sluice, where the dogs succeeded in drowning him." 

The Rev. Francis Hawlcy, pastor of the Baptist Church in Cokbrook, 
Ct, lived fourteen years in N. and S. Carolina. He says : ''Runaway 
slaves are frequently hunted with guns and dogs. I was once out on such an 
excursion, with my rife and tico dogs. I trust the Lord has forgiven me !" 

" Hunting men with dogs. — A negro who had absconded from hie 
master, has been apprehended and committed to prison in Savannah. 
The editor who states the fact, adds, that he did not surrender till he was 
considpY'ibly maimed by the dogs." — N«w York Com Advcitiser, Junes, 1527 

It is common to keep dogs on the plantations, to pursue and catch run. 
away slaves. — Nehemiah Caulkins, Waterfonl, Ct., who lived in North Carolina. 

There was a man living in Savannah when I was there, who kept a 
large number of dogs for no other purpose than to hunt runaway negroes. 
And ho always had enough of this work to do. — Rev. H.Moulton, Marlboro'Mass.

back and right arm, caused by a rifle ball:' — Natchez Courier, June 15, 1838. 

«' Ranaway Caleb, is shot in the thigh." — Macon Messenger, May 25, 1837. 

" Ranaway Hanibleton, limps where he was shot a few weeks ago,

*' The object of that bill,'' to use the language of Judge Jay, " vvas, by 
means of federal legislation, to build around the slave states, a rampari 
against the assatllts of light and truth. Its absurdity veas equalled only by 
its wickedness. Not a newspaper containing a debate in Congress, a re- 
port from a committee, a message from the president, a letter from the 
West Indies ♦ touching the subject of slavery,' could be legally delivered 
from a southern post office ; and thousands of post-masters were to be em- 
ployed in opening envelopes, and poring over their contents to catch a 
reference to the *' Domestic Institution." By this bill, the Federal Govern- 
ment virtually surrendered to the states, the freedom of the press, and 
nullified the guarantee of this inestimable privilege, given by our fathers 
in the Constitution to every citizen. This bill, moreover, prepared the 
way for the destruction of civil and religious liberty. If every paper touch- 
ing the subject of slavery might be suppressed, then the same fate might

SELLING A MOTHER FROM HER CHILD. 

" ' Do you often buy the wife without the husband ?' ' Yes, very often ; 
3.nd frequently, too, they sell me the mother while they keep her children. 
I have often known them take away the infant from its mother's breast, 
and kaep it, v/hile they sold her.' " — Prof. Andrews, late of the University 
of N. C, in his recent work on Slavery and the Slave-Trade, p. 147, relates 
the foregoing conversation with a slave-trader on the Potomac. 

Hon. James K. Paulding, the Secretary of the Navy of the U. States, 
in his " Letters from the South," published in 1817, says he heard a 
slave-trader say — " Many is the time I have separated wives from hus- 
bands, and husbands from wives, and parents from children ; but then I 
made them amends by marrying them again as soon as I had a chance ; 
that is to say, I made them call each other man and wife, and sleep to- 
gether, which is quite enough for negroes. I made one bad purchase, 
though,' continued he. ' I bouglit a young mulatto girl, a lively crea- 
ture, a great bargain. She had been the favorite of her master, who had 
lately married. The difficulty was to get her to go, for the poor creature 
loved her master. However, I swore most bitterly I was only going to 

take her to her mother's at , and she went with me, though she 

seemed to doubt me very much. But when she discovered, at last, that 
we were out of the state, I thought she would go mad; and, in fact, the 
next night she drowned herself in the river close by. I lost a good five 
hundred dollars by this foolish trick.' " — Vol. I. p. 121. 

'' One of my neighbors sold to a speculator a negro boy, about 14 years 
old. It was more than his poor mother could bear. Her reason fled, 
and she became a perfect maniac, and had to be kept in close confine- 
ment. She would occasionally get out and run off to the neighbors. 
On one of these occasions she came to my house. With tears rolhng 
down her cheeks, and her frame shaking with agony, she would cry out, 
' donH you hear him — they are whipping him now, and he is calling for 
me ." This neighbor of mine, who tore the boy away from his poor 
mother, and thus broke her heart, was a member of the Presbyterian 
church.'''' — Rev. Francis Haioley, Baptist Minister, Colebrook, Ct. 

"Absconded from the subscriber, a negro man, by the name of "Wil- 
son. He was born in the county of New Kent, and raised by a gentle- 
man named Ratliffe, and by him sold to a gentleman named Taylor, on 
whose farm he had a wife and several children. Taylor sold him to Mr. 
Slater, who, in consequence of removing to Alabama, Wilson left; and 
when retaken was sold, and afterwards purchased, by his present owner, 
from T. McCargo & Co., of Richmond."— Richmond Whig, July 2b, 1837.

just as constitutionally be awarded to every paper touchii^g the conduct uf 
the administration, or the doctrine of the Trinity. It. established a cen- 
sorship of the press on one subject, which might afterwards be extended 
Lo others. 

Martin Van Buren's casting vote would have made this bill a law, but 
for the votes of seven southern senators afterwards given against it. But 
in paying for his sixty-one southern electoral votes, our "democratic" presi 
dent truckled still more to slavery, in threatening to veto any bill which a 
majority of both Houses of Congress might pass, to prohibit the unlimited 
robbery of " the working classes" at the seat of governtrieht. 

Mr. Van Buren's principles are well understood at the south. The Ala-

WOMEN AT WORK IN THE FIELD. 

Mr. Lemuel Sapington, a native of Maryland, formerly a slave-trader, 
now a respectable citizen of Lancaster, Pa., in a letter dated January 21, 
1839, speaking of slaves in the southern part of Virginia, says : — 

" Among the gangs, are often young women, vi'ho bring their children 
to the fields, and lay them in a fence corner, while they are at work. 
When a child is three weeks old, a woman is considered in working order. 
I have seen a woman, with her child strapped to her back, laboring the 
whole day, beside a man, perhaps the father of the child, and he not 
being permitted to give her any assistance, himself being under the whip." 

Rev. Francis Hawley, pastor of the Baptist church, Colebrook, Ct., who 
lived seventeen years in North and South Carolina, says : — 

" Those who are with child are driven to their task till within a few 
days of the time of their delivery ; and when the child is a few weeks old, 
the mother must again go to the field. If it is far from her hut, she must 
take her babe with her. If the child cries, she cannot go to its relief; the 
eye of the overseer is upon her : and if, when she goes to nurse it, she 
stays a little longer than the overseer thinks necessary, he commands her 
back to her task. Brother, you cannot begin to know what the poor slave 
mothers suffer on thousands of plantations at the south." 

Rev. Horace Moulton, of the Methodist Episcopal church, says: — 

" Women are seen bringing their infants into the field to their work, 
and leading others, who are not old enough to stay in the cabins with 
safety. When they get there, they mufct set them down in the dirt and 
go to work. Some, who have very young ones, fix a little sack, and 
place the infants on their back and work. One reason is, the child will 
not cry so much when it can hear a mother's voice. Another is, the 
mothers fear the 'poisonous snakes. I never knew any place where the 
land is so infested with venomous snakes, as in the low lands round about 
Savannah. To secure their infants from poisonous snakes, females often 
work with their infants on their backs." 

" The South-west, by a Yankee," was published by the Harpers, N. Y., 
1835. The writer takes great pains to impress his readers with the beau. 
ties of slavery. Yet he says, (vol. ii. p. 125.) " On most plantations 
females are allowed a month's cessation from 5I|='Field labor befijre and 
after confinement. But it cannot be denied that on some plantations, 
nothing but actual confinement releases them from the field, to which 
the mother soon after returns, leaving an infant a few days old (.' .' .') at 
the " quarters."

after quoting largely from hisletters to slaveholders, says : " From these 
opinions, which are set forth without shadow or coloring, it is seen that 
Mr. Van Buren is perfectly orthodox and democratic in all his views and

'« ON THE SIDE OF THEIR OPPRESSORS WAS POWER." 

A letter from Rev. William Dickey, of Bloomingbarg, Fayette county, 
Ohio, to Rev. John Rankin, of Riplej'^, Ohio, was published 14 years since, 
containing a description of the cutting up of a slave. Tlie perpetrators 
of the deed were two brothers, Lilbuin and Isliani Lewis, nephews to 
Pres. Jefferson. The letter has been scattered all over the country, south 
and north. Hundreds of people around the moutli of Cumberland River 
are personally knowing to these facts. There are the records oi" the court 
that tried the wretches. There are their acquaintances and kindred still 
alive. All over that region of country, the butchery of George is a mat- 
ter of public notoriety. Rev. Wm. Dickey, was for many years a pa«tor 
in Kentucky. He is now an aged and highly esteemed member of the 
Chilicothe Presbytery, Ohio. The following is an extract from his letter : 

" In the county of Livingston, Ky., near the mouth of Cumberland 
River, lived Lilburn Lewis, a sister's son of the celebrated Jefferson. He 
was the wealthy owner of a gang of negroes, who would run away. 
Among the rest was a bay of seventeen, who having just returned from a 
skulking spell, was sent for water, and let fall an elegant pitcher which 
was dashed to shivers. This was made the occasion for reckoning with 
him. It was night — the master had the slaves all collected, and a rous. 
ing fire put on. When the door was secured, he opened to them the de- 
sign of the interview, namely, that they might be effectually advised to 
stay at home and obey his orders. He now called up George, bound him 
with cords, and by the assistance of Isham Lewis, his brother, laid him 
on a broad bench. He then proceeded to hack off George at the ankles ! 
It was with the broad axe ! In vain did the victim scream and roar J 
Casting the feet into the fire, he lectured them at some length. He next 
chopped him off below the knees ! George roaring out and praying his 
master to begin at the other end ! He admonished them again, throwing 
the legs into the fire — then, above the knees, tossing the joints into the fire 
— the next stroke severed the thighs from the body ; these were committed 
to the flames — and bo the arms, head, and trunk, until all was in the fire !" 

We have not room for the rest of the letter ; suffice to say that Lilburn 
Lewis, after being frustrated in a design to kill his wife, lest she might 
testify against him, shot himself before the day appointed for his trial. 
His brother Isham was tried and sentenced to death, but escaped ; went 
to Natchez, married, kept up a correspondence with his friends in Ken. 
tucky, and finally died there a few years since. The Rev. Mr. Dickey 
knew both the men well, and lived near them at the time of the tragedy.

order and proper discipline among our slaves J' In a speech in favor of 
colonization, Mr. Clay said : *' It is far from the intention of this society 
to affect, in any manner, the tenure by which a certain species of property 
IB held," or in plain English, when republicans have their feet upon the 
necks of millions. Colonization says, "why should I care?" With such 
views of the society, Henry Clay is its president. 

When the bill for the admission of Michigan to the Union, was under 
consideration in the United States Senate, Mr. Clay gave a specimen of 
colonization benevolence towards free colored citizens, by making a motion 
to deprive them of the right to vote on the question of its acceptance by 
the people. See Senate Journal. 

3d. His great personal and official influence, when sj>eaker of the U. S 
H. of Rep., secured the admission of Missouri into the Union as a slave state. 

4th. He gave his casting vote, Feb. 1&, 1819, in favor of perpetual sla. 
very in Arkansas, at a time when that territory was almost entirely unin. 
habited, thus struggling for the widest possible extension of legalized crime

SANCTIFIED HATE. LEGALIZED HATE. 

'* In 1835, Anthony Provost, an upright, industrious and sober man, of 
N. Y. city, applied for a license to drive a cart. He was refused because 
he was colored. He worked with his horse and cart a short time, and 
was fined $20 ; but on the application of friends the fine was remitted, 
on payment of costs, and engagement to use his horse and cart no more. 

In 1835, William Hewlett, of N. Y., a well known and respectable co- 
lored man, for whom forty firms, (mostly booksellers) petitioned, was 
likewise refused a carman's license, merely because he was colored. 
"NEGRO SEATS." 

The number of Protestant Churches in the United States is nearly 
TWENTY THOUSAND, with more than a million and a half of communi- 
cants. Some of these churches, doubtless, have no "negro scat," because 
they have no people of color to thrust into them. But it is notorious | 
that almost every church has one, if persons of color are in the habit of 
attending upon its worship. That such persons are to occupy those 
seats and no others, is not merely expected but required — they have no op- 
tion — " sit here or budge," is the spirit of the law, however its executive 
may phrase it, in carrying it out. Now this setting apart of an exclusive 
seat for colored persons, is an expression of feeling toward them, "What 
kind of feeling is it ? It must be either rcsjjec^, or its opposite, ov neither. 
That it is respect for them, none claim — and to say that it is neither re- 
spect nor its opposite, but a feeling of entire indifference, is absurd, for if 
they have no feelings towards colored persons why such strong feelings 
about their seats ? Why single out certain seats for them and make them 
sit in them ? Every body knows that the feeling toward colored persons, 
expressed by the " negro seat," is dislike, aversion, contempt — and why ? 
because they are what God made them. That hue and those features which 
the churches thus publicly deride and blasphemously criticise and scout, 
by compelling all who have them to sit apart — because they have them — 
God approves — ^they are his own hand-writing upon their forms — pro- 
nounced by himself " very good" — and to convert them into a badge of 
degradation, is monstrous impiety. Every church that has a " ne- 
gro seat," keeps posted upon its walls a standing criticism upon God's 
workmanship, a public proclamation of their contempt for it. Every 
such church is carrying on a public qiiarrel with its professed Hevd; 

d in the language of scripture we say to its minister, its ofiicers, its mem- 
bers — "Be ye reconciled to God." '^ If ye have respect to persons ye 
COMMIT SIN." " Put away from among you the accursed thing."

District of Columbia, or in "any territory of the United States," and intro- 
Juced resolutions into the U. S. Senate, denouncing "the interference of

IN THAT STATE. Gso. W. Weissenger, who is associate editor of the Louis-

"LAWLESS" BURNING OF MEN "BY THE MANY." 

April 23, 183(), in St. Louis, Mo., a black man named Mcintosh, who 
had stabbed an officer, that had arrested him, was .seized by the multitude, 
and fastened to a tree in the midst of the city, m the open day, and in 
the presence of an immense throng of citizens, was burnt to death. 
The Alton (111.) Telegraph, in its account of the scene says : 

"All was silent while they v,'erc piling wood around their victim ; when 
the flames seized upon him he uttered an awful howl, attempted to sing 
and pray, and then hung his head and suffered in silence, except in the 
following instance : — After the flames had surrounded their prey, his 
eyes burnt out of his head, and his mouth seemingly parched to a cinder, 
some one in the crowd, proposed to put an end to his misery by shooting 
him, when it was replied, 'that would be of no use, since he was already 
out of pain,* • No, no,' said the wretch, I am suffering as much as ever ; 
shoot me, shoot me.' ' No, no,' said one, 'he shall net be shot. / ivould 
sooner slacken the fire, if that would increase his miscnj /' and the man 
who said this was, as we understand, an officer of justice." 

The St. Ix)uis correspondent of a New York paper adds: — ''The 
shrieks and groans of the victim were loud and piercing, and to observe 
one limb after another drop into the fire was awful indeed. I visited the 
place this morning ; only a part of his head and body were left." 

Hon. Luke E. Lawless, Judge, of the Circuit Court of Missouri, at its 
session, in St. Louis, some months after, decided that since the burning of 
Mcintosh was the act, directly or by countenance, of a majority of citi- 
zens, it is a ' case which transcends the jurisdiction,' of the Grand Jury! 

The ' New Orleans Post,' of June 7, 1836, publishes the following : — 

" We understand, that a negro man was lately condemned, by the 
mob, to be burned over a slow fire, which was put into execution at 
Grand Gulf, Mississippi, for murdering a black woman and her master." 

" Tuscaloosa, Ala., June 20, 1827. — Last week a Mr. M'Neilly charged 
a slave with theft. M'Neilly, and his brother, seized him, and were about 
to chastise him, when the negro stabbed M'Neilly. The negro was taken 
before a justice, who waiv^ his authority. A crowd collected, and he 
acted as president of the mob, and put the vote, when it was decided he 
should be immediately barnt to death '-^ He was led to the tree, 
a large quantity of pine knots placed around him, the fatal torch applied 
to the pile, and the miserable being was in a short time burned to ashes. 
This is the S ECOND negro who has been THUS put to death, without 
judge or Jury, in this county." — African Observer, for August, 1827.

III. William Henry Harrison. In December, 1802, while Governor of 
Indiana Territory, he was president of a convention of the people of that 
territory, held at Vinceinles, and transmitted to congress a memorial of: 
the convention, praying that the sixth article of the " Ordinance of '87. 
which prohibited slavery there, might be s-uspended. (See Am. State pa-' 
pars, 1803.) His efforts to make Indiana a slave state were prosecuted for 
years while he was Governor of that terl-itory, [ 

In 1819, on a question v/hich was to decide whether slavery should be 
forever legalized on 200,000 square miles of purchased territory, including 
Missouri, Arkansas, and the territory west of it, he seized every opportu-| 
nity to vote fox this complicated villany." See seven of his votes an ih'is] 
subject recorded in the Almanac of last year. So basely did he bow to, 
slavery, that even Ohio was shocked. He was indignantly rejected at 
the next congressional election in 1822. The National Intelligencer of 
Oct. 20, 1822, says : " It is confirmed to us, that Mr. Gazley is elected in| 
opposition to General Harrison. A friend informs us, v^hich we are sorry

to learn, that he was opposed particularly on account of his adherence to 
that princ iple of the Constitution which secures to the people of the south 
their pre-existing rights." It seems, then, that General Harrison claimed 
for the south, the right to fasten slavery upon any soil which the nation 
might have or purchase. 

He has had but little opportunity to act in a public capacity upon the 
subject of slavery, since that time ; but an address from his political friends 
in Virginia, in 1836, says, " he is sound to the core on the subject of 
slavery." 

WHAT HAS THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH TO DO WITH SLAVERY ? 

Hear the testimony of Rev. H. G. Ludlow, of New Haven, Ct., given 
by him, Jan. 16, 1837, when pastor of the Spring street Presbyterian 
Church, New York. " Rev. Dr. Skinner told me that Rev. Dr. Wither-j 
spoon, of South Carolina, Moderator of the last General Assembly, told 
him, last spring, that Rev. Samuel Hatch, (a Presbyterian Clergyman,) 
had made $25,000 by his cotton last year, and intended to lay out! 
$90,000 FOR SLAVES and land this year."

" OLD KENTUCK '' SETTING ON HIS DOGS. 

May 1, 1839, a law went into effect in Ohio, for the seizure of '* fugitives 
from labor or service from other states." It authorises any ji^dge of a 
court of record, (selected by the enslaver, and if need be with all privacy,) 
to £rive a decision enslaving the person claimed and all liis posterity. 

The person arrested can have the trial postponed but 60 days, and then 
only by giving bonds for «*$I000, and filing an affidavit (hat he or she is 
free, and '' verily believes" it can be proved — while the slaveholder or his 
agent can have it postponed, on his own oath, without bonds. 

It imposes a fine of .^500, or imprisonment for 60 days, on any person 
who shall — 1, Counsel or advise a slave to escape ; 2, Furnish money or 
conveyance of any kind, or " any other facility ;" 3, Harbor or conceal 
any such person ; 4, " Obstruct or hinder" a constable in seizing a slave. 

Tliis lav/, which makes it a crime to feed the hungrv, clothe the naked, 
or even give shelter to a sick stranger, Ohio has passed at the bidding of 
Kentucky. Of all the crawling serviles that drag their bellies along the 
tracks of slaveholders, and lick their feet in return for kicks and stamp- 
ings, none do it with a more greedy relish than Ohio lawmakers. 

It takes a despot, a craven, and a slave, compounded together, to make 
a pro-slavery legislator in a/rce state. The last legislature of Ohio had | 
a majority of just such creatures. Noses of wax ! stay pinched, just as 
the slaveholder's thumb and finger left you. Dough-faces ! wear the 
prints of your masters' knuckles, and the traces of their spittle. They 
are your coats of arms, and they Jit ye — your titles of nobility, and theyHl 
stick to ye. Snow water and, soap won't wash them off, nor your hot I 
tears either — nor fire burn them out, nor paint hide them, nor plasters i 
cover them. You have worked hard for infamy, and you liave got it. j 
It will live with you, and live after you — a warning to all other serviles, j 
who sell their own and their constituents' birthright for an immortality of i 
scorn. And so you had a great rejoicing at Columbus, after you had tram- 1 
pled over constitutions, to kiss the toe of Kentucky, and thrust under her I 
hoof the necks of your constituents. Well I kindle your bonfires, and 
dance while you may — but know ye, you burn up your own charters, and 
dance to the music of your own chains and collars. Like Milton's 
devils, you opened your mouths on apples, but youHl shut them on ashes. 

Freemen of Ohio, let these ignobles know, at the ballot-box, that their 
constituents are men, and will see to it, that they are not again represent- 
ed by ^'^ creeping things." Saj' to them, ''Go, fawn and crawl on slave- 
holders, if you will, but leave none of your slime on us." [See next page. 



1840.] DECEMBER— TWELFTH MONTH. [31 days' 



But Ohio is not alone. Indiana has got the start of her in this scrub- 
race for infamy, as the following extract from the message of Gov. Noble 
on retiring fi-om office, Dec. 7, 1837, fully shows. 

Our laws protect the interests and rights of the citizens of those states 
where slavery has been established, and furnish all just facihties for 
the recla?nation of thdit species of property. By the act of 1824, provision 
was made for arrest and hearing, in a most sdmmary manner. Our judicial 
tribunals are ever ready to enforce the law, and a full measure of damages 
is awarded. Our laws impose a fine not exceeding ^500 on any one who 
shallknowingly employ a slave, conceal him, or encourage his escape. 

Illinois, more servile than either Ohio or Indiana, catches a man with 
out waiting for Kentucky's orders. In 1837, James L. Simpson, sheriff, 
advertised m an Illinois paper, that he had seized and put in jail, a colored 
' man, named Franklin White, and adds : " The owner of said negro, if 
any there should he, is requested to call and make proof of such owner- 
ship." — Dated at Hennepin, July 27, 1S37.

" THEY CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES." 

'» If the slaves were emancipated they could'nt take care of themselves." 
The din of this objection rings in everybody's ears. What will become 
of the helpless creatures if their masters stop robbing them ? Verily 
they'll come to poverty, and that will break their masters' hearts! Slave- 
holders hold their slaves out of sheer pity, to keep them from starving 
and freezing ; and slavery, like hospitals, alms-houses, poor-houses, and 
asylums, is a benevolent institution for taking care of (hose who " can't 
take care of themselves," The latter are old fashioned contrivances, and 
have been tolerated quite too long. Enlightened humanity has now start- 
ed slavery as an opposition line, and b'.ds fair to take all the custom. 
The high clip.rges, scanty fare, miserable attendance and few comforts of 
the " old line" entitle the disinterested proprietors of the " opposition''' to 
universal patronage. When a poor sailor breaks his leg, make him a slave 
if you want to take care of him ; it is cruel to send him to a hospital. 
When your neighbor's last bed has gone off under the hammer, and he is 
turned out of doors, to have him " taken care of" in a poor-house is bar- 
barism. Make a slave of him, rob him of all his rights, and he is provided 
for I When a good-for-nothing husband runs away and leaves a wife and 
eight children who " can't take care of themselves," duty is plain ; drive 
them into your yard, put your mark on them, and make them your " pro- 
perty." So with all idiots, the blind, the deaf and dumb, the insane, and 
all other descriptions of persons who "can't take care of themselves." 
To send them to asylums and alms-houses is all behind the age ; we show 
yon a more excellent way ; turn them into property, set them on the auction 
table, knock them off to the highest bidder, make out a bill of sale for 
each — and overseers and drh^ers will see that they are taken care of I 

' Can't take care of themselves." Who cultivated the fifteen hun- 
dred THOUSAND bales of cotton, that were exported from the United 
States last year, besides the. immense quantities manufactured in this 
country ? Who cultivate all the rice, indigo and tobacco ? Who raise 
all the southern corn, wheat and sweet potatoes ? Who cultivate all the 
sugar cane of the south-west, and manufacture the sugar and molasses ? 
This is all done by these helpless imbeciles who " can't take care of them, 
selves." Who are the men at the south that hold the plough, and wield 
the hoe, and swing the axe, and scythe, and sickle, and flail, and hill 
hook, and sledgehammer? Who thrust the spade and delve with rhe 
crow bar, and trundle the barrow? who drive the plane, and push the saw, 
and turn the auger, and blow the bellows, and strike the anvil ? who are

the teamsters, draymen, porters, hod-carriers, plaisterers and whitewash- 
ers, colt.breakers and trainers, and drovers, road-makers, canal-diggers, 
street-cleaners and pavers, butchers, bakers, fishermen, boatmen, firemen 
and stewards, water carriers, cooks and waiters, seamstresses, chamber- 
maids, nurses, washers and ironers ? Oh they are these same help, 
less idiots with their tongues out and hands dangling, that " can't 
take care of themselves." Very true they do all the Avork at the South, 
and their fathers and mothers did it before them ; they began to work as 
soon as they were big enough to pick up chips, tote a'gourd to the spring 
or shake a fly-brush ; and they have been working ever since, and have 
done nothing hut work ; work has knit their joints, strung up their sinews, 
spread and hardened their muscles and brawn ; work has become a fixed 
habit, and habit has made work easy, and practice has taught the best 
methods, and given them skill and facility ; but, poor creatures, " they can't 
take care of themselves." Now, reader, look at the puny masters and mis- 
tresses, who are in such hysteric spasms at the helplessness of their slaves, 
and at the necessity of flogging and robbing tjiem to keep them from com- 
ing to want. They never did a day's work in their lives, and are totally 
ignorant of all kinds of labor ; would wilt down in fifteen minutes if at 
work in the sun, and tire out in less time. Look at their little soft hands, 
taper fingers, thin skins, loose joints, and flabby muscles. Look at them 
lolling along the plantation walks, holding up an umbrella wil hone hand 
and wagging a feather fan with the other, and squeaking out in girlish 
treble as they squint through their eye glasses at their brawny slaves, who 
are grubbing up the sod — '■' they carCt take care of themselves,"'' '■'^ they can't take 
care of theviselves."' 

Ship off a colony of these masters and mistresses to the everglades of 
Florida, or to Crusoe's island, and ship off^ a colony of their slaves at the 
same time, settle them in separate districts, and leave both parties to ''take 
care of themselves." At a year's end go and see how the} get along ; see 
how many acres each party has grubbed up, what crops they have raised ; 
see which has lost the most flesh, has the largest sick list, and the most 
graves. Find out how many of each party gave up at once disheartened, 
how many ran crazy, how many committed suicide, how many fainted in 
the field, how many sunk down in despair, and with bleeding feet and 
blistered hands, and muscles swollen till motion was torture, sat still 
and starved. Such an experiment would soon show which could take 
the best care of themselves, when forced either to starve or get a living 
by their own sweat — the masters and mistresses who never took care of 
themselves, never earned a dollar by manual labor, and are ignorant as 
babies of the use of tools and of all kinds of work, or the slaves who have 
always taken care of themselves and of their masters and mistresses be- 
sides, have always been used to work, accustomed to hardships, handy in 
the use of all working implements, and able to thrive on food that the 
pampered stomachs of their masters and mistresses would nauseate. 
That the reader may judge of the pains and expense that masters are at 
in providing for their slaves, we insert the following — 

SPECIMEN OF THE CARE WHICH SLAVEHOLDERS TAKE OF THEIR SLAVES. 

To put it beyond a doubt that this objection of slaveholders springs 
from pure compassion for the slaves, we insert a specimen of the amount 
of care which they take of ihem. 

The legal allowance of food for slaves in North Carolina, is, in the words 
of the law, "a quart of corn per day." — See Haywood's Manual, 525, 
The legal allowance in Louisiana is more, a barrel [flour barrel] of corn, 
[in the ear,] or its equivalent in other grain, and a pint of salt a month. In 



|!l840.] 



Anti. Slavery Almanac. 31 



the other sla\ e slates the amount of food for the slaves is left to the option 
of the master. 

Thomas Clay, Esq., of Georgia, a slaveholder, in his address before the 
Georgia Presbytery, 1833, spealiing of the food of slaves says, " the 
j quantity allowed by custom is a peck of corn a week.^' 

W. C. Gildersleeve, Esq., a native of Georgia, and elder in the Pres- 
byterian Church, Wilitcsbarre, Pennsylvania, says, " The weekly allow- 
ance to grown slaves on the plantations where 1 was best acquainted was 
a peck of corn a week." 

William Ladd, Esq., of Minot, Maine, late president of the American 
I Peace Society, and once a slaveholder in Florida, says, 

" The usual allowance of food was one quart of corn a day to a full 
task hand, with a modicum of salt ; kind masters allowed a peck of corn 
a v)eek ; some masters allowed no sail." 

The legal allowance of clothing to slaves in Louisiana for one half the 
year is '■'■ one shirt and one pair of pantaloons." See Law of Louisiana. 
Martin's Digest, 610. 

Now if the slaveholders, when they tell us that the slaves can't take care ol 
themselves, mean that the}' cbn't take so good care of themselves as they\ 
take of them, we need be at no loss, for the above laws of slave states and] 
testimonies, settle what that care is, and serve to interpret the objection into 
plain English as follows, " The slaves, if emancipated, can't get for them- 
selves a peck of corn a week and one shirt and one pair of pantaloons in 
six months, therefore, to save them from nakedness and starvation, we 
will consent to keep them at work for us, and in return lavish on them all 
the comforts and luxuries aforesaid 1" 

Further — slaveholders themselves are constantly refuting this objection 
by their action#und words. One can hardly take up a southern newspa- 
per without finding proof of this in every column. We have now on our 
table scores of advertisements in southern papers, in which slaves offered 
for sale are advertised as follows: — 'likely,' 'very likely,' 'active,' 
' industrious,' 'smart,' * very shrewd,' ' capable,' ' intelligent,' ' faithful,' 
' honest,' ' steady,' ' sober,' ' careful,' ' very religious,' ' a first rate cook,' ' a 
fine seamstress,' ' an excellent washer and ironer,' ' a prime field hand,' ' a 
very good blacksmith,' &,c. &c. Hundreds of such advertisements may 
be gathered from southern papers every week. What nonsense to say 
that such persons can't take care of themselves. 

The laws of slave states show plainly that slaveholders well know 
the ability of the great body of their slaves to '' take care of them- 
selves." The fact that those states which permit emancipation, prohibit the 
emancipation of the very young, the aged and the diseased, is their testi- 
mony that all who are neither very young, nor old, nor of unsound con- 
stitutions — can " take care of themselves," So those laws of slave states 
that load the free blacks with such numerous burdens and disabilities 
iTom which the whites are exempt — show the conviction of slaveholders 
that they will take such good care of themselves, that the great 
contrast between their condition and that of the slaves will fill the latter 
with discontent; therefore their ingenuity is taxed to the utmost to crip- 
ple and crush the free blacks in every way possible, and thus make it as 
difficult as they can for them to '' take care of themselves." 

Finally. — This objection, that the slaves, if emancipated, could not 
take care of themselves, is as impious as it is ridiculous. To say that 
any class of persons in this country, in possession of their reason, not 
crippled in their bodily powers, and under the protection of law, " can't 
take care of themselves," is not only a slander upon human nature but 



32 Anti-Slavery Almanac. [1840. 



upon the Creator. What 1 human beings unable to take ca-e of them, 
selves ! Mere animal instinct is all sufficient for that. Why don't you 
make slaves of ants and bees, squirrels and swallows, lobsters and pick- 
erel, to keep the poor things from coming to want ? We repeat it, even 
brate instinct is all sufficient to prompt, and brute sagacity sufficient to 
devise ways and means and to provide a supply for its own wants. To 
Asny that the self-preserving promptings of human nature and the re- 
sources of human sagacity are inferior to those of the lowest grade of 
brutes is not less blasphemous than absurd. 

Had we space we might furnish hundreds of testimonies furnished by 
slaveholders themselves, to the disposition and abundant ability of the 
slaves to " take care of themselves." We subjoin only tiie following. 

In an article on slavery, published in the New York Knickerbocker, under 
date of Oct. 27, 1837, is the following, written at the South, and in the true 
spirit of a slavedriver: — " Whatever they (the slaves) raise in their own 
time they realize the avails of. I have known instances where they chiefly 
supplied the table of their masters with chickens, eggs or fish, for which they 
received pay, or, as they sometimes preferred bartering, sugar or molasses. 
* * * The gay handkerchiefs and fine calico dresses, in which the 
females always appear on the Sabbath, zxe purchased with the proceeds of\ 
their extra labor. I have frequently been awakened on Tnoonlight nights , 
with the songs of negroes approaching our settlement to trade, with a writ I 
ten permit from their masters. They come in boats from a distance of 
thirty or forty miles, and if they return in time to commence their accus- 
tomed (Monday) morning labor all is well," 

That the above testimony to the capacity and inclination of the slaves 
to " take care of themselves," does not spring from any blind " fanatic" 
partialities towards them, is plain from the following declaration of the 
writer in another part of the article. '' That they are less intelligent and 
more brutish than many of the inferior animals, is a lamentable fact." 

The following is an extract of a letter from Commodore Patterson, to 
the Secretary of the Navy, dated August 15, 1816. Speaking of " three 
hundred" runaway slaves, collected in an encampment in Okefanoke 
Swamp, in Florida, the Commodore says: — "Their forces were daily in- 
creasing, and they felt themselves so strong and secure that they had 
COMMENCED SEVERAL PLANTATIONS on the fertile banks of the Apalachicola, 
which would have yielded them every article op sustenance, and which 
would consequently, in a short time, have rendered their establishment 
quite formidaUe, and highly injurious to the neighboring states. — (See 
American State Papers, 'Jd session, 15th Congress. Vol vi. No. 119 p. 12.)

SMALL CAPITALS, Conservatives. Their term of office ends March 3, 1841. The figures at the

STATISTICS. 

The above table shows where slaveiy had taken root in 1790 ; the table 
on the fifth page gives a comprehensive view of the statistics cf^ slavery 
since. The column headed " /. to s. m.," shows the whole number of 
inhabitants to a square mile. The columns headed 1839, contrast the 
present apportionment of representatives with what it would be, if the 
present number were apportioned on the basis of the free population 
only ; by which we m.ay see how large a part of our own just rights in 
the United States House of RepresentatWtJS we have given to slavery. 

The estimate for 1840, was form-<' ^J careful mathematical calculation. 
It probably gives too lars"^ * ^ee population in the slave states, and too 
small in the free st-3*^-

"IT WOULD BE UNSAFE, TO SET THE SLAVES FREE." 
This objection wears a false face. Those who bring it forward, al- 
ways find it convenient to stop in the middle, leaving it half stated, con- 
sequently, as it is, it is a mere catch-word. Fairly stated, it would run 
thus, " To set the slaves free and protect their rights, would be more dan. 
gerous than to keep them robbed of their rights and of legal protection." 
This question is a very plain one, if any one finds his brains puzzled in 
settling it, he may rely upon it, that it is Zi i'mseZ/ that puzzles them and 
not the question. Let us put a few questions to the reader's common 
sense. Which is the safest, to let men have what belongs to them, or 
to cheat them out of it ? to let them work for their own benefit, or 
force them to Work for you without wages and flog them if they refuse ? 
to let them live where thay think they can do best, or force them to live 
where you wish to have them ? to leave them to choose their own labor, 
or to choose for them and whip them to it ? to let them be their own 
judges as to their food, or to screw them down to a fixed allowance ? to 
let them regulate their meals, rest, sleep, social intercourse and worship, 
or to take upon yourself the sole regulation of the whole— force them in 
all these respects to do as you please, and cufF, cane, and flog them if 
they resist your will ? to let them marry whom and when they desire to, 
or to make such matches for them as you please, and break them when 
you please ? to let them live with their wives and children, or to tear 
them forever from their sight ? to let them own and use their own hands 
and feet, and muscles and bones, and eyes and ears, their bodies and 
minds, their liberty, time, and wages, according to their own judgment, 
and for theii' own benefit, or violently to wrest from them the ownership 
and use of all these, and monopolize them for yourself ? 

There is but one answer to all these questions, and that so plain, that 
he who would gravely put them, and insist upon a formal answer, 
would be tittered at for a simpleton the world over. 

REVliXGE FOR FAVORS. 

"Oh, but the slaves would revenue iliemselves on their masters if they 
were set free." Revenge themselves for what ? favors and kindness, or 
injuries 1 The objection not only admits, but affirms, that to hold men as 
slaves wrongs them ; consequently the slaves hate their masters, therefore 
if their masters set them free they will hate them the more ! Since hold- 
ing them makes them angry, letting them go would put them in a per- 
fect fury — since slavery goads men to revenge, take away the goad and 
they are strung up to phrenzy I Since all the bad past^ions are provoked 
by slavery, therefore keep up the provocation, if you stop it, they will rage 
like the sea in a stofm ! According to the Bible, oppression makcth a 
man mad ; but according to the objector, stop oppressing him and you 
make him madder ! That inflicting wrongs upon a person is calculated 
to exasperate him against the inflictor, every one knows ; and that the 
way to soothe his exasperation, make him forget his wrong's, and fill 
him with kind feelings towards you, is at once to stop the infliction, re- 
store his plundered rights and protect him, is a principle of human nature 
just as well known as the other. God who made the mind, and who best 
knows what will most powerfully excite and pacify its rage, has given us 
the following prescription for taking out the inflammation from an ex- 
asperated mind — " Yielding pacifieth great off*ences." — Eccl. x, 4. 
" Yielding," not persisting in the perpetration of thenj, but " Yielding." 
The objection admits that holding men as slaves, is a " great offence" to 
them, by alleging that it is calculated to provoke them to revenge. Now 
which is the best Avay to ' pacify" this " great offence," by continuing to 



38 Anti- Slavery Almanac. [lb40 . 

perpetrate it, or by yielding the point, ceasing from the wrong, giving to 
the wronged man his own, and protecting and treating him thencefor- 
ward in every respect as a man and a brotlier ? In the passage cited 
above, Gou has settled this question. Let him who attempts to settle it 
any other way, beware lest haply he be found fighting against God. 
Since robbing a man of his liberty and earnings, makes him your 
enemy, the first step to be taken in making him your friend, is to stop 
doing that which made him your enemy. The Bible gives this common- 
sense direction to all who wish to make others their friends ; '• A man 
that hath [would have] friends, must show himself friendly ." So long as 
the slaveholder robs his slave of his liberty, earnings, and all his rights, 
he makes him his enemy and provokes him to revenge ; now if he would 
make him his friend^ let him do what the Bible and comraon-sense bid 
him — " SHOW HIMSELF friendly" — give back to him his liberty, and time, 
and rights of conscience, and the ownership of his own body ; give back 
to him his wife and children, pay him wages for his labor, protect him in 
all his rights, instead of snatching them away from him, and in all his 
dealings with him, " show himself frikndly." Let slaveholders do this 
and if they don't find it the safest course they can pursue, then tlie Bible 
is a fable and common-sense a fool. 

whipping and spurring break check-reins. 
Further, the slaves are now peaceable, though goaded by innumerable 
wrongs. The community can easily restrain them now, while lashing 
them with one hand and holding the check-rein with the other, will they 
be unable to restrain them when they throw down the lash, pay wages, 
give them equal laws, and have both hands to manage the check-rein ? 
Ridiculous ! If the slaves have sense enough to eee that on the whole it 
is best for them not to rebel against laws which grind them into the dust, 
will they be such fools as to rebel against laws which set them on their feet ? 

PAST WRONGS OVERMATCHED BY PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE. 

But, says the objector, the slaves if set free, will revenge themselves on 
their masters for their past wrongs. Answer, if they arc not set free, the 
same past wrongs will goad them to revenge, and besides these, the goad- 
ing of present wrongs and the certainty of future wrongs will strike into 
the heart far keener and more corroding stings. If set free, all that can 
excite revenge, is the mere memory of wrongs that have ceased — if still 
held as slaves, wrongs past, present, and to come, all strike their stings 
at once into the soul. If set free, two of these, the most fiery and en. 
venomed, are drawn out, and the other, the memory of wrongs rankles 
no longer ; for the wrongs have ceased, and kindness, justice, and protec- 
tion have taken their places, and gratitude and joy pour oblivion over 
wrongs that exist no longer. Present kindness is a sacrifice of a sweet- 
smelling savor upon the altar of past wrongs, a peace-offering hushing 
every clamor for revenge. Since the slaves, while cheated out of their 
rights, do not take vengeance on their masters for it, what nonsense to 
argue that when their masters have given them their rights, they would 
take vengeance on them because they did not give them sooner ! That 
I slavery is perilous to the masters, the whole world knows. Slaves are 
! always struggling to get their liberty ; when that is given to them what 
I have they got to fight for ? Will they struggle to get liberty and then 
fight because they have got it ? 

TO hold men slaves more dangerous than to set THEM FREE. 

I We have already shown that to rob men of rights, tempts them to 
I fight for them, and to reven ge them sel ves on those who rob them, and 



1840.J Anti-Slavery Almanac. 39 



that to give them their rights, and treat them with kindness, leaves them 
nothing to fight for, and takes away all motives to revenge ; to this we 
add, that it would he for the interest of emancipated slaves to be peace- 
able. While slaves, they have little to lose by rebellion and nothing to 
gain by being peaceable ; when free, they have everything to gain by 
keeping the peace, and everything to lose by breaking it. While slaves, 
their only chance for freedom is to figlit for it ; but if they fight after be- 
ing set free, they do it at the risk of their freedom, and with an almost 
absolute certainty of losing it. While slaves, they must either be robbed 
of their earnings or fight for them ; when free, they already have their 
earnings ; if they fight, they lose them. While slaves, they have every 
motive to desire the overturning of society, as they have nothing to lose 
by it, and might be great gainers ; when free, they have every induce, 
mcnt to deprecate such a convulsion, and to do their utmost to prevent 
it, for they are now a part of society, and whatever jostles it jostles them. 
While slaves, they have every motive to deplore and retard, if they can, 
the prosperity of the country ; for whatever contributes to its prosperity, 
increases their burdens ; but when free, all these motives are reversed^ — 
whatever promotes the prosperity of the country, promotes their interests, 
and they have every inducement to contribute to its strength and good 
order. Besides, the same laws which restrain others from injuring /Ac?/i, I 
will restram them from injuring others. 

SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY NATURAL TO SLAVES. ! 

Their habit of quietly submitting to authority, especially to a capri- , 
cious and unjust one, while slaves, has produced in them a state of j 
mind which makes submisssion to just laws natural and easy, strongly j 
predisposing them to obedience, and unfitting them for violent resistance ",1 
so, having always been kept at hard labor, on low and scanty diet, and 
generally without sufficient sleep, they have no hot blood, nor the stimu- 
lation of full physical habits, urging them to personal conflicts. Not only 
have all their pursuits predisposed them to industry and peace, and unfit- 
ted them for war, but as they have no knowledge of the art. and no train- 
ing, they lack every requisite and all means for its prosecution, and it 
would be impossible for the present generation to possess themselves of 
these, even if they were plied with motives to rebel against the govern- 
ment. But, as we have already shown, all the motives which could ope- 
rate upon them, would kresistibly persuade them to be peaceable. 

THE AFRICAN CHARACTER PROVEREIALLY MILD AND FORBEARING. 

The reasons stated above would operate powerfully upon persons of all 
characters, and classes, and nations. All men placed in such circum- 
stances as would surround the slaves of this country, if emancipated, 
would be peaceable. But the African character is proverbially and pre 
eminently mild, patient, and peaceful ; the fact that such a multitude of 
Africans have been and are slaves, in different parts of the world, is evi- j 
i dence sufficient. When Avarice first circled over the earth in search oi i 
victims, why did she stoop upon the African, rather than the fierce Ma. 
lay, or the wild Tartar ; the headlong Saracen, or the fiery Gaul ? Why j 
did she not strike her talons into them, and drag them away to whips, 
and chains, and unpaid toil ? Why was the African singled out from 
every other kindred, and tongue, and people ? We answer, because he 
could be made a slave more easily, and held as a slave more easily ; hi? 
gentle, patient nature ill-adapted him to fierce conflicts, and predisposed 
I him to industry, quiet, and forbearance under injury. How strikingly 
I this is exemplified in the history of African slavery ! \Vhat other people 



40 A?iti. Slavery Almanac. [1340. 



would have borne so unresistingly such unutterable wrongs and anguish ! 
What other people would not have rushed in frenzy upon thek tormentors, 
and forced their way through fire and carnage, to liberty or extinction ! 

The peculiar mildness of the African character is estabhshed by the 
testimony of a host of witnesses, who have travelled and resided in all 
parts of that continent. A volume might be filled with extracts from 
their works, testifying to the gentle and peaceful dispositions of the in- 
habitants. If the reader has access to any of the following works, he 
will find them full of facts and testimony to this point, ♦' Mungo Park's 
Travels," " Smith's Guinea," " Golberry's Travels in Africa," " Moore's 
African Travels," " Wadstrom on Colonization," " Welsh's Voyage to 
Benin," " Atkin's Voyage to Guinea," '* Stibb's Voyages," (for the last 
three see " Astley's Voyages.") The reader is also referred to a mass of 
evidence, corroborating this position, taken before the British H. of Com^ 
mons, when the slave trade was under discussion, half a century since. 

The following is from " Travels in Louisiana," translated from the 
French, by John Davis, p. 86. " Negroes are a species of beings whom na- 
ture seems to have intended for slavery — their pliancy of temper, patience 
under injury, and innate passiveness, all concur to justify this poj-ition." 

The absurd and blasphemous inference drawn from their mildness and 
forbearance, does not weaken the force of this testimony. 

Mr. Wood, a slaveholder, (see his speech before the Va. legis., Jan. 23, 
1832, in Richmond Whig,) said of the slaves, "They are a peaceful peo- 
ple ; they are faithful to their masters ; they are obedient and tractable." 

In conclusion, we furnish the reader with the following scripture testi- 
mony to the peaceableness of the African character. He will find it in 
1st Chron. 4 : 40. " And the land was wide, and quiet, and feacea- 
BLE» for they of Ham had dwelt there of old." 

PROPHECY RUNNING A TILT AT HISTORY. 

Why all this shuddering at the " dangers of emancipation ?" Why 
don't these ghostly shriekers, who croak *' blood !" " blood !" show us some 
blood ? Come, gentlemen, you have dosed us long enough with your 
theory — now search over the world, and through all time, and find one 
practical illustration of it, if you can. You have shown oiF your poetry, 
now deal in plain prose — such oracles in prophecy, can hardly be dolts in 
history. We wait for the facts. How do you know that emancipation 
would be unsafe ? Knowledge is the result of observation and experi- 
ence. Whose observation or experience testifies to the danger of eman- 
cipation ? Whose blood has been shed, whose house has been burned, 
whose flocks and herds have been destroyed, whose fields have been de- 
vastated, because he paid his laborers their hire ? Give us the names, 
and places, and times, and manner, and tell us where they are chronicled. 
Slaves have been emancipated in all parts of the world, and in almost all 
ages ; they have been emancipated in large bodies and small bodies, in 
times of war and peace, by their masters and by governments, by law, 
and by common consent without law, and, in fine, in every variety of 
surrounding circumstances ; but never have they risen upon their eman- 
cipators — the scroll of emancipation has never been stained with the 
blood of a single master who has emancipated his slaves. 

Within the last forty-five years millions of slaves have been emanci- 
pated, besides those set free in the United States in that period. In 1794 
more than six hundred thousand slaves were emancipated by the French 
government in their colonies. Large bodies of slaves have been eman- 
cipated in the following places. In Java in 1811 ; in Ceylon in 1815 ; in 
Buenos Ayres 1816 ; in St. Helena 1819 ; in Colombia and Chili 1821 ; in 



1840.] Anti. Slavery Almanac. 41 



Cape Colony 1823; in Malacca 1825 ; in Southern Birmah 1826; in Bo. 
livia 1826 ; in Peru, Monte Video and Guatimala 1828 ; in Mexico 1829, 
and besides these, eight hundred thousand slaves were emancipated in the 
British West India Islands, at the Mauritius, at the Cape of Good Hope, 
in Demerara, in Berbice, Esscquibo, and Honduras in 1834. All these 
emancipations, with their circumstances and results, are matter of history. 
All of them were pre-eminently safe to the masters who emancipated, 
and to the communities in which slavery was abolished. No throats were 
cut, no assaults committed, nor incendiary torches kindled in consequence 
of the emancipation of these millions of slaves. We defy the advocates 
of slavery to produce a single instance in the history of the world in 
which emancipated slaves have ever risen upon their former masters, un- 
less those masters attempted to i-educe them again to slavery. 

•' HORRORS OF ST, DOJIINGO." 

Does the reader cry out '' Horrors of St. Domingo ?' We are loth to think 
so meanly either of his intelligence or common honesty as to suppose that 
he will ring the changes upon that old, shamed and silenced catchword. 
Time was when that smooth counterfeit might pass in corners for honest 
coin, but for years it has stuck to the counter as snugly as though it grew 
there. It has been proved by every authentic history of the " Horrors of 
St. Domingo," that they were horrors produced by withholding liberty 
from the slaves, and by attempting to reduce /ree men to slavery, and 
that not one of them was in consequence of emancipating the slaves, 
Everyone not grossly ignorant of the facts in the St. Domingo tragedies, 
knows that all the blood shed there by the blacks, was shed either while 
they were yet slaves and struggling for liberty, (thus showing the danger of 
depriving them of it,) or after they had most peaceably enjoyed their li- 
berty without abusing it for nearly ten years, when Bonaparte sent an 
army to reduce them again to slavery. Then they fought and conquered 
and from the weltering plains and smoking ruins, and streets and rivers 
choked with corpses, blood mingled wilh fire reeked up to heaven, a great 
cloud of witnesses testifying to the " horrors" of holding men in bondage 
and the *' horrors" of reducing free men to slavery. Reader, these, and 
these only, were the " Horrors of St. Domingo." 

Finally — look at the score of British Islands and colonies, almost at 
our own doors — in the West Indies and on the coast of South America — 
where more than half a million slaves were emancipated in 1837, and 
where these emancipated slaves have been from that time till now the 
peaceable and orderly subjects of law — and that, too, though the average 
proportion of blacks to whites is more than ten to one. 



SLAVES HUNTED WITH DOGS AND GVNS.—Conedfrom p. 15. 

" Negroes Taken. — Four gentlemen of this vicinity, went out yester- 
day for the purpose of finding the camp of some noted runaways, sup- 
posed to be near this place ; the camp was discovered about eleven o'clock, 
the negroes, four in number, three men and one woman, tried to make 
their escape through the cane ; two of them were fired on, one of which 
made his escape ; the other one fell after running a short distance.— 

Franklin, La. Republican, Aus. 19,1837. 

'' A runaway's den was discovered on Sunday near the Washington 
Spring, in a little patch of woods, near the road, where there has been 
daily passing. The inmates took the alarm and made their escape ; but 
Mr. Adams and his excellent dogs being put upon the trail, soon run 
down and secured them."— Macon (Ga.) Telegraph, Nov. 27, 1S38. 

The following fact is stated on the authority of Mr. Wm. Willis, of 



42 Anti- Slavery Almanac, [1840. 



Green Plains, Clark co. Ohio ; formerly of Caroline co. on the eastern 
shore of Maryland. 

" Mr. W. knew a slave called Peter White, who was sold to be taken to 
Georgia : he escaped, and lived a long- time in the woods — was finally 
taken. When he found himself surrounded, he surrendered himself 
quietly. When his pursuers had him in their possession, they shot him 
in the leg, and broke it, out of mere wantonness. 

" To the Editor of the Constitutionalist : — I have just returned from an 
inquest I held over the body of a negro man, a runaway, that was shot 
near the South Edisto, in this District, (Barnwell,) on Saturday last. He 
came to his death' by his own recklessness. He refused to be taken alive. 
He was at first, (when those in pursuit of him found it absolutely neces- 
sory,) shot at with small shot, with the intention of crippling him. He 
was shot at several times, and at last he was so disabled as to be compel- 
led to surrender. He kept in the run of a creek in a very dense swamp 
all the time that the neighbors were in pursuit of him.

"WE SHALL BE RID OF THEM." 

These six monosyllables tell the whole story of Colonization. They 
are the true Colonization countersign, in its own vernacular, a Shibboleth 
which its organs never stick at ; it flows from its tongue spontaneous as 
its own saliva. 

Since the Rev. Dr. Finley first strung these words together, twenty 
years ago, in his famous letter assigning his reasons for sending the free 
people of color to Africa, they have been the rallying cry of colonization. 

The Dr. was frank ; he spoke just as he felt. That " We shall be rid 
of them,^^ was the first consideration with him, we infer from the fact that 
it popped out first when he opened his mouth to give his reasons. The 
remaining ones, such as ' good to the public,' ' good to the slave,' * good to 
Africa,' &c., would naturally suggest themselves to an ingenious mind, 
quickened by ihe stimulation of the master emotion, to cast about for 
other reasons, having a savor of benevolence. •' We shall be rid of 
them," is the grand steam-generator, that drives all the machinery of Co- 
lonization, and the great body of professed Colonizationists knoio it. 
Multitudes of them acknowledge it. Some, perhaps, are even yet pro- 
pelled by it unconsciously, but that state of mind which blinds them 
to the motive which moves them is itself sin. If any of our 
readers think we judge hardly, and insist that some who still sup- 
port the Colonization Society are free from that feeling misnam- 
ed " prejudice against color," here are a few simple tests. Try them 
on such persons, and we are content to abide the result. Do they treat 
colored persons just as they treat white persons ? Does it come natural 
and easy to them ? Do they associate with them as equals ? Does their 
kindness toward them put on the form of benevolence to equals or of fa- 
vors bestowed in condescension upon inferiors ? If a colored man in- 
sults them, do they feel no more affronted than if insulted by a white ? 
If a colored man takes a seat beside them at church, in a rail car, or at 
a public table, do they think no more of it than though he were a white ? 
Are the civilities which they interchange with their colored acquaintances 
equally courteous with those which they observe with their other acqaint- 
ances ? We have room for only one more : — do colored persons feel fully 
at ease in their presence, and does their whole bearing convince them that 
they are free from that feeling called '* prejudice against color ?"

" COMPENSATION"—" STOLEN GOODS." 

Slaveholders say, " if we emancipate our slaves you shall pay us for 
them." No pro-slavery dogma has been abjured by abolitionists more 
heartily than this. '' What !" say they, " hire you to stop sinning ?" 
" Buy you off from robbery ?" " Recognize your right to your slaves by 
buying it out ?" " Get you to stop stealing for the rest of your life by 
paying you in the lump as much as you would steal if you kept on ?" 
So strongly is this doctrine of " compensation" reprobated by aboHtion- 
ists, that if an abolition editor or lecturer, no matter what his influence, 
should advocate it, we should all denounce him as a traitor to the cause ; 
if we did not, we should ourselves be traitors to it. Now we have a j 
word to say to those abolitionists who make a loud outcry about hiring 
men to stop stealing, and yet buy their stolen goods. Believing iti 
right to hire men to stop stealing is rank heresy — but to hire them to keep ; 
on stealing, is orthodoxy! Whoever advocates the former must be aj 
traitor — but the strongest advocates of the latter are " faithful and true !" j 
Paying money to slaveholders on condition that they will not snatch i 
from the rightful owners what belongs to them, is treason to the cause : \ 
hut after they have snatched it, paying them money on condition tliatthey 
will let you have it for your own use, is cleaving fast to principle ! Buy- 1 
ing out the slaveholder's stolen right to the product of the slave's labor, in' 
order that the slave may have his own, is recreancy to principle ; but buying 
out this same stolenright, in order that you may have the slave's own, is 
strictly consistent with immaculate aboUtionism ! To get pirates to aban- 
don the high seas, by giving them a round sum, is shocking immorality ', 
bul to buy their cargoes as fast as they bring them in, and even to bargain 
for them in advance, when they set out on their cruises for plunder, is vir- 
tue pure ! The actual difference ])etween compensating the slaveliolders 
for emancipating their slaves, and buying of them the products of their 
labor, is just this ; in the first case j'ou compensate them for giving to their 
slaves what belongs to them — in the other, you compensate them for giv- 
ing to you what belongs to the slaves. Now the true way to make your re- 
bukes tell on thieves and robbers, is to buy their plunder ; be a steady cus- 
tomer — only let them know that they can depend upon you to buy out 
their stock as fast as they s^eaZ in, and rely upon it, they can't stand that : 
if under such preaching and such pratice they don't bolt back to honesty, 
and stick to it for life, they've got no human nature. 

Now we say to all abolitionists who buy of the slaveholders what they 
steal from the slaves, thus making them your agents in robbery, and 
yourselves not merely their employers, customers, and patrons, but their 
bribers — your example counteracts your rebukes, your practice contra- 
dicts your precepts, your works call to naught your faith, and turn to 
mockery your prayers. If you expect ever to make slaveholders stop 
stealing — begin your work by thundering in their ears you shan't steal for 
US. Until you do that, you " sow the wind," and you may thank your, 
selves that you " reap the whirlwind." 

Oh, but these slave-product abolitionists, forsooth, REBUKE slavehold- 
ers I " Terrible — very terrible !" So deacon Honesty always rebuked a 
chicken thief, by bawling in his ears the eighth commandment, while pay. 
ing him his price for the fowls as fast as he wrung their necks. The deacon 
hearing his neighbor's hens cackle one night, bolted conscientiously out of 
bed to " rebuke" the poacher. The deacon and the poacher were old ac- 
quaintances — whenever they met the deacon always faithfully rebuked 
him for hispractices, and as faithfully bought all his plunder. So when the 
deacon made his appearance in his night cap, at the door of the hen-roost. 



44 Anil- Slavery Almanac, [1840. 



and as he was wont on such occasions, opened his mouth with the eighth 
corrmandment, the poacher, nothing flustered, scrambled along the 
poles, wringinii t^e necks and plumping down the pullets. " Thou shall not 
steal,^' said the deacon ; "how do you sell these fowl-s ?" " You are com- 
mitting sin," " what will you take for the lot ?" " / say you are a chicken 
thief;" " I'll give you a shilhng a head." " The Bible says, Let him that 
stole steal no more ;" " what's your price for this young rooster ?'' "/ 
put it to your conscience ; is this loving yourneighhor as yourself?''' — "■' I'll 
give you eighteen pence for the last you threw down." " You are so. 
leinnly bound immediately to break off from stealing — to break off gra- 
dually is serving the devil." " But," says the chicken thief, " I won't 
stop unless you'll ' compensate,^ me for it." " Compensate you," cries the 
deacon. " What ! hire you to stop stealing — pay you for doing your duty ? 
recognize your right to what you steal by paying you for leaving it in the 
owner's possession ? Not I — I've too much principle — repent, I say, and 
quit stealing at once" — " but you didn't set your price on that last chick- 
en." " You arc a roaber I tell you ;" " that's a fat one, what will you take 
for it ?" '' / say you live by plundering^ and are as bad as a pirate." 
'' You've got them all, have you? — this is the last is it ? — well its a poor 
thing, not worth more than sixpence, if you have a mind to take that for it 
here is the money. '' There, you vile poaching wretch, you have robbed 
your poor neighbor of all his fowls, in spite of my burning rebukes." 
" Now, if after all my faithfulness you are still bent on robbing hen-roosts, 
remember deacon Honesty likes poultry, and is good pay — ^just bring 
along your fowls and you'll be sure of a market — but recollect, oh thief, 
every neck you wring, that the Bible says, " thou shalt not steal." 

HOW IT STRIKES SLAVEHOLDERS. 

To show those abolitionists who persist in buying and using the pro. 
ducts of slave labor how their conduct strikes slaveholders, we will state 
two facts. Four years ago a Presbyterian minister, a slaveholder, who re- 
si les in one of the most southern states, said to an abolitionist of our ac- 
quaintance, '' I have made up my mind that abolitionists are not honest : 
they tell us that we steal from our slaves, and yet they don't hesitate to 
buy our stolen goods. Now if they believed what they say and were ho- 
nest men, they would act out their convictions, and refuse to buy of us 
what they say we steal." 

Another slaveholder, to whom the same abolitionist broached the sub- 
ject of slavery, said, " Stop, sir, I must ask you a question first, do you 
wear cotton ?" "Yes." " Was it raised by slaves ?" " No, by freemen," 
was the reply — ''Then I'll talk with you, sir," said the slaveholder. " You 
are a consistent man ; but I asked the same question to an abolitionist the 
other day, who wanted to discuss with me, and he confessed that he dealt 
in slave products. I told him that he was a hypocrite, and I would have 
nothing to say to him." 

The following is an extract from the annual message of Governor Ea- 
ton to the legislature of the territory of Florida, in 1836 : 

" Do the profits of southern farms belong exclusively to those who plant 
and gather the cotton which slave labor produces ? or is not the northern 
ship owner who freights it — the northern manufacturer who spins and 
sells it, and the northern merchant, who exchanges his goods, wares, wines 
and merchandize for articles thus produced, equally liable and culpable in 
a moral point of view ? For myself I am unable to perceive the differ, 
ence bstween one who, owning slaves, causes cotton and other staples to 
be ;,frown, and thence produces profit, and another, who, not owning them. 



1840.] Anti-Slavery Almanac, 45 



becomes a dealer, and trader, and gainer, in the products of their labor, 
knowing them to be such. It is one and the same thing, so far as good 
morals, charity, and a spirit of freedom are concerned ; and he who ma. 
nifests indignant feelings towards the owner, who, through the labor 
of his slaves, produces and grows the article, should also feel for the 
culpability and consciences of the freighter, the Merchant and the ma- 
nufacturer, who are equally and alike concerned, and who, as they derive 
profit and advantage from this same description of bondaged people, are 
entitled to a full share of whatever opprobrium can attach." 

Free goods can be obtained at the following places. Philadelphia : 
Charles Wise, corner of Arch and 5th street, [cotton and dry goods] ; 
Lydia White, 219 North 2d street; Charles Cadv.'allader, 390, Market

WILL YOU MAKE FLORIDA A SLAVE STATE ? 

Florida has just drawn up before the entrance of the Union, and is crack- 
ing her slave whip on the gate for admission. Chained to her wheels are 
25,000 men, women, and children in fetters. Drive through she will, i 
dragging her shrieking victims after her. if the fainting spirit of liberty 
in the free states does not rouse herself in this her accepted time — per- 
haps, the last. Freemen of the north, heed it or not as you may, Florida, 
with her whips and chains, and thumbscrews — her yokes, and gags, and 
branding irons, and trained bull dogs, and hunters of men — her gory ham. 
mocks steaming in the sun — the bones of her murdered native children 
bleaching on their fathers' graves, or rotting amidst the blood and ashes 
of their conflagrated homes — if she comes into this Union, comes in as 
the scourge of God, and by opening the gate to her, you say, " Thy blood 
be on us and on our children:' Your prayer of blasphemy shall be an- 
swered by " terrible things in righteousness.' " Ye shall eat of the fruit 
of your own way, and be filled with your own devices." You make your- 
selves partners in her sins, and you shall be partakers of her plagues. In 
the Almanac of last year, p. 25, are some facts. Here are a few more. 

Hon. Balie Peyton, of Tennessee, in a speech in the U. S. House 
of Rep. Dec. 15, 1836, (see Nat. Int.,) said : — " The agent of the govern- 
ment, John B. Hogan, gave official information of the greatest outrages 
practised upon the Indians that were erer perpetrated upon any people sa. 
vage or civilized, and yet we have no account of prosecutions and punish- 
ments which have followed these disclosures. Under the pretext of reclaim- 
ing fugitive slaves, the wives and children (of mixed blood) of the Indians 
were seized and carried into bondage. TJie famous Oceola himself 
had his wife taken from him, and that too, it has been said, by a govern- 
ment officer, and was chained by this same officer to a log. This has 
caused the Florida war." What have we fought for ? John Lee Wil- 
liams, a wealthy citizen of Florida, who, in his history of the territory, at- 
tempts to put the best face upon the matter, says, our government deter- 
mined "to remove all the Indians across the Mississippi," and sent forces 
to remove, " against their will, a nation of savages." He says, a large 
portion of the Indians would have remained peaceable to this day, had 
not an order been issued requiring them all to remove. They never 



46 Anti-Slavery Almanac, [1840. 



agreed to remove, either personally or by their representatives, yet " the 
order given to General Scott was to fight the Indians, so long as a man 
of them could be found in Florida." Well does a southern paper (Louis- 
ville Journal) say, " The annals of the civilized world furnish no history 
of a war so disfeputable." Why remove them ? A Mobile paper of 
March 28, 1838, says : " Those who are wiUing to let them stay, have 
lost sight of the fact, that the Seminole country has proved a place of re. 
fuge for negroes." 

After this war had been carried on by a succession of the foulest crimes 
from Jan. 27, 1835, till the beginning of 1839, the U. States Senate 
passed a bill (25 to 18,) for the armed occupation of Florida, which, in the 
language of a senator was, " to establish a corps of citizen soldiers, grant 
them 4,000,000 acres of land, and give them liberty to kill, when, where, 
how, and whom they pleased, without any earthly responsibility." Allen, 
of Ohio ; Buchanan, of Pa. ; Hubbard and Pierce, of N.H. ; Lyon and 
Norvell, of Mich. ; Niles and Smith, of Ct. ; Robinson and Young, of 111. ; 
Wall, of N. J. ; and Wright, of N. Y., all voted for this murderous bill ; 
but it was lost in the House. The New York papers of June 18, 1839, 
on the authority of a southern paper, the Columbus (Ga.) Enquirer, say, 
that the people of the territory " had determined to take the war into their 
own hands, and that " the territorial government had offered a reward 
OF ^200 for every Indian taken or killed." 

At a public meeting of the Citizens of Tallahassee and vicinity, June 
8, 1839, it was " unanimously resolved, that the Seminole Indians and the 
inhabitants of Florida cannot maintain peace and live in the same 
COUNTRY, and if any treaty shall be ratified locating these Indians in Flo 
rida, it will be a paper treaty only. They also resolved, "That the pe- 
ninsula of Florida is the last place in the limits of the United States 
where the Indians should be permitted to remain, for obvious reasons." 
1 and 2, They are accessible to our enemies, and would be guides to 
them in war ; A, ''If located in Florida, all the runaway slaves will find 
refuge and protection with them." 4, " The contiguity of emancipated 
colored people of the West Indies, would, in a war with some foreign 
power, place Florida, and in fact the whole of our Southern States, in 
jeopardy."— Tallahassee Star, June 11, 1839. 

Here is a plain statement of the case. The people of Florida want the 
red men's land, and they are determind to kill them, Bridget it ; besides, 
they know that the only way to keep their slaves is to let them have no 
place to flee to. ' 

If any body thinks that Congress has parted with its constitutional 
" power to make all needful regulations respecting the territory" of Flo. 
rida, the following extract from the Congressional Journals will show his 
mistake. 

June 20, 1836, Daniel Webster, from the Committee on Finance, re- 
ported a bill to annul certain acts of the legislature of Florida. June 23, 
bill passed without a division. Approved July 2. 

Can't they annul acts relating to property in men as well as in money ? 



MISCELLANEOUS « HORRIBLES." 

Extract of a letter from Mr. Samuel Hall, a teacher in Marietta College. 

" Mr. Curtis, a journeyman cabinet-maker, of Marietta, every way 
worthy of credit, relates the following, of which he was an eye-witness. 

^' In September, 1837, at ' Milligan's Bend,' in the Mississippi river, I 
saw a negro with an iron band around his head, locked behind with a 
padlock. In the front, where it passed the mouth, there was a projection 



1840.] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 47 



inward of an inch and a half, which entered the mouth. The overseer 
told me, he kept this gag constantly on him, so that, if he ran away, he 
could not eat, and would starve to death. 

Alfred Wilkinson, assessor of the town of Skeneateles, N. Y., testifies 
as follows : — " I stayed in New Orleans three weeks : durino- that time 
there used to pass by where I stayed a number of slaves, each with an 
iron band around his ankle, a chain attached to it, and an eighteen pound 
ball at the end. One day I counted nineteen of them. These, I learned, 
were runaway slaves from the plantations. 

" There was also a negro woman that used daily to come to the mar- 
ket with milk ; she had an iron band around her neck, with three rods 
projecting from it, about sixteen inches long, crooked at the ends." 

" Was committed to jail, Jim— liadon a large lock chain around his 
neck" — " Southern Sun," September 22, 1838. 

Ranaway Hown — has a ring of iron on his left foot. Also, Grise, his 
wife, having a ring and chain on the left leg. — New Orleans Bee, July 2, 1838. 

Committed to jail, a negro woman named Mary ; has lost one of her 
upper front teeth, and is fettered with irons round her neck and left leg. — 
Joshua Sowden, G. R. D. — Columbia (S. C.) Telescope, Julyl7, 1833. 

'' At Laurel Hill, Richmond county. North Carolina, it was reported; 
that a runaway slave was in the neighborhood. A number of young j 
men took their guns, and went in pursuit. A colored man came along j 
and they ordered him to surrender. He refused, and kept them off with' 
his club. He caught hold of the muzzle of one of the gims, and came j 
near getting possession of it. At length he started to run — one of the j 
young men fired, and lodged the whole charge between his shoulders ; he) 
fell and died without telling who his master was, or whether he had any. ! 
A hole was dug by the side of the road, his body tumbled into it, and 
thus ended the matter." — Rev. Francis Hawley, Colebrook, Connecticut. 

A captain in the United States Navy, who married a daughter of the 
collector of the port of Richmand, and resided there, became offended i 
with his negro boy, put him upon a stool, crossed his hands bcfor3 him, 
tied a rope to them, threw it over a joist, drew the boy up so that he| 
.:;ould just stand on the stool with liis toes, and kept him in that position,) 
flogging him severely at intervals, untilHhe boy became so exhausted thalj 
he reeled off the stool, and swung by his hands until he died. The mas- 1 
ter was tried and acquitted. — ffm. Poc, elder of the P res. Church, Delhi, Ohio. 

THE WANE OF FREE PRINCIPLES, 

In this country, since the Revolution, may well fill freemen with! 
amazement. Even thirty years ago many leading editors and politicians 
in slave States, freely spoke of slavery in terms which, if employed now 
by the same persons, would subject them to Lynch law. 

If the following extract from an editorial article, published in the Na- 
tional Intelligencer, at Washington City, in 1805, should appear as an 
editorial article in that paper now, the office would probably be torn down 
by a mob, and the paper burned by committees of vigilance and Lynch 
clubs all over the south. As an introduction to the article it may be 
stated, tliat the legislature of the Indiana Territory — (whose population 
then was almost wholly from slave states) — had sent up a memorial to 
Congress, praying a suspension of the sixth article of the Ordinance of! 
'87, in order to enable the inhabitants of the territory to hold slaves' 
there. The editor of the Intelligencer, in speaking of this pro-slavery 
movement, has the following noble outburst: — " It is with the deepest 
^regret that we discharge the painful duty of inviting the public atten- 



48 Anti-Slaxiery Almanac. [1840. 



tion to the recent conduct of the legislature of Indiana. It cannot beeur- 
prising that a subject so odious and humiliating as that of slavery, should 
awaken the liveliest sensibilities of a free people, when those whose duty it 
is to lessen^ are engaged in invigorating the evil. Since the era of our 
independence, it is our pride that, with a solitary exception, we have zea. 
lously strove to lessen it. Among the proudest trophies that embellish 
our national character^ is that act of the old Congress, which, in pro- 
viding a government for the territory north-west of the Ohio, declares that 
there shall be ' neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said ter- 
ritory.' This language of Congress is memorable, as it shows that the 
dignified and enlightened body, under whose auspices the liberties of 
America were achieved, still retained an undiminished respect for the 
great and eternal principles of freedom. They preface the enumeration 
of the permanent rules with these emphatic words. " For extending 
the fundamenal principles of civil and religious liberty, which form the 
basis on which these republics, their laws, and constitutions are erected, 
to fix and establish those principles as the basis of all laws, constitutions, 
and governmnts, which forever hereafter shall be formed in the said 
territory," &c. — See National Iiiteliigencer, March 7, 180G. 

Take another illustration. Less than twenty years ago, Hon. Richard 
M. JoH.vsoN, now Vice-President of the United States, in his speech in 
the U S. Senate on the Missouri Question, recommended the formation of 
"Abolition Societies" for the doing away of slavery, and urged that 
they should be stimulated to energetic action. The following is an ex- 
tract from his speech, Feb. 1, 1820. — See National Intelligencer, April, 29, 1820. 

" The energies of the Christian world are now combined in the diffusion 
of evangelical light, and the principles it inculcates are every day relax, 
ing the bonds of slavery. Providence, all wise and inscrutable in its ways, 
is gradually effecting the ultimate object of our wishes, which your ill- 
timed opposition is calculated only to retard. Individual exertion, acting 
in concert, [Anti-Slavery Societies,] can alone prepare the way. En- 
courage Sunday Schools, multiply Bible Societies, increase missionary ex- 
ertions, ANIMATE TO DEEDS OF BENEVOLENCE ABOLITION 
SOCIETIES, and perfect the system of colonization, then trust the kind 
providence of God for the result, and you will perform the duties of 
Christians and patriots in the service of God and ins creatures." 

In the above commendation of Abolition Societies, Richard M. John- 
son did not jump in the dark. He well knew whereof he affirmed. A 
number of such societies had been formed in Kentucky not long previous 
to that time, and some of them, if we mistake not, in his own vicinity. 
Rev. J, Rankin, now of Ripley, Ohio, author of "Letters on Slavery," 
published fifteen years ago — was then (1820) pastor of the Concord 
Presbyterian Church, Kentucky, and actively engaged in those societies.* 
Besides this, the " Em.ancipating Baptists" had organized association in 
Kentucky, some years before. Col. Johnson had witnessed the effects 
produced by these societies — hence his recommendation of the principle 
of "individual exertion, acting in concert," for the abolition of slaA'ery. 

Now if Richard M. Johnson had made such a speech in 1836, instead 
of being elected Vice-President of the United States, he would, probably, 
have been mobbed out of Congress, mobbed by his constituents at home, 
and hung and burned in effigy throughout the slave states, and by 
" gentlemen of property and standing" in the free. 



* In May 1839, Rev. J. Rankin said, " those Abolition Societies were laboring for the 
same object for which the American Anti-Slavery Society is now laboring; but the for- 
mation of the Colonization Society destroyed their vitality."
