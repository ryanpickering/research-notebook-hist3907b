WEST- INDIAN SKETCHES. &c. 



A SECOND edition of Dr. Pinck- 
ard's Notes on the West Indies has 
recently made its appearance. No 
publication could be more season- 
able. It exhibits the impression 
made on the mind of an intelligent 
and disinterested spectator, at first 
evidently prejudiced in favour of 
West- Indian manners, who has had 
an opportunity of seeing w^ith his 
own eyes the real nature and effects 
of colonial bondage. It seems 
the more necessary to bring for- 
ward to the view of the public, 
at this particular time, a witness 
so respectable, and so far removed 
from any suspicion of partiality or 
party feeling, asDr.Pinckard; since, 
in the warmth of the conflict on 
West-Indian subjects which is now 
carrying on, the colonial partizans 
appear disposed to deny the ex- 
istence even of the most prominent 
features of their own system ; for 
example, the practice of driving. 
We shouKl as soon have expected to 
hear it denied that a nose formed 
a part of the human countenance, 
as that the practice of driving 
the Negroes at their work by the 
impulse of the cart-whip, was not 
generally prevalent in the West 
Indies. Exceptions from this com- 
mon rule may doubtless be pro- 
duced — so may men without noses : 
but from such rare examples it 
would be most obviously unfair to 
object to the general statement. 
The fact is — a fact capable of the 
clearest proof from the direct evi- 
dence, or the unavoidable conces- 
sions, of West-Indians themselves — 
that the Negroes in general labour 
undtr the lash, and are compelled 
to exertion either by the terror or 
the actual pain of its infliction. 
Od some future occasion, should it 



be necessary, a variety of authentic 
attestations to this fact will be 
presented to the public view. In 
the mean time, the testimony of Dr. 
Pinckard may be regarded as quite 
decisive. Drivers, of whom there 
are one or more on all estates, this 
interesting writer describes to be 
" Slaves so termed from being pro- 
moted to the distinguished oifice of 
following their comrades upon all 
occasions with a whip at their 
backs, as an English carter follows 
his horses." In short, it would be 
as reasonable to deny that slavery 
exists in the West Indies at all, 
as to deny that the slaves are com- 
pelled to labour by the impulse 
of the whip. 

The object of the present paper, 
however, is not to enter on the dis* 
cussion of this particular question, 
but to present the public with one 
of those graphic representations of 
West-Indian manners and feelings, 
in respect to the slave population, 
with which Dr. Pinckard's work 
has furnished us, and which relates 
not to tlie conduct of an individual, 
but to the administration of criminal 
justice, and the judicialproceedings 
of public functionaries. The let- 
ter from which the extract is taken 
bears date in Demarara, the 16tU 
May, 1796. 

•' I wish I could repeat to you," 
observes Dr. Pinckard, " as elo- 
quently as 1 heard it related, the 
very interesting detail of an ex- 
pedition sent into the woods a- 
gainst the Bush-negroes, last year, 
under the command of Major 
M'Grah and Captain Dougau. 
Many persons had been robbed, 
and iiad their property otherwise 
injured by their predatory excur- 
sions: indeed the whole colony 



was disturbed, and, from the in- 
creasing number of these sangui- 
nary hordes, was threatened with 
eventual destruction. It was re- 
solved, therefore, that a body of 
troops should be sent into the 
woods to search for their places of 
resort, and to endeavour to subdue 
or exterminate them. A party of the 
Dutch soldiers of the garrison was 
accordingly equipped for this duty, 
and marched in due military order 
into the forest. 

" But this was not the species of 
force calculated for such an enter- 
prise: from not having observed 
all the minute precautions re- 
quired in this new and hazardous 
warfare, they were surprised and 
defeated by the Blacks ; and very 
few of the soldiers escaped, most of 
them being killed, and their scalps, 
or bodies, fised against the trees, 
to serve as examples of what others 
were to expect who should venture 
on a similar service. 

*• The government and the colo- 
nists, having discovered, from fatal 
experience, that the Bush-negroes 
were more formidable than had 
been imagined; and finding that 
regular European troops were not 
the best fitted for this kind of duty, 
raised a corps of Blacks from 
among the most faithful of the 
slaves, and also engaged in their 
interest a party of Indians fiom the 
woods, Mho, happily for the plant- 
ers, hold the Bush-negroes in great 
abhorrence. 

" Well provided and equipped, 
this second expedition, commanded 
as above-mentioned, separated into 
two parties, and boldly advanced 
into the forest to form a combined 
attack. Upon their march, they 
passed the dead bodies of the 
Dutch soldiers, tied to the trees at 
the sides of a narrow path. Not 
deterred by this horrid scene, they 
proceeded onward, having the sa- 
gacious Indians on their flanks ; by 
whose acuteness and penetration 
they discovered the various situa- 
tions where the different compa- 
nies of the brigands had taken up 



their residence, and, by well-con- 
certed attacks, defeated and routed 
them wheresoever they met them. 
As mi encouragement to the able 
and new-raised troops, a premium 
was offered for every right hand 
of a Bush-negro that should he 
brought in ; and, when they re- 
turned from the woods, they ap- 
peared with seventy Mack arms 
displayed upon the points of their 
bayonets, causing a very singular 
and shocking sj)ectacle to the be- 
holders. Three hundred guilders 
each had been fixed as the price ; 
but it was found necessary to re- 
duce the premium, lest the slaves 
should kill their prisoners, or even 
destroy each other to obtain it. 

" The exertion and fatigue re- 
quired in such a movement cannot 
well be conceived by those who 
are accustomed only to regular 
and systematic warfare: nor is 
it probable that such a service 
could have been supported in this 
climate by European soldiers. In 
addition to all the difficulties of 
making their way through the un- 
known and almost impenetrable 
woods, they knew not where to 
find the enemy's posts; and were, 
at every minute, liable to be fallen 
upon by surprise. 

" At first entering the bush, the 
march was continued for a great 
distance, nearly knee-deep in water: 
when further advanced, the troops 
had to scramble through the thick- 
ets, or follow each other, by a con- 
fined path, in Indian file ; and, 
after the harassing march of the 
day, to lie down at night, on the 
bare ground, under the trees, the 
officers suspending their hammocks 
from bough to bough in the open 
air. They had, moreover, to carry 
the whole of their provisions, arms, 
ammunition, and every other neces- 
sary required for the success of the 
enterprise, upon their backs. 

" But for the assistance given by 
the Indians, the brigands would, 
probably, never have been sub- 
dued ; perhaps not found ! The 
e;»pertness of these men, in such 



a pursuit, is peculiar, and beyond 
all that could be imagined, by those 
who live in crowded society. They 
not only hear sounds in the woods, 
which are imperceptible to others, 
but judge, with surprising accuracy, 
of the distance and direction from 
whence they proceed. The po- 
sition of a fallen leaf, or the bend- 
ing of a bramble, too slight to be 
noticed by an European eye, con- 
veys to them certain intelligence 
respecting the route taken by those 
whom they pursue. From constant 
practice and observation, their 
organs of sense become highly 
improved ; and they hear with an 
acuteness, and see with a precision, 
truly surprising to those who are 
unacquainted with their habits and 
their vigilance. With such guides, 
the corps moved in confidence, and 
was conducted with safety. Seven 
encampments of the brigands were 
discovered, and completely routed; 
some of which had existed during 
fifteen years, concealed in the pro- 
foundest gloom of the forest. 

" The following was the mode 
usually observed in establishing 
these places of residence and re- 
sort. Having fixed upon the spot 
most convenient for their purpose, 
a circular piece of ground was 
cleared of its wood : in the centre 
of this, they built huts, and formed 
the encampment, planting around 
the buildings, oranges, bananas, 
plantains, yams, eddoes, and other 
kinds of provisions; thus, in addi- 
tion to the trees of the forest, pro- 
curing themselves further conceal- 
ment by the plantations which gave 
them food. The eddoes were 
found in great plenty, and seemed 
to constitute their principal diet. 
Round the exterior of the circular 
spot was cut a deep and wide 
ditch, which, being filled with 
water, and stuck, at the sides and 
bottom, with sharp-pointed stakes, 
served as a formidable barrier of 
defence. The path across this 
ditch was placed two or three feet 
below the surface, and wholly con- 
cealed from the eye by the wati r 



being always thick and muddy. 
Leaves were strewed, and steppings, 
similar in their kind, made to the 
edges of the ditch, at various parts, 
as a precaution, to deceive any 
who might approach, respecting 
the real situation of the path. But 
the proper place of crossing was 
found out by the sagacity of the 
Indians, who soon discovered that 
to attempt to pass at any other 
part was to be impaled alive. 

" It was found that the brigands 
had eight of these encampments, 
or points of rendezvous, in the 
woods, one of which is supposed 
still to remain undiscovered. After 
much fatigue in endeavouring to 
find it, the search was relinquished, 
in the idea that some of the pri- 
soners, either by indulgence or 
torture, would be induced to make 
it known : but this expectation has 
oidy led to disappointment. All 
the means used have failed ; and the 
prisoners, faithful to their cause, 
have suffered torture and death 
without betraying their forest' 
associates^ 

" The cruel severities inflicted 
uponthesemiserahleBlackshaveheen 
such as you will scarcely believe 
could have been practised by any 
well-ordered government: for, how- 
ever strongly punishment was me- 
rited, the refinement of torture, 
with which it was employed, ought 
never to have been tolerated in any 
state prof essing to be civilized. Hu' 
manity shudders at the bare recital 
of it. 

" Most of the ringleaders were 
taken, and brought to Stabroek, 
where they were afterwards tried 
and executed ; the majority of them 
suffering with a degree of fortitude 
and iieroism worthy a better cause. 
One in particular, named Amster- 
dam, supported the extreme of 
punishment wilh a firmness truly 
astonishing. He was subjected to 
the most, shocking torture, in the 
hope of comj)elling liini to give 
information regarding the remain- 
ing ciicauipment — but in vain ! He 
despised the severest suffering, and 



nothing could induce him to betray 
his late companions, or to make 
known their yet undiscovered re- 
treat*. 

" He was sentenced to he burnt 
alive, first having his fiesh torn 
from his limbs with red-hot pincers; 
and in order to render his punish- 
ment still more terrible, he was 
compelled to sit by, and see thirteen 
others broken upon the wheel and 
hung ; and then, in being conduct- 
ed to execution, was made to walk 
over the thirteen dead bodies of his 
comrades. Being fastened to an 
iron stake, surrounded with the 
consuming pile, which was about 
to be illumined, he regarded the 
by-standers with all the compla- 
cency of heroic fortitude, and, ex- 
hibiting the most unyielding cou- 
rage, resolved that all the torture 
ingenuity or cruelty might invent 
should not extort from him a single 
groan, or a syllable that could in 
any way impeach his friends. 

" With the first pair of pincers, 
the executioner tore the flesh from 
one of his arms.The sudden infliction 
of pain caused him to recede, in 
a slight degree, from the irons ; 
and he drew in his breath, as if to 
form it into a sigh, but he instantly 
recovered himself. His counte- 
nance indicated self-reproach, and 
he manifestly took shame for hav- 
ing betrayed even the slightest 
sense of suffering ; then, resuming 
more, if possible, than his former 
composure, he patiently waited 
the approach of the next irons, 
and, on these being brought to- 
wards him, he steadfastly cast his 
eye upon them, inclined a little 
forward, and with an unshaken 
firmness of countenance, delibe- 
rately met their burning grasp ! 
From that moment he shewed him- 
self capable of despising the se- 
verest pain. Not a feature was 
afterwards disturbed, and he pre- 
served a degree of tranquillity im-

capable of enduring a tale of horror, 
will do well to proceed no farther in the 
narration. 



plying absolute confenlpt of tor- 
ture and of death. 

" Finally, when the destructive 
pile was set in flames, his body 
spun round the iron stake, with 
the mouth open, until his head fell 
back, and life was extinguished. 
I am told, by a gentleman who had 
the melancholy task to attend the 
execution, that the most horrid 
stench continued for many hours, 
to issue from the roasting body, 
and was extremelyofFensive through- 
out the town, penetrating so strong- 
ly into the houses to leeward, as 
to make many persons sick, and 
prevent them from taking food 
during the remainder of the day." - 

Well may humanity shudder at 
such a recital. But if the trans- 
action be too horrid even to be 
told, what must it have been to 
be witnessed — and still more, to 
be felt? And is it in the uncoH' 
trouled power of persons capable 
of perpetrating such atrocities, that 
the British Parliament and Nation 
will be content to leave the des- 
tinies of so many of their fellovt'- 
subjects? We must no longer 
squeamishly turn aside our vievf 
from these spectacles of horror. 
This nation can no longer decline 
the duty of examining them, aye, 
and of remedying them too. 

But we shall be told, that twenty 
years have passed since these scenes 
were acted ; and that the state of 
the Slaves in the West Indies has 
been greatly improved during the 
interval. Be it so. But to what 
is this improvement, even if we 
admit that it has taken place, to be 
attributed but to the controul of 
public opinion in this country, and 
to the influenceof those public dis- 
cussions which West Indians would 
deprecate as the worst of evils] 

But may there not be some room 
to question whether the temper and 
feelings of the White population of 
the West Indies towards the Slaves 
have undergone any marked change 1 
The doubt refers not to enlightened 
proprietors residing in this couii- 



try ; nor to various cases of men of 
enlarged minds and liberal educa- 
tion residing in the colonies ; but 
to the body of resident Whites. 
The recent transactions in Bar- 
badoes, it must be allowed, for 
example, do not furnish any striking 
proof of the alleged improvement. 
Only two White men at most, more 
recent accounts state only one, fell 
during the commotion ; and it is 
even now doubted whether that 
single death is to be ascribed to 
the insurgent Blacks. But what has 
been the course pursued by the 
Whites? Numbers of unresisting 
Slaves, it is admitted, have been 
killed by the militia. Numbers 
besides have since been executed 
on the scaffold ; and the thirst 
for Negro blood, it appears from 
good authority, is not yet satiated, 
A thousand executions are said to 
have taken place in the course of a 
few weeks. We should like to read 
the minutes of the trials which have 
issued in this summary and tre- 
mendous ACT OF JUSTICE. Why, 
if in this kingdom, containing twelve 
millions of people, rebellion had 
threatened the life of our monarch, 
and the overthrow of his govern- 
ment by open war, what should we 
have said to a thousand executions? 
And yet in the petty island of Bar- 
badoes, containing not a hundred- 
and-fiftieth part of that popula- 
tion, a thousand human beings 
have been judicially executed in the 
course of a few weeks*. 

* Lest this statement should be sus- 
pected of exaggeration, it may be pro- 
per to insert the following extracts of 
letters from Barbadoes, dated May 16, 
1816. " Martial law is still in force. 
The militia are much harassed by the 
constant and vigilant guard they are 
forced to keep, and by their frequent 
march about the country in search of 
the insurgents, and in escorting those 
who are to be hung to their diHerent 
places of execution on tiieir owners' 
plantations. The great number of pri- 
•onerson board the prison-shi|)s nuiuire 
a perpetual guard." "About I,()(i0 of 
the insurgents have already lost their 
lives. The slaves shew niucli sulkiucss 



Demarara, the very scene of tbfe 
enormities related by Dr. Pinck- 
ard, will furnish another example. 
There one of the criminal judges, 
J. Clayton Jenyns, no longer ago 
than in November 1815, publish- 
ed in the gazette of that colony^ 
a letter addressed to the United 
Society of Merchants and Plant- 
ers, containing, among many othef 
things equally outrageous, the fol- 
lowing sentiments: — " I will ven- 
ture to state it as my humble opi- 
nion, that the authority of the mas- 
ter over his Negroes, it being con- 
stantly employed on minute delails, 
and being in its nature prompt and 
of hourly application, is not to be 
encumbered with othcial forma- 
lities. The sudden exercise of it 
is indispensably necessary to keep 
them to obedience and their duty." 
" It is a power to be exercised by 
the proprietors as sote chief and 
magistrate." " It would become 
entirely impracticable to check and 
to restrain the disorders which 
would ripen into serious evils if 

who remain quiet and keep at their 
work.'' " Numbers of Negroes have 
been shot and otherwise destroyed, and 
a great many more remain to be exe- 
cuted. They were brought in by dozens 
every day." 

How is this statement to be reconciled 
with what was announced by the high- 
est authority ; namely, that the insur- 
rection had been entirely suppressed 
within a few days after it had broken 
out? And where is this work of death 
to stop? — While it is proceeding, too, 
the Barbadians seem to make it a crime 
that the quiet and peaceable part of the 
slave population should shew " sulki- 
ness.'' What is it to s/ira'sulkiness? To 
look grave and dejected ? And is it in 
human nature to look otherwise, while 
executions, perhaps of friends and rela- 
tions, are the regular order of the day; 
while farther arrests are daily multiplied 
(dozens every day) ; while the persons 
who so look know not but a similar fate 
awaits themselves ; while the island 
presents one great Aceldama, and even 
the militia of Barbadoes are fatigued 
with their bloody labour? Would the 
Barbadians have their Slaves to look 
gay under such circumstances? 



the masters were not armed with a 
powerful coercive force suddenly to 
apply the remedy. His power can- 
not without danger be brought into 
doubt or discussion: it should never 
be opposed or thwarted by any in- 
termediate authority." Mr. Jenyns 
goes on to deprecate, in the strong- 
est terms, the interference of public 
functionaries, and intimates that 
the honour of the planters is a 
sufficient security for the well- 
being of the Slaves. 

And who is it that thus writes 1 
The Fiscal, the criminal judge of 
the colony ; the very nian to whom 
the protection of the Slaves from 
domestic oppression is officially 
committed by his Majesty. But if the 
criminal judge himself, the official 
guardian of the Slaves, shall dare, 
openly and in the bearing of the 



community at large, thus to ex- 
press his sentiments; what may 
we reasonably expect to be the 
views and feelings of the mass of 
tho«e whom he addresses? And 
shall we wonder if the Slaves of 
Deraarara, thus avowedly abandon- 
ed by their only legal protector, 
to the " tender mercies" of those 
who could tolerate the scenes de- 
scribed by Dr. Pinckard, should 
be goaded to insubordination and 
revolt? And is not this a case for 
the anxious consideration of the 
British Parliament and the British 
Public 1 Shall we be guiltless of the 
blood that may hereafter be shed, 
if we be deterred by interested 
clamour from due investigation, and 
from the exercise of an adequate 
controul 1

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c. 



There is something extremely re- 
volting to British, and still more to 
Christian, feelings in the parlia- 
mentary recognition of a state of 
slavery, unless it be for the purpose 
ofmitigatingits harshness. Jealous 
as this nation has always been on 
the subject of personal liberty, it 
is not easy to account for the worse 
than apathy with which it has re- 
garded the open and undisguised op- 
pression of hundreds of thousands 
of our fellow-subjects, who are shut 
out not only from all participation 
in British rights, but are destitute 
even of the shadow of legal protec- 
tion, except in what regards life or 
limb. It is a system which stands 
preeminent in cruelty and injustice; 
for notwithstanding the late at- 
tempt of the Assembly of Jamaica, 
to rebut this charge, it may safely 
be affirmed that there is no condi- 
tion of slavery now existing on the 
face of the globe, and that there 
never has existed a state of slavery, 
not even among the Romans, whose 
slave code was by far the most rigo- 
rous of any, which may not be call- 
ed mild in comparison with the sla- 
very of our West-Indian Colonies. 
And yet this slavery, known to be 
thus inhuman and oppressive, con- 
tinues to be recognized, even by a 
British Parliament, without any (t/i- 
red steps being taken for the allevi- 
ation of its miseries. It is indeed 
most strange that such a monstrous 
anomaly as this should ever have ex- 
isted among a people calling them- 
selves Christian. It will be stranger 
itill, if, after its true nature lias 
been fully and accurately ascertain- 
ed, it shall continue to exist, with- 
out some effort to mitigate its evils. 
— Let us contemplate for a moment 
the slate of a slave in the Britiih 



West Indies. He is, in the first 
place, the absolute property of his 
master, and may be sold by him at 
pleasure, precisely in the same man- 
ner in which he may sell a horse or 
a mule. Nor is the master bound, 
in making suchatransfer of a fellow- 
creature, to consider for one mo- 
ment, either the character of the 
individual to whom he conveys by 
the deed of sale his right of proper- 
ty, nor the ties of husband, father, 
wife, or child, which may be sud- 
denly and eternally broken by the 
transfer. In the eye of colonial 
law, the negro slave is a thing, not 
a person. He has absolutely no po- 
litical existence, nor any civil rights. 
He can neither sue nor be sued. 
The testimony of ten thousand 
slaves witnessing a murder would 
avail nothing against a person of 
free condition. Not only would not 
a free person be convicted on such 
testimony, butsuch testimony would 
not even be received. Laws, it is true, 
have lately been passed in most of 
the colonies which make the mur- 
der of a slave a capital felony, and 
which prohibit, under certain pecu- 
niary penalties, the maiming or the 
immoderate corporal punishment of 
slaves. But these laws, forced from 
the colonial assemblies by a desire 
to avert any direct interference of 
the mother country in their interior 
legislation, after having answered 
the purposes of delusion, have been 
allowed, for the most part, to sleep. 
It is, indeed, vain to expect that laws 
will be ethcient which are opposed 
to the feelini;s and prejudices of al- 
most the wholeconimunity, by whom, 
in the cupacity of magistrates and 
jurors they are to be executed. — 
Laws have alio been passt'd for re- 
gulating the food, clothing, hours 
B i 



12 



of labour, and religious instruction 
of the slaves. But it is admitted, 
that these laws were never intended 
to be operative; aud that under the 
e5\i§ting system, it is impossible 
they should. The answer of Go- 
vernor Prevost, of Dominica, to^ an 
inquiryof the Secretary of St ate(Earl 
Camden) on this subject, is fully ap- 
plicable. '• The act of the legisla- 
ture of Dominica," observes the Go- 
vernor, in a letter dated Jan. 17, 
180-5, " entituled 'An Act for the 
Encouragement,Protection, and Go- 
vernment of Slaves,' appears to have 
been considered from the day it ivas 
jyassed until this hour," (it had then 
been in force about eight or ten 
years), " as a political measure, to 
ave^t the interference of the mother 
country in the management of 
slaves." "Having said this, your 
Lordsliip will not be surprised," 
he adds, " to learn that the bill has 
been wholly neglected." 

To the same etTect is tiie Report 
of the late Sir William Young, to 
the Secretary of State, dated Oct. 
G, 18 U. This gentleman, it is well 
known, was for many years au able 
and determined opponent in Par- 
liament of the abolition of the slave 
trade. Soon after that measure was 
carried, he was appointed Governor 
of Tobago. Aftera residence of four 
-years in lhatisland,he thus v.'riies :— 
•' I think the skives have from latv 
no protection. In this, and I doubt 
not in every other, island, there 
are laws for the protection of 
slaves, and good ones; but cir- 
cumstances in the administration of 
Avhateverlaw render it a dead letter. 
When the intervention of the law is 
most required, it will have the least 
effect; as in cases where a vindic- 
tive and cruel master has care to 
commit the most atrocious cruel- 
ties, even to murder of Ms slaves, no 
free person being present to witness 
the act. There appears to me a 
radical defect in the administration 
of justice throughout the West In- 
dies, in whatever case the wrongs 
done to a slave are under conside- 
ration ; or rather, that justice cau- 



not in truth be administered, con" 
trouled as it is by a law of evidence 
which covers the most guilty Euro- 
])eau with impu4iity, provided^that 
when having^ a criminal intent he is 
cautious not to commit the crime 
in the presence of a free witness. 
On small plantations there is often 
but one free person, the resident 
manager, and no slave can appeair 
against him. In the back yard of 
the jobber of a small gang for hire, 
in the workshop or out- buildings 
of each artizan or petty tradesman, 
and within every house, the greatest 
cruelties on a slave may be exer- 
cised without a possibility of con- 
viction," &c. &c. — See Papers of 
House of Commons, ordered to be 
printed July 12, 1815. 

Even Mr. Wilberforce could not 
have exhibited a more unfavourable 
picture of the condition of the West- 
Indian Slave, than is here done by 
Sir William Young, himself a West- 
Indian planter and long zealously 
opposed to the abolition. 

If further proof were wanting 
that the meliorating laws of the 
West Indies, astheyhave been called, 
are little more than a dead letter, 
it might be furnished in abundance. 
It will be sufficient at present to 
produce, in illustration of this po- 
sition, the following authentic state- 
ment ; vvfhich in the month of Au- 
gust, 1810, was laid before Lord 
Liverpool, by him transmitted to 
Governor Elliot, and fully admitted 
by that gentleman to be correct. 

" Case of the King v. Edward 
Uiiggins, sen. Esq. 
" The defendant, Edward Hug- 
gins, sen. Esq. is an eminent planter 
in the island of Nevis ; has been pe- 
culiarly successful oflateyearSjWhile 
other planters have in general had 
very opposite fortune ; and has in 
consequence, been extending his 
possessions progressively, by nevv 
purchases of estates and slaves; so 
that at present he is said to owri 
above six hundred Negroes*. 

* Ttie number has since been greatly 
increased by fresh p.urcliases. ,i

" Unfortunafely, he is an instance 
of the frequent, though short-lived, 
success that attends a rigid exaction 
from the slaves, by means of severe 
discipline, of more than ordinary 
labour. Among other abuses, of 
which, during the Abolition-con- 
troversy, the existence was denied 
in Parliament, this gentleman has 
practised that of compelling his 
unfortunate slaves to perform night- 
work in the field, when the moon- 
light makes it practicable; and the 
kind of labour in which on those 
occasions they are employed, is 
that of carrying out dung from the 
home-stall to the fields, in wicker 
baskets, on their heads." — [See a 
description of this work in the Par- 
liamentary Evidence on the Slave 
Trade; especially that of Sir 
Ashton Byam, attorney-general of 
Grenada, a witness called on the 
part of tlie anti-abolitionists.] 

" Night-work (except in crop 
time, for the purpose of m.ore spee- 
dily cutting and grinding the canes) 
is prohibited by a recent law of the 
islands composing the Leeward is- 
land government. A General Coun- 
cil and Assembly of those islands 
were convened at St. Kitt'sin 1798, 
in consequence of the earnest ap- 
plications of his Majesty's Govern- 
ment (pursuant to a parliamentary 
iiddress) to the colonial governors 
and legislatures, to obtain laws for 
the protection of slaves and the 
melioration of their stale; and an 
act was passed for those purposes, 
by the tenth section of which it is 
enacted, that the slaves shall not 
be turned out to work before five 
o' clock in the morning, nor after 
seven in the evening, except in crop 
time, or IVom some evident neces- 
sity, under the penalty of five 
pounds. 

• " Whether Mr. Huggins's slaves 
■had heard of this law, or whether 
the repugnance of injured nature 
to his op|)ressions j)roduced invo- 
luntary op))osition, is not known; 
but so it was, that some desertions, 
or some appearances of insubordi- 
nation, were asserted to Imve been 



produced by the illegal exaction 6f 
night-work in carrying out dung. 
No insurrection, nor any forcible 
resistance of the master's authority', , 
was proved, or even pretended, on 
the part of Mr. Huggins; and had 
such crimes been committed, the 
civil magistrate in the West Indies 
is always ready enough to punish 
them; nor is the bringing slaves to 
judicial punishment attended with 
any trouble, expense, or delay. 
Mr. Huggins had therefore no ex- 
cuse for taking the law into his own 
hands, if the offence had been of a 
public kind. But it is understood 
to have amounted to no more than 
the private fault of non-obedience 
to unlawful commands of the mas- 
ter or his agents, or, at most, to de- 
sertion from the estate. 

" This gentleman, however, was 
resolved on a vengeance, not only 
extra-judicial, but such as no magis- 
trate, even in cases of the most hei- 
nous public offences, is empowered 
by law to inflict. 

*' Here it is necessary to say 
something of the mode of corporal 
punishment to which Mr. Huggins 
had resort, and its limitation by the 
colonial law. 

" The ordinary punishment of 
slaves, is a whipping with the cart- 
whip, or, as it is called in Jamaica, 
the Cattle Whip, because it is the 
same which the drivers of carts or 
waggons in the West Indies apply 
to their mules or other cattle when 
working in a team. The same instru. 
ment coerces the labour of slaves in 
the field; but when applied as a 
punishment for past faults and in a 
solemn way, its inflictions are much 
more severe. The slave, instead of 
receiving a lash or two horizontally, 
or obliquely, over his jacket, shirt, 
or trowsers (which, nevertheless, is 
sufficiently painful), is laid down on 
the ground, his arms and logs being 
extended, and generally held down, 
and his body laid bare from the 
back downwards. The lash is then 
a})i)lied vertically, by the driver or 
executioner, who stands at the pro- 
per distance to make the sulie4<c«' 



feel the full power of his torturing 
instrument. The report of the lash 
is louder than that of the long 
tvhalebone whips of our London 
carmen; and its eifect so severe 
(except when the drivers are hu- 
manely forbid to cut, as the phrase 
is), that blood is.dravvn, and the 
skin stripped off, by every lash ; till 
at length, if they are numerous, the 
poor victim's flesh, from the small 
of the back or hips down to the 
middle of the thigh, is not only 
excoriated, but cruelly mangled and 
torn. Such deep incisions are often 
made, that the parts, after they are 
healed, retain a shocking appear- 
ance during the rest of life. 

" From this account of the pu- 
nishment, it will not seem strange 
that the number of lashes has been 
limited, by general practice as well 
as by law, to a number less than 
forty. In most of the penal slave 
Jaws of the colonies, there is no me- 
dium in the scale of punishments, 
when inflicted by judgment of law, 
between thirty-nine lashes of the 
cart-whip, and mutilation, banish- 
ment, or death; and ten or twelve 
lashes are in general held an ade- 
quate punishment for common 
domestic offences— at least by mer- 
ciful masters. The meliorating acts, 
as they are called, for the protec- 
tion of slaves, have in this respect 
attempted, or affected to controul 
the master's authority; and the acts 
of the Leeward Islands already re- 
ferred to, in the fourteenth section, 
has enacted. That if any person 
shall " crpelly whip" his slave, he 
shall be liable to an indictment in 
the superior court of criminal juris- 
diction of the island, and, on con- 
viction, shall be punished by fine or 
imprisonment, or both, at the dis- 
cretion of the court. The slave, so 
cruelly whipped, is also, if it be 
thought necessary for his protec- 
tion, to be sold to another master. 

*' After these explanations, the 
nature of Mr. Muggins's conduct 
will be better understood. 

" Not content with gratifying his 
vengeance by punishment within 



14 

the bounds of his plantation, where 
he might have laughed at public 
justice, by suffiering none but slaves 
to witness his oppressions; he was 
resolved to shew his contempt of 
the law, and of the feelings of his 
more humane fellow-colonists, by 
making the public market-place of 
Charles- town, which is the seat of 
the insular courts and government, 
the theatre of a dreadful executior^ 
upon his unfortunate slaves. 

" Accordingly, on the 23d of 
January 1810, he went, attended by 
two of his sons, on horseback, with 
upwards of twenty of his devoted 
victims, men and women, in custody 
of the drivers, through the streets 
of Charles-town, to the market- 
place; and there proceeded to in- 
dulge his cruelty to the utmost, 
during more than two hours, in the 
face of day, and in the sight and 
hearing, not only of free persons 
but magistrates, who offered him no 
interruption. 

" To one negro man he gave, by 
the hands of expert drivers, no less 
than three hundred and sixty-five 
lashes; to another one hundred and 
fifteen ; to a third, one hundred and 
sixty-five; to a fourth, two hundred 
and fifty-two; to a fifth, two hun-' 
dred and twelve; to a sixth, one 
hundred and eighty-one; to a se- 
venth, one hundred and eighty se-* 
ven ; — to a woman, one hundred 
and ten ; to another, fifty-eight ; to 
a third woman, ninety-seven ; to a 
fourth, two hundred and twelve; 
to a fifth, two hundred and ninety- 
one ; to a sixth, eighty-three ; to, 
another eighty-nine ; — and to va- 
rious other women and men, various 
other cruel measures of the same 
punishment. 

"The poor sufferers were, of 
course, dreadfully cut and man- 
gled ; but they were conveyed to 
the plantation of their savage mas- 
ter, and attended by his surgeon, 
who, at his request, had been pre- 
sent at the execution, and who, 
though a justice of peace, had not 
interfered, as such, to prevent or 
forbid the crime. Bv his evidence, 



15 



at the trial which afterwards took 
place, it would appear that none of 
them died, though he admitted that 
many of them had suffered severely 
from fevers, the effects of their 
punishment. But by a subsequent 
account from the island, it appear- 
ed that one of the women, who was 
the most severely whipped, has died 
since the trial, or has since been 
discovered to be dead. Either this, 
or some other female sufferer, cried 
out during the whipping, that she 
was with child, but was disregarded, 
and her punishment went on. Among 
the circumstances of crueljy which 
have been mentioned, one of the 
drivers was brother to one of the 
men whom he was compelled to 
lacerate in the presence of the un- 
feeling master. 

" At the time of this outrage on 
humanity, public decency, and law, 
no less than seven magistrates were 
in Charles-town. Two of them, 
the Rev. William Green, who holds 
two livings in the island, and is a 
justice of the peace, and the Rev. 
Samuel Lyons, who also holds two 
livings there, and is a member of 
the council, were within bearing of 
the lash, and must have known of 
the cruel and illegal cause, yet did 
not at all interpose. The same has 
been already remarked of the sur- 
geon. Dr. Cassin. He admitted, 
at one of the trials which took place, 
that he was sent for by Mr. Hug- 
gins to attend in his professional 
character, and that having counted 
two hundred and thirty-six lashes 
given to one of the Negroes, he said 
he thought it was enough : but Mr. 
Huggins replied, he did not want 
his advice, unless he thought the 
man could bear no more ; on which 
he, the witness, retired. Another 
.justice of the peace, Mr. Edward 
Huggins, jun. was seen looking on 
at the execution the greatest part 
of the time. * 

'* But though some of the magis- 
tracy of the island were thus negli- 
gent of their duty, and appeared 
to regard the meliorating act, as 
all such acts, it is to be feared, are 



regarded in every island which lias 
passed them, viz. as laws never 
meant to be obeyed ; the House of 
Assembly at Nevis, to its honour, 
considered this transaction as one 
that they were bound in humanity, 
and from regard to the credit of the 
colony, publicly to reprobate, and 
to make the subject of legal inves- 
tigation. On the 31st of January, 
1810, eight days after the fact, they 
came to a resolution to that effect, 
which they ordered to be printed, 
and to be transmitted to England, 
and circulated throughout all the 
islands, together with the evidence 
laid before them as to the facts of 
the case. 

" The Council concurred in this 
resolution, except as to the printing 
and publishing the minutes ; but 
they had been published, previously 
to this opinion of the Council in the 
Gazette of St. Christopher, by or- 
der of the House of x-^ssembly. 

" It should here be observed, 
that as there is no newspaper at 
Nevis, the Gazette of St. Christo- 
pher is the common organ of all 
olhcial publications by the Govern- 
ment of Nevis. 

" Perhaps to publish the evidence 
at all in that stage of the proceeding 
was premature ; but the Assembly 
seems to have thought that the 
audacious publicity and notoriety 
of the act demanded from them a 
public reprobation of it, lest it 
should redound to their own dis- 
grace, and be a subject of scandal in 
Europe. Whatever credit, however, 
the resolution may reflect on the 
individuals who passed it, the event 
has too well proved that the society 
in general does not deserve to share 
}a it. 

" An indictment was preferred, 
and found against Mr. Huggins, on 
the Act of the Leeward Islands 
before referred to; and early in 
May, 1810, it came on to be tried 
in the Court of King's Bench and 
Common Pleas at Nevis, when the 
facts, as here stated, were fully 
proved ; and indeed not disputed 
on the part of tiie defeudaat. H« 



^5 



contented himself with attempting 
to prove that the slaves had been 
disorderly ; but nothing like for«i- 
])le resistance to the master's aulho- 
rity, or even mutinous or disre- 
spectful language to him, or to any 
White person, was proved against 
them by any of his witnesses. The 
whole offent e brought home to them 
was, their absenting themselves 
from the estate at night, to avoid 
carrying out dung by moonlight ; 
and even in this offence some of the 
snlj'erers v.cre not implicated. One 
of them had only neglected his duty 
, as a watchman. 

" It may seem strange, after 
reading the act on v\hich the in- 
diciment was founded, that any 
t'vidence of this kind should be 
received, since no offence on the 
part of the slaves could justify the 
cruel conduct of the master. But 
it vviil be thought still stranger, 
perhaps, tlsat the defentiant's coun- 
sel should aruue to ihejuri/ againt 
thdr obligaiiGn to respect the act 
itself, speakivg; of it in the most 
eonieinptxions way, and intimating 
that it ivas passed merely to satisfy 
the clamours of some individaals in 
England, whom it ivas necessary 
to appease. Such, however, ap- 
pears to have been the nature of 
the defence; and the defence was 
effectual. Mr. Hnggins, after a 
short deliberation by the jury, was 
acquitted !!! 

" It jnay be thought that at least 
the offender will in future be dis- 
countenanced by the more respect- 
able members of the society. On 
the contrary, a party was making 
in his favour, to turn his opponents 
out of the Assembly, and place in 
their stead a majority who may 
expunge the resolution recorded 
against him : and, by the last ac- 
counts, two of his sons were just 
returned*. The President of the 

* These objects were fully accom- 
plished. Most of the members vvho had 
supported the resolution were turned 
out; and their place being supplied by 
the near relations or personal friends of 
Mr. Hnggins, the resolution was ex- 
punged from the Journals. . ' 



Council, being his son-in-law, is 
the less inexcusable for taking an 
active part on his behalf; and the 
influence of his own property and 
possessions in that small island 
is very considerable. But in the 
West Indies a master, prosecut- 
ed for the abuse of his power 
over his slaves, is always sure to 
iind zealous partizans in abun- 
dance, among the many who are 
conscious that the case may be 
their ov.n. 

*• Mr. Hnggins is so well aware 
of this, that he has not been content 
to stand on the defensive. He has 
prosecuted./in St. Christopher, the 
Printer of the Gazette in that island, 
for inserting the minutes sent to 
him by order of the Assembly; 
and the prosecution has been so po- 
pularthere, that one jury staid out 
of court a long time (it is said three 
days) because they could not agree 
in finding the defendant not guilty^ 
though satisfied of his innocence 
in i)oint of intention. 

"A juror at length was with-, 
drawn, and a second trial after- 
wards had, when the following 
verdict was found : * Guilty of 
publishing a libel, issued by the 
House of Assembly of Nevis, under 
a mistaken opinion that it was not 
a libel, and that the authority of 
that body justified his publishing 
their resolutions.' 

" The Printer was sentenced to 
a month's imprisonment, and to 
find bail to keep the peace for 
three years." 

The above statement was con- 
firmed in all its parts by papers 
which were laid on the table of the 
House of Commons in the sessioti 
of 1811, and in a more particular 
manner by the notes of evidence, 
taken during the trial by the coun- 
sel employed, not only for the pro- 
secutor, but for the defendant ; the 
letters of Governor Elliot to the 
Earl of Liverpool ; and the let- 
ters of the late J. W. Tobin, Esq- 
a planter of Nevis, to the Go- 
A^ernor. _ . .- . , - . -.- -^ -^ 



17 



It ought to be known, that to 
the exertions of the gentleman 
who has just been mentioned, 
Mr. Tobin, it is owing, that these 
atrocious proceedings attracted the 
notice of government and the pub- 
lic. Mr. Tobin was himself a 
West-Indian planter; but he had 
nobly emancipated himself from 
those shackles of prejudice by 
which most around him continued 
to be bound ; and he dared to be 
singular enough to advocate, in a 
West-Indian colony, the cause of 
the oppressed Negro. To his last- 
ing praise be it recorded, that he 
spared no pains, and scrupled no 
sacrifice of personal ease and 
comfort, to bring to light and to 
punishment the above atrocities; 
and though assailed, as might have 
been expected, with slanders, as 
well as with threats of legal pro- 
secution, he continued to pursue 
the same honourable course, until 
death deprived the world of his 
invaluable services. 

The House of Commons' papers 
contain letters from Mr. Tobin to 
Governor Eiliot, on the subject of 
Huggins's conduct, of which the 
following are extracts. 

" Coming from a country where 
the fountains of justice still remain 
pure, and the liberty of the press 
is respected, your Excellency must, 
I am persuaded, on your arrival 
here, have experienced the same 
feelings of surprise and indigna- 
tion, which the respectable part of 
this community did, en hearing a 
VERDICT of ACQUITTAL pro- 
nounced against one of the actors 
in that bloody scene ! The evi- 
dence on the trial was still stronger 
than in the affidavits; for it ap- 
peared, not only that several of the 
Negroes received more than two 
hundred lashes, but that a still se- 
verer torture was inflicted on one 
of them, by the continued applica- 
tion of two cart -whips, to make 
him confess what he persevered in 
declaring he was ignorant of; and 
this was sworn to by two resj)f;clable 
witnesses. One of the women re- 



ceived two hundred and ninety-two 
lashes. She is still alive! But 
another, of a weaker frame, and 
whosepunishmentwasfar less,died, 
after a lingering illness, the 22d 
of June last. Had they all died, 
the act by which they suffered be- 
ing, according to the declaration 
of that jury, a legal act, the authors 
of it would have been perfectly 
GUILTLESS ; and every overseer 
in the country, however ignorant 
or brutal, left at full liberty to whip, 
mutilate,anddestroy,at his pleasure, 
the slaves committed to his charge. 
But, fortunately, the verdict of a 
jury makes no precedent in law ; 
and CRUELTY, by the English 
law, which is in full force here, i* 
still cruelty. It was not defined 
by our ancestors, or its limits mark- 
ed out by line and compass, but 
left to the heart of man to deter- 
mine : and deeply it is to be lament- 
ed, that in this small community 
such an appeal is found insuffi- 
cient. 

" Mr. Huggins, the author of 
these evils, when I was here sixteen 
years ago, was then as distinguished 
for his cruelty as in the present 
day, and his conduct held in ab- 
horrence by every good man in the 
community ; and by no one more 
than by Mr. Cottle, since become 
his son-in-law, neither deficient 
himself in understanding or human- 
ity. Mr. John Stanley, late attor- 
ney-general for these islands, some 
years since, assured my father, 
that he was examined before a com- 
mittee of the House of Common* 
respecting a murder committed by 
Mr. Iluggins, who has not scrupled 
to acknowledge to a friend, that 
he shot a Negro. It was understood 
at the time, that the body had been 
thrown into a negro hut, and burnt 
with it. An inquest was taken on 
the body of another Negro, who 
died shortly after a most inhuman 
flogging; but the overseer, who is 
still in the island, refused to give 
any satisfactory evidence to the 
grand jury who examined him. Two 
wretched suicides, weary of life and 



18 

the sufferings they endured, have 
been taken out of a cistern with 
their chains about them. Not whips 
and chains alone, but iron collars 
armed with spikes, have been used, 
and I believe still are, as instruments 
of punishment by this man. Igno- 
rant and brutal as he is, he has 
amassed an immense fortune, and 
still is grasping at the possession 
of more and more Negroes. His 
doctrine was, that it was cheaper 
to huy Negroes than to breed them. 
He has publicly boasted of five at- 
tempts against his life by poison ; 
and there are medical men who 
well know the facts. In the 
first six months after he took 
possession of the estate called Pin- 
iiings, nine Negroes died without 
any epidemic disease. A wretched 
old woman came to me a few days 
ago, to tell me she was compelled 
to work in the field. She was a 
favourite house negro in her for- 
mer master's family, and had 
nursed one of his children. Being 
ordered to throw a mixture of gun- 
powder and salt water on the man- 
gled bodies of the Negroes whipped 
in the market-place, she refused, 
ami incurred the displeasure of 
her master; and her intellects have 
since been evidently disordered. 
An English groom, who had been 
witness to many of these shocking 
scenes, quitted the estate with hor- 
ror, and returned to England, where 
his testimony will have some weight, 
as he bears a vefy good character. 
The Negro, Fanny,who died, had not 
been accustomed to hard work for 
many years before Mr. H. got pos- 
session of the estate : but he put her 
into the field, and she was one of 
those ordered to carry out dung by 
night. She never worked viiih the 
hoe again after the whipping, and 
died of an atrophy. Of the three 
who composed the jury on the iu- 
quest, two were on the jury which 
acquitted Mr. Huggins ; and the 
coroner was one of the magistrates, 
%vho, with unconcern, beheld the 
flogging in the market place. This 
iu<juest was never returned to the 



Secretary's office, as is usual, atid 
was not to be found when called 
for by the grand jury, who, fortu- 
nately for the country, did not pre- 
sent either of the Mr. Muggins's, or 
we should have winessed a trial 
more scandalous than the last." 

A letter accompanied these heart- 
sickening communications from the 
Earl ofLiverpool to Governor Elliot, 
in which he stated, that the narrative 
of Mr. Muggins's unparalleled seve- 
rity had made the deepest impres- 
sion on the minds of his Majesty's 
Government. " It might have been 
hoped," observes Lord L. "that the 
fear of disgrace attendant on an 
outrage of humanity, so publicly ex- 
hibited, would have been sufficient, 
in any civilized country, for its pre- 
vention ; but it never could have 
been supposed possible that so fla- 
grant a violation of the clause of the 
actjCalled the MeliorationAct,could 
be submitted to the cognizance of a 
court of justice, and be exempted 
from the punishment which the 
judge is empowered to inflict on con- 
viction of the offender." Had hisi 
Lordship passed a few years in the 
West Indies, and been acquainted 
with the interior structure ofaWest- 
Indian community, his surprize 
would have been somewhat differ- 
ently placed. It would have been ex- 
cited by the novel circumstance of art 
accuser and prosecutor having been 
found there, bold enough to unveil 
such a transaction, rather than by 
the impunity which has attended it. 
The view which Governor Elliot 
took of the subject, in a letter which 
was at the same time laid on the 
table of the House of Commons, is 
exceedingly just. The root of the 
evil, he remarks, lies deeper than in 
the remissness or culpability of the 
individ uals who conduct the govern- 
ment of those islands ; and he repre- 
sents it as originating in the very 
frame of society. The acquirement* 
of education among the White inha- 
, bitauts, consisting of " managers, 
overseers, self-created lawyers, 
self-educated physicians, and ad- 
venturous merchants, with little real 



id 



eapital arid scanty credit, are very 
unequal to the task of taking a 
share in tiie government." And be 
it renjerabeied, tliat to this class, so 
constituted and so qualified, the 
most important functions of govern- 
ment are entrusted. " The pre- 
valence: of principle, either moral 
or religious, is also (he fears) not to 
be fairly calculated from the repe- 
tition ot the hackneyed expressions, 
of which an ostentatious use is fre- 
quently made in addresses, and on 
all occasions meant to meet the 
public eye at home. To collect 
from such a state of society," con- 
tinues the Governor, " men^fit to be 
legislators, judges, or jurymen, is 
perfectly impracticable." 

" The case of Mr. Huggins," 
the Governor observes; " the seve- 
rity of his conduct towards a num- 
ber of his slaves ; the remissness of 
the magistrates in having allowed 
so disgraceful a transaction to take 
place in the public market-place, 
without interfering to stop or 
prevent it ; the legal proceedings 
which have since ensued both 
at Nevis and St. Cristophers, and 
which have occasioned great dissa- 
tisfaction, were some of the circum- 
stances which bore on my mind 
when I expressed to your Lord- 
ship, generally, my doubts of the 
inefficiency oj the civil institutions, 
as ihty now exist in the other is- 
lands, for the purposes of admini- 
stering justice, or for carrying 
into effect any sentence of law that 
might he opposed, either by the in- 
Jluence of a powerful i?idividual, or 
by the spirit of party." 

" It is indeed difficult to con- 
ceive by what pervei'sion of human 
reason, and still more by what per- 
version of human feeling, any jury 
could have given a verdict of ac- 
quittal for punishments in the 
course of which, 1 believe, it ap- 
peared on incontrovertible evi- 
dence that three hundred lashes of 
cartwhips, or nearly that number, 
had been inflicted in the public 
market place, without the sentence 
of a magistrate, upon a considera- 



ble proportion of a gang of thirty- 
two Negroes, who were all more or 
less severely punished, without hav- 
ing been convicted of any act which, 
by the most forced construction, 
could be deemed mutinous, or dan- 
gerous to the community at large. 
The problem is therefore, I fear, 
only to be solved by confirming the 
melancholy statement I have made 
in the outset of this dispatch, of 
the unworthy and inadequate mate^ 
rials which constitute those tribu- 
7ials so improperly styled Courts 
of Justice in several of the West 
Indies." 

Lord Liverpool, with an expres 
sion of becoming indignation, con- 
veyed to Governor Elliot the com- 
mands of the Prince Regent, to re- 
move from their honourable situa- 
tion, any magistrates who actually 
witnessed the atrocities of Mr. Hug- 
gins without interference, and who 
have no better justification of their 
conduct to allege, than ignorance of 
the duties attached to their office; 
and he desired that this might be 
done "with that degree of publi- 
city that may mark to the com- 
munity to which they belong, his 
Royal Iligiiness's reprobation of 
such culpable remissness on their 
part." 

But in what manner has the com- 
munity of Nevis responded to the 
sentimentsthus authoritatively pro- 
mulged by the Prince Regent and 
his Ministers? Have the actors in 
this bloody tragedy sustained any 
discredit among their neighbours, 
in consequence of the stigma which 
was thus athxed to them? Quite 
the reverse. They have since par- 
ticipated largely in the highest ho- 
nours vAiidi their fellow-colonists 
could bestow. The Assembly of 
Nevis consists of only fifteen mem- 
bers: Mr. Huggins and two of his 
sons have been elected members of 
that body by the free choice of their 
vicinage, and their influence in the 
island is absolutely paramount. 
The universal indignation of the 
British public, and the marked re- 
probation of the Prince Regent, ap- 



20 



pear to have clothed them with a 
kind of sanctity, as martyrs in the 
colonial cause. The conduct of 
Mr. Huggins which, in this country, 
has rendered his name a by-word 
of reproach, and the defence of 
which has been prudently aban- 
doned even by the West-Indian 
party among us, seems only to have 
raised him to a higher elevation in 
the regards of the resident planters 
of Nevis; while those. wlio endea- 
voured to bring him to punishment 
became the objects of general dis- 
trust and obloquy. 

But what, it will be asked, is the 
remedy which it is in the power of 
Parliament to apply to the admitted 
evils of the West-Indian system 1 
Has not the mother country resign- 
ed to her colonies, by formal acts, 
the right of interior legislation ; 
and does not the case of America 
furnish a practical and conclusive 
illustration of the danger of inter- 
ference with such a right? We re- 
ply, that the contest with America 
was a contest respecting taxation, 
and not legislation. If we were to 
admit in the fullest extent, that the 
population of every British colony 
inherited an exclusive right to tax 
themselves, yet no such right of 
legislating for themselves can be 
inferred from the principles of the 
British constitution, and still less 
from the universal usage in similar 
cases. In truth, the laws of Great 
Britain are, ipso facto, the laws of 
every British colony, until either 
by Charter, or by Act of Parliament, 
a power of local legislation is con- 
ferred upon it, or rather delegated 
to it. It hardly requires an argu- 
ment to shew, that if this power 
should be systematically abused to 
purposes directly at variance with 
those for which it was conferred ; 
if instead of being employed for the 
only legitimate ends of all govern- 
ment—the protection of subjects. 



and the maintenance of their just 
rights by an equal and impartial ad- 
ministration of the laws — it is made 
the instrument of subjecting to 
degradation, and wretchedness, and 
oppression, nine-tenths at least of 
the whole mass of the population; 
it then becomes the indispensable 
duty of those who have too rashly 
delegated such a power, to inquire 
into its misapplication, and, if some 
less summary remedy does not pro- 
mise to be efficacious, even to annul 
the grant. Is it to be endured that 
the live hundred White inhabitants 
of Nevis, for example, shall com- 
bine to reduce to the condition of 
brute beasts about ten thousand of 
their fellow-subjects; and, though 
depending on the naval and military 
force of the mother country for 
the means of safety from revolt, 
shall yet question the right ot Par- 
liament, even to take cognizance of 
their internal administration, how- 
ever flagrantly unjust and oppres- 
sive it may be proved to be ; be- 
cause, forsooth, they have, at some 
time or other, received what they 
choose to call a British Constitu- 
tion? The charters, or consti- 
tutions, given to the difi'erent 
islands, expressly stipulate that no- 
thing shall be enacted by their legis- 
latures; and therefore, by inference, 
that nothing shall be in force as 
law, which is inconsistent with the 
laws of England. On this ground 
alone, there is not a single charter 
granted to a West-Indian colony 
which has not been forfeited; for 
there is not a single colony in 
which the gift of what is called a 
British Constitution has not been 
employed as the means of establish- 
ing a system of tyranny and des- 
potism, not merely alien from the 
liberal spirit of British legislation, 
but revolting to every feeling of 
common humanity.

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c. 



Our next Sketch will afford a far- 
ther exemplification of ihe feelings 
of the West-Indian aristocracy to- 
wards the Negro lace. The first 
incident which shall be detailed is 
drawn, not from the insulated acts 
of any private individual, but from 
the proceedings of the criminal 
judicature of the colony of Dema- 
rara. 

On the 2oth of May, 1796, Dr. 
Pinckard thus writes from that co- 
lony :— 

" Among the distressful scenes it 
has lately been my lot to witness, 
I chanced to be at Stabroek a few 
mornings ago, at the time of the 
execution of the captain of the 
Bush-negroes whom I mentioned to 
you in a former letter*. He died 
faithful to his cause, and no infor- 
mation could be obtained from hira 
regarding the encampment said to 
be still remaining in the woods. 
He was sentenced to be suspended 
by the neck for a short time, and 
then taken down, while yet alive, 
to have his head severed from his 
body. The executioner was a 
Negro, who, without any feelings 
of compunction, or of sorrow for 
his countryman, exulted in the 
adroitness with which he took off 
the head at a single blow. 

" After the execution,! sat a short 
time with the officers, at the bar- 
rack of the 99lh regiment; when 
another painful scene was exhibit- 
ed lo our observation, in the Hog- 
ging of a party of Negroes, before 
the fiscal's door, upon the public 
street. 

" On one of them being released 
from the stakes, to which he had 
* Sec Firit Sketch, p. «. 



been tied down, with his face to 
the earth, during his punishment, 
I thought that I recognised his 
features, and, upon going out to 
ascertain the fact, discovered him 
to be one of the carpenters, who 
had been set apart to work, under 
ray direction, at the hospital. It 
happened, too, that he had distin- 
guished himself by his industry, 
and was the man with whom I had 
most conversed, on account of his 
speaking English, and being able 
to explain my instructions to his 
fellow-workmen. 

"You will believe that I felt an 
interest regarding him, and that 
I was anxious to learn by what of- 
fence he had brought upon himself 
the severe punishment which we 
had witnessed. To this end, in 
company with Major Say and other 
officers, I followed the bleeding 
slave to his home, where we learn- 
ed that the alleged crime, for which 
he had been punished, was 
striking a White man ; although, in 
fact, it appeared to have been a 
refusal to get up from his bed, at 
nine o'clock at night, to work for 
an European inhabitant of the 
town, after labouring at the hos- 
pital during the whole of the day. 
It was further hinted by those 
about him, that something of pique 
or prejudice, on account of the 
poor man expressing himself pleased 
with his employment at the British 
hospital, might possibly have ope- 
rated in deafening the ear of justice 
against hira. 

" A Dutchman who chanced to be 
present at the time we were making 
inquiries, in the carpenter's shop 
to which the Negro belonged, told 

D2 



24 



us, with an air of confidence, that 
he had been punished for striking 
him, and catting his elbow with a 
large chisel; shewing us the very 
instrument with which the wound 
had been made, and the precise 
spot whereon the oftcnce had been 
commilted — at the same time exhi- 
biiing his arm supported in a sling. 
All this being so circumstantially 
stated, four of us, Major Say, the 
siirgeonof the 99lh, another officer, 
and myself, begged to see this 
frightful wound which had been 
cut in the elbow. Some objections 
were offered, on the ground of dis- 
turbing the dressings, unsewing the 
bandages, and the like: but as Mr. 
Blackader promised to replace all 
these in fit order, we persisted in 
the request; and the Dutchman, 
finding that we were urgent, and 
rather inclined to be peremptory, 
at length submitted : but the coat 
was said to fit inconveniently tight, 
the shirt sleeve to be tied in a hard 
knot, and other little difficulties 
and delays were thrown in the way. 
Still we determined to subdue them 
all ; and when, at last, we suc- 
ceeded, lo ! instead of the many 
bandages, and complex dressings 
which we had been taught to ex- 
pect, we could neither find a 
plaster, nor the wound. Instead 
of a deep cut from a chisel, a slight 
bruise only appeared upon the 
elbow, the skin being neither cut 
uor broken. This strengthened 
our suspicions that the slave had 
been unfairly treated ; and bypro 
secuting the inquiry, we learned 
the following history . 

"The Dutchman had gone to the 
carpenter's shop in the evening, in 
search of a carpenter to do some 
work at a house in the tovin; and 
finding this Negro sleeping in the 
room over the workshop, ordered 
him to get up and accompany him. 
The poor fellow pleaded that it 
was night, that he had toiled 
through the whole of the day, aiid 
further that he was directed, by 
the commandant, to work only at 
the hospital, until that was com- 



pleted. The Dutchman, neverthe- 
less, insisted upon his going. The 
slave unhappily refused. Words 
ensued ; and the White man, 
seizing the Black by the hair of 
his head, dragged him down into 
the workshop; where, in the scuffle, 
the Dutchman ha|»pened to receive 
a bruise of the elbow. 

" The following morning a com- 
plaint was made to a public officer, 
high in power, stating that the 
Negro had struck the Dutchman, 
and wounded him ; and it being an 
offence utterly unpardonable for a 
Black man, ' under any circttm- 
sfances, to lift his hand against a 
White one, the miserable slave was 
sentenced, without further inquiry, 
to receive the punishment we had 
witnessed. 

" We could not feel satisfied that 
the proceedings had been conduct- 
ed with a due regard to justice : 
we therefore waited upon the per- 
son who had decreed the punish- 
ment, to inquire more into the 
merits of the case ; and were told 
by him, that the Negro had been 
punished * for striking a White 
man, with a heavy stick, and a 
large nail in it, and therewith cut- 
ting a deep wound in his elbow.' 
As this account differed from that 
of the Dutchman himself, we asked 
this man of power, if the sentence 
had been pronounced barely upon 
the man's own report. Certainly 
not, he replied ; the deposition was 
also sanctioned by the testimony 
of four respectable witnesses, who 
appeared in evidence, having seen 
the Negro strike the White man 
with the great stick with a great 
nail in it. 

" We then used the freedom of 
asking, if he had taken the trouble 
to look at this wounded elbow him- 
self. He had, he said ; • and a 
sad cut it was.' If we had not 
been stricken dumb with the reply, 
we might have exclaimed, 'Alas! 
unhappy Blacks ! what hope have 
ye of justice, if not only private^ 
but also public punishments be thus 
awardedV 



25 



*'As soon as our surprise and 
indignation would permit, we in- 
formed this man of equity, \h^\ four 
of us had minutely examined this 
frightful cut of the elbow, and that, 
with all our eight eyes strained as 
wide as they could stare, we had 
not even been able to discover the 
wound ; adding, for his further in- 
formation, that the Dutchman had, 
himself, assured us tiiat it was cut 
with a large chisel : but that, in 
fact, it had neither been cut with 
a chisel, nor with a nail in a stick, 
nor cut at all; being only a slight 
bruise which had probably hap- 
pened in the struggle, when the 
Dutchman was pulling about the 
Negro by the hair of his head. 
We also ventured to add, that the 
whole tale of this mighty wound 
was a scandalous imposition; and 
the punishment which had been 
inflicted upon the Negro a gross 
injustice. We then appealed to 
this arbitrary guardian of the laws, 
very earnestly demanding whether, 
in justice to the injured Negro, to 
the public, and to himself, who 
had been thus imposed upon, he 
would not feel it incumbent upon 
him to institute an inquiry regard- 
ing the fact, and to have the cruel 
wretch, and his four perjured wit- 
nesses, severely punished ! Of 
course, we made no remark upon 
his having seen the sad cut in the 
elbow wilh his own eyes! Whether 
from feeling himself implicated, or 
from a reluctance arising out of 
any other cause, this great officer 
oi justice did not seem to be of 
accord with our sentiments upon 
the subject; but endeavoured to 
divert us from the question by 
expatiating upon the paramount 
necessity of holding slaves in sub- 
jection, and the great danger and 
impolicy of overlooking, in any 
in-ilance, the crime of their lifting 
the hand against a White man. We 
readily conceded to him that, upon 
the present system, it was abso- 
luiely necessary to be tenacious 
of the privileges assumed, but we 
could never a^iec that il was either 



just or wise to punish an unpro- 
tected man upon the false accu- 
sation of a set of perjured wretches, 
merely because nature had covered 
him with a dark skin, and them 
with fair ones ; nor that it was fit 
not to expose such wanton malice 
to public shame, whenever the 
falsehood and injustice of the tes- 
timony should be detected. There- 
fore, pledging ourselves to appear 
in evidence, whenever called upon, 
we left the office, obtaining a pro- 
mise from this man of power, to 
institute an inquiry, and to have 
justice done to the poor injured 
slave ! 

" Whether our endeavours in his 
behalf may be crowned with suc- 
cess, is extremely doubtful, but the 
unhappy history of our carpenter's 
punishment will convey to you 
some idea of the kind of justice to 
be expected by slaves. The alleged 
offender is not heard in mitigation, 
nor are any of his colour admitted 
in evidence, although they might 
be able wholly to disprove the 
charge ; hence, whenever a White 
man is base enough to perjure him- 
self in accusation, the Negro can 
have no hope of escaping from pu- 
nishment." 

Let the reader call to mind, that 
it was one of the criminal judges 
of this very colony, Mr. J. Clayton 
Jenyns, who, in November 1815, 
published in the Colonial Gazette, 
with the sanction of his na/ne, and 
in an address to the planters of 
Deaiarara, his deliberate opinion, 
" that the authority of the master 
over his Negroes is not to be en- 
cumbered wilh official formalities ;" 
" that his power cannot without 
danger be brought into doubt or 
discussion, and should never be 
opposed or thwarted by any inter- 
mediate authority." — Let the reader 
call this to mind, and then let him 
judge whether the adminisi ration 
of justice, as between master and 
slave, is likely to iiave undergone 
any material improvement in lliat 
colony. 

From the commencement of the 



26 



Abolition-controversy in 1787, to 
the present hour, the colonial party 
have been in the habit of trium- 
phantly adducing the testimony of 
officers of high rank, admirals and 
generals, who have served in the 
West Indies, in favour of the mild- 
ness and humanity of their system. 
Had Dr. PincUard's acquaintance 
with that system been of the same 
superficial nature with theirs ; had 
he known the West Indies only by 
the hospitalities he experienced 
during the first weeks of his resi- 
dence at Barbadoes, we might 
have expected from him a si- 
milar testimony. Dr. Pinckard, 
however, was not satisfied with 
first impressions. He was deter- 
mined to judge for himself; and, ex- 
ercising a proper diflSdence in the 
fforce of interested logic or the ac- 
curacy of ex parte assertions, to rely 
only on the evidence of facts. What 
a different view might have been 
given of the very transaction which 
is narrated above, but for the in- 
trepid and persevering curiosity 
of Dr. Pinckard! And in what a 
light does the result of his humane 
interposition place the good faith 
and justice of the parties concern- 
ed ; not merely of the unfeeling 
complainant, but of the judge com- 
missioned by his Majesty, and 
bound by his oath, to dispense im- 
partial justice! Does not such a 
fact countervail a hundred general 
declarations in favour of the colo- 
nial system? 

But it may be supposed that 
^Deniarara forms an opprobrious 
exception from the claims of the 
other colonies to the praise of hu- 
manity and justice in the admi- 
nistration of their slave code. Let 
the reader turn to the Sketch im- 
mediateh preceding, for a striking 
proof of the impunity with which 
the most express enactments in fa- 
vour of the slave may be openly 
and contumeliously set at nought 
by masters, in the confidence 
doubtless (a confidence which in 
'thi§ instance proved to be but too 
^)^]b|1 fpiind^^d) thpt a, jury of plant- 



ers would act in the spirit of the 
principles of Fiscal Jenyns, and 
of the conduct of his predecessor 
as now detailed ; and deem it dan- 
gerous to interfere between master 
and slave. 

Let him turn also to a paper of 
Remarks on the late Insurrection at 
Barbadoes, p. 13. for an illustration 
of the condition of the slaves in that 
island, the very oldest of our co- 
lonies, as it respects legal pro- 
tection. 

A farther illustration of their 
state in this respect will be found 
in the following anecdote, extracted 
from Dr. Pinckard's work. The 
narrative is contained in a letter 
from Barbadoes, dated in March, 
1796. And let it not be forgotten 
that it was in Bridgetown, the ca- 
pital of that island, the seat of its 
government, that the occurrence 
took place. 

" I witnessed a scene of cruelty, 
which strongly exemplified the ab- 
ject and wretched condition to 
which human beings are subjected 
in a life of slavery. It happened 
that I was waiting upon the quay 
for the Lord Sheffield's boat, when 
two men, apparentlyWhite Creoles, 
came up, and seized a Negro, who 
was standing near me, accusing him 
of having run away from his master. 
The poor Black assured them, that 
he had no master; that he belong- 
ed to Mrs. ; that he was well 

known in the town; and that they 
must, certainly, have mistaken his 
person ! Upon these grounds he 
strongly urged the impropriety of 
their taking him to prison: but, 
regardless of his remonstrances, 
and of their own error, I hey tied 
him with a thick cord, fastened hiis 
hands, and forced him towards the 
place of confinement! Curiosity 
led me to follow them. The pobr 
man still pleaded his innocence, 
and the wrong they had committed, 
begging and praying to be allowed 
to refer them to his mistress, or to 
another family in the town, to iden- 
tify his person. Heedless of biS 
protestations and entreaties, they 



27 
still dragged him on ; and from 
his only expressing a reluctance 
at being thus, unjustly, hurried to 
a prison, one of these hardened 
wretches struck him a violent blow 
on the head, with a large stick, 
calling out to the other, in broad 
Barbadoes accent, and with a great 
oath, ' Cut him d \vn.' 

" A little before they reached the 
prison they had to pass a doorway 
where there happened to be a 
strong light, by means of which one 
of these cruel instruments of the 
law of force instantly recognised 
the poor ill-treated slave, and find- 
ing that they were actually guilty 
of the mistake which the Negro 
Iiad stated, he called out to his 
savase comrade, who had struck 
the helpless Black upon the head, 

* I know the fellow : we must let 
him go:' upon which, they both, 
with dreadful imprecations, order- 
ed him to stand, without stirring, 
whilst they should untie him ; and, 
upon his only moving his arm to 
expedite the loosening of the cord, 
they swore, that if he dared * to 
ttir, or look savage,' they would 

* cut him down,' or put him * di- 
rectly into prison/ Such was the 
compensation dealt him for the 
unjust and cruel treatment which 
he had already received. The 
wretches not only dragged the 
unoffending slave to a prison, in 
defiance of his solemn assurances 
of their having erroneously seized 
him, and without allowing him an 
appeal to any one who knew his 
person, but, because he ventured 
to say they were committing an 
error, had the inhumanity to strike 
him wilh a force sufficient to have 
fractured his skull, and to threaten 
him with the further severity of 
death, or a dungeon, should he 
dare only to cast a look of dis- 
pleasure*. 

" What must have been the feel- 
ings of this injured man! who, after 

• We are told, on Barbadian autho- 
rity, that at the present moment the 
slaves are guilty of the crime of looking 
tiUkjf. 



being abused and maltreated, was 
put in fear of his life, if he should 
only permit nature to assume her 
seat on his brow, — if the cruelty, 
pain, and injustice which he had 
suffered, should only cause a mark 
of disapprobation to appear upon 
his countenance ! But nature, how- 
ever proscribed, was not to be 
restrained by such command ! 
While the power of memory re- 
mains to me I can never — never 
forget the indignant, but hopeless, 
expression of injury which over- 
spread the features of this poor 
slave, as he retired ! He felt ag- 
grieved, and was conscious that 

he had no remedy, — no 

appeal !" 

And yet, after all this, West In- 
dians do not scruple to tell us, that 
the condition of the Negro Slave 
in the West Indies is preferable to 
that of the labouring classes in 
Europe ; and they hope to delude 
us by such bold misrepresenta- 
tions. But let us look to the facts 
of the case, and not to their hardy 
affirmations. We willingly concede 
to them, indeed, that a humane 
master, residing on his estate, has 
it in his power to promote in a 
very high degree the comfort and 
happiness of his slaves. Dr. Pinc- 
kard exhibits a beautiful picture of 
what such a master may effect, in 
the case of a plantation in Berbice, 
at that time the property of Mr. 
Dougan, a distinguished philanthro- 
pist ; and we doubt not that other 
similar instances might be found 
within the West-Indian Archipe- 
lago. When they occur, they shine 
the brighter from their contrast 
with the surrounding gloom: they 
deserve to obtain the highest meed 
of praise, and to be held up to 
universal imitation. 

But, alas! how often do even 
these rare examples of beneficent 
rule tend, in the present state of 
things, to aggravate the evils of 
servitude ! By this ameliorated 
treatment, the habit is broken of 
enduring the usual hardships of 
that condition of life ; and the slave 



28 



passing, in the ordinary course of 
things, from a humane and consi- 
derate, to a severe or even ordi- 
■ nary master, has to undergo a new 
seasoning, even more destructive 
than the first process which has 
usually borne that name. His spi- 
rits sink under the transition, and 
the body supports it with still more 
difficulty than the mind. 

Dr. Pinckard had not been long 
enough in the West indies to wit- 
ness the deplorable consequences 
of such reverses. He would other- 
wise, perhaps, have seen, in the sin- 
gular happiness of Mr. Dougan's 
plantation, an aggravation of those 
evils which it appears at first sight 
to extenuate. He saw enough, how- 
ever, of the fragility of human life in 
the West Indies — not to mention the 
great instability of West-Indian pos- 
sessions — to lead him to reflect, that 
a very short time might give an 
owner of a different spirit, or, what 
might be almost as dangerous to 
the happiness of the Negroes, a new 
manager, to this plantation. Nor, 
even in the case we are contem- 
plating, is this a mere supposition, 
but a sad reality. Soon after Dr. 
Pinckard quitted the colony, this 
very plantation and its slaves met 
the ordinary fate of such property. 
Its benevolent proprietor died. The . 



estate passed into other hands; and 
all distinctive traces of its former 
admired management soon melted 
down into the dark unvarying line 
of colonial despotism. 

Let not such instances, then, as 
those of Mr. Dougan, even if they 
were less rare, prevent our examin- 
ing into the real nature and ten- 
dencies of our colonial bondage, as 
it exists both in law and in fact, 
with the view of applying a remedy 
to its evils. We cannot stand ac- 
quitted before God or our own 
consciences, if, after having had 
the enormities of this system un- 
veiled to our view, we satisfy our- 
selves with a few ineffectual wishes 
for its reformation. The Parlia- 
ment and people of England are 
bound to take measures for raising 
our fellow-subjects of the West 
Indies from their present state of 
degradation and suffering. The 
guilt of its unmitigated continuance 
will otherwise be theirs. Let them 
cause their voice to be distinctly 
heard, and the clamours of mis- 
taken selfishness and groundless 
prejudice, the arts of detraction, 
and the efforts of malevolence, will 
prove equally impotent in arresting 
the deliberate, but determinedj 
march of humanity andju8tice»

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c, 



1'he next Sketch shall be chiefly 
taken from papers which were laid 
on the table of the House of Com- 
Bions,. in 1812; some reference 
being also made to a pamphlet 
published at the same time (for 
Harding^ in St. James's-street), and 
entitled, " The Trial of Arthur 
Hodge, Esq. (late one of the Mem- 
bers of his Majesty's Council for 
the Virgin Islands)^ at the Island of 
Tortola, on the 25th April, 1811, 
and adjourned to the 29th of the 
same Mouth, for the Murder of his 
Negro Man Slave, named Prosper. 
Stenographically taken by A. M. 
Belisario, Esq. one of the Grand 
Jury who found the Bill of Indict- 
ment; and certified to be impartial 
and correct by R-icbard Hethering- 
ton, Esq.* President of the Virgin 
Islands, and President of the Court 
on the Trial." 

The facts sworn to in the differ- 
ent depositions, which led to the 
apprehension and trial of. Mr. 
Hodge, were, in substance, as fol- 
lows t : — 

1. In January^ 1806j a slave 
named Welcome, belonging to Mr. 
Hodge, was employed by him as a 
hunter, to go in quest of runaway 
slaves. After bunting for four or 
five days, he returned home unsuc- 

• This gentleman's attestation to the 
impartiality and correctness of Mr. Be- 
Knario's Report, together with that of 
William Gordon, Esq. Secretary to his 
Majesty's Council, and Clerk of the 
Crown for the Virgin Islands, is prefixed 
to the pamphlet.

turing to peruse the next fourteen para^

cessful ; in consequence of whicit 
he was laid down by Hodge's or- 
der, and severely cart-whipped. 
He wasimmediatefi/ sent out to hunf 
a second lime, and in a few days 
again returned unsuccessful — when^ 
with his old wounds uncured, he 
was a second time, by Hodge's or- 
der, laid down, and severely cart- 
whipped; Welcome was imme- 
diately sent out hunting a third 
time ; and returning in a few days> 
with the same success as before, he' 
was again severely cart-whipped 
by Hodge's order, and put in very 
heavy irons, with a pudding on 
each leg, and a crook round his 
neck ; and in the night-time was 
confined in the bilboes or stocks. 
He was at the same time allowed 
little or no food, and consequently 
became so weak that he could 
scarcely walk. In this condition,i 
with dreadful sores, occasioned by 
his former whippings, he was or- 
dered to gotoaneighbouringestatej 
but being unable to proceed, he fell 
down on the road, and, being car- 
ried home, he was again cart- 
whipped, and died in consequence 
the same night. 

2. Mr. Hodge having suspected 
two female slaves, Margaret his 
cook, and Else a washerwoman^ 
of a design to poison Mrs. Hodge 
and his children, he poured a quan- 
tity of boiling water down their 
throats; and having, after this, 
severely cart-whipped them and 
chained them together, he sent 
them, in a state of entire naked- 
nesSj to work in the field. Both 
these slaves languished for a short 
time in a miserable condition, and 
then died. On the d»y that Mar* 



32 



garet died, one of the deponents 
going into the kitchen, and ob- 
serving she was stupid, asked her 
what was the matter ; on which she 
pulled a handkerchief from her 
head, and shewed two very severe 
wounds, which, she said, Mr. Hodge 
had given her. She soon after fell 
OH her face, and, being carried to 
the sick-house, died that evening. 
Mr. Hodge had been heard to say, 
that he was resolved neither of 
these women should live long. 

3. Some time before the death of 
Margaret, one of the deponents 
saw, in the sick- house, a child about 
ten years of age, named Tamsen, 
with the skin entirely off. The 
deponent asked the sick-nurse what 
was the matter with the child ; but 
the sick-nurse refused to give an 
sjnswer, and seemed afraid, lest her 
master should know that the child 
had been seen. On inquiry, it ap- 
peared, that the child had been 
dipped, by Hodge's order, into a 
copper of boiling liquor. 

4. In the year 1807, a slave 
called Tom Boiler, a slout,^ hale, 
hearty man, was by Hodge's order, 
and in his presence, laid down and 
flogged without intermission, for at 
least an hour. After this infliction, 
he attempted to rise, but could 
not. He was taken up and carried 
to the sick-house, whence he never 
came out, but died in about a 
week. No doctor was called to 
attend him. 

5. Soon after the death of Tom 
Boiler, another slave named Pros- 
per, was by Hodge's order, and in 
his presence, laid down, and for 
Hiore than an hour cart-whipped 
without intermission. He was then 
taken up by Hodge's order, and, 
with his hands tied behind his 
back, lashed to a tree. Hodge 
then ordered the driver to use 
•* close quarters," — meaning by this 
expression a more cruel and se- 
vere cart-whipping than is ordina- 
rily used, the whip in this case be- 
ing shortened and going all round 
the body, cutting every part, par- 
ticularly the stomach and belly, 



and making at the same time coov- 
paratively little noise. In this si- 
tuation, Prosper was beaten till he' 
fainted ; his head hanging down 
backwards, and was no longer able 
to cry out. He was then carl^ied 
to the sick-house, where, within a 
fortnight, he died. 

6. A slave named Jupiter, about 
nineteen years of age, was, by 
Hodge's orders, severely cart-whip- 
ped, put in heavy irons, crook 
puddings, &c. and allowed little of 
nothing to eat. He was also burnt 
in the mouth with a hot iron. He 
shortly after died. 

7. On the 27th March, 1807, a 
new NegroSlave belonging toHodge 
was cart-whipped, in his master's 
presence, in the most cruel manner. 
He died in two or three days after. 
When his body was carried ottt on 
a board to be buried, it was seea 
by one of the witnesses in a shock- 
ingly lacerated state. 

8. A free man, named Peter,^ was 
hired by Hodge, as a cooper, at two 
joes per month. This man, though 
free, was repeatedly cart- whipped 
at close quarters, and in every other 
way, by order, and in the presence 
of Hodge, who also put chains upon 
him, and had him worked with the 
field Negroes. Peter soon died. 

9. In 1808, a young slave named 
Cuft'y, was by order of Hodge, and 
in his presence, severely and re* 
peatedly cart-whipped, chained! 
•fee. " He was cut to pieces," and 
had hardly any black skin remain- 
ing. After a cart-whipping, whicIS 
lasted upwards of an hour, he was 
carried to the sick-house, where he 
died within a week. 

10. Mr. Hodge frequently caused 
the childrenon his estate, about nine 
years of age, to be taken up by the 
heels, and dipped into tubs of water 
with their heads downwards, and 
kept there till stifled, then takeh 
out and suftered to recover and 
breathe, when they were again 
treated in the same manner, and so 
repeatedly, until they have been 
seen to stagger and fall. On this, 
Mr, Hodge has ordered them to b« 



taken np and suspended to a tree 
by their hands tied together, and 
iu this situation cart-whipped for 
some time at close quarters. — 
Among others, a Mulatto child, re- 
puted to be his own, named Bella, 
was repeatedly cart-whipped by his 
order; and he was also seen re- 
peatedly to strike the child with a 
stick on the head, so as to break 
her head ; and also to kick her so 
violently as to throw her several 
feet from him on the ground. 

11. A slave, named Cudjoe, a 
smart active fellow, was so severely 
and repeatedly cart-whipped and 
otherwise ill-treated by Hodge, that 
he died. Another slave, named 
Gift, who had also previously been 
in good health, after having been 
severely cart-whipped and chained, 
was again, with his wounds unheal- 
ed, subjected to a further severe 
cart-whipping, and died the same 
night. One of the deponents saw 
the body carried out for burial in 
a dreadful state of laceration. 

12. A Negro woman named Vio- 
let, belonging to Mr. Hodge, was 
confined and severely flogged and 
cut by him for the alleged crime of 
stealing candles. She died in con- 
sequence. A boy, a son of this 
woman, ran away through his mas- 
ter's flogging him. When brought 
back, he was put in chains, and so 
severely flogged that he died. One 
of the deponents saw the boy a 
week before he died, and per- 
ceived, from his swelled and lace- 
rated state, that he could not pos- 
sibly recover. 

13. A boy named Dick, whom 
Mr. Hodge charged with ha\ing 
Stolen his geese, was \erv oflcu flog- 
ged severely and in quick succession 
at close quarters and otherwise; iu 
consequence of which he died. He 
Lad also been put in chains, and had 
bis mouth burnt with a hot iron. 

14. One of the deponents, be- 
sides swearing to several of the 
above facts, stated, that for several 
years, during which the deponent 
resided on Mr. Hodge's estate, Mr. 
Uodge had been guilty of repeated 



and excessive acts of crnelty to* 
wards his slaves. Another depo- 
nent, who had lived, at different pe- 
riods, as a manager, on the estate 
of Mr. Hodge, called Belle Vue, and 
who was also a witness to many of 
the atrocities detailed above, swore, 
that at most of the very numerous 
and severe cart-whippings inflicted 
byMr.Hodgeon his slaves, the depo- 
nent was not actually present, Mr, 
Hodge generally choosing to inflict 
them without the presence of any 
competent witness; but that, in ad- 
dition to the instances of which he 
happened to be an eye-witness, and 
which are specified above, there 
were many others where he saw 
only the effects of Hodge's cruelty, 
in the laceration, burnt mouths, &c. 
of the slaves. He was satisfied these 
cruelties were inflicted by Hodge 
himself, as otherwise he should have 
heard him inquire, and complain, 
concerning these marks of sufteriug 
in his own Negroes.— It was scarce- 
ly possible to remain in the siek- 
bouse on account of the offensive 
smell proceeding from the corrupt- 
ed wounds of cart-whipped slaves. 
When this deponent first went to 
live on Hodge's state, there was 
upon it a fine gaag of upwards of 
a hundred able Negroes ; but wherji 
the last wife of Hodge died,in 1 808*, 
that number was so reduced by cru- 
elty, and absconding in consequence 
of cruelty, that Negroes enough 
were not to be found on the estate 
to dig her grave ; and thereforeJhe 
deponent and Daniel Ross, Esq. one 
of the magistrates who signed his 
deposition, assisted in digging it. 
He could not remember the names 
of all the Negroes who had died in 
consequence of the cruelties of 
Hodge ; but he knew the number 
to be great; sometimes three and 
four have died in the course of a 
day and night. On such occasions 
uo doctor was ever called in. He 
lived, in all, about three years with

u 



Mr.Hodjfffe; and in that time, he 
was satisfied that Hodge lost sixty 
Kegroes, at least, by the severity 
ofnis punishments; and he believed 
ihat only one Ne«:ro died a natural 
death during the same period. 

Such then were the dreadful facts 
of this case. On their being brought 
before Governor Elliot, he imme- 
diately issued a special commission 
for the trial of the offender. The 
trial took placeon the 29th of April, 
and lasted from ten in the morning 
till half piast five on Jhe morning of 
tbeSoth. The jury, after delibe- 
rating for two hours, brought in a 
verdict of Guilty, on the first indict- 
rae;nt, which was for the murder of 
Projsper ; (there were eight other 
indictments in reserve); and sen- 
tence of death being passed upon 
him, he was executed on the 8th of 
May.— But this is not all which ap- 
pears on the face of the parliamen- 
tary papers ; and if we were to stop 
here, ^dreadful as the details have 
been, it would give but a very in- 
adeqviate idea of the real nature of 
this singular case. 

It appears, then, that Mr. Hodge 
h^d been perniitted for years to 
proceed in his course of whole- 
sale murder, not only with perfect 
impunity, but even without inquiry. 
And yet there was not a magistrate, 
nor a man, in that small island, to 
whom his shocking barbarity was 
not a matter of notoriety. At 
length, in consequence of some 
violent personal quarrels combined 
Hith party animosities, he was ar- 
raigned for murders committed four 
or five years before. But for these 
violent dissensions, his conduct 
tivQuld probably never have become 
the subject of legal investigation. 
The individuals who ultimately en- 
gaged in the prosecution, and those 
also who were brought forward as 
evidences on the trial, had conti- 
nued members of the same small 
community with Mr. Hodge, during 
the whole period that the work of 
deathwasnotoriously proceeding on 
|i!s plantation, and for four years 
after, without ^ne step haying lj»een 



taken towards a judicial investigav 
tion of his conduct. And one of th6' 
persons who look the lead in the prd^:- 
secution had not only lived in habits 
of intimacy with him— until those 
party differences arose, in the 
course of the last year, to which we' 
have already alluded — but had even; 
employed his influence to protect 
him from prosecution*. Then, and 
not before, did this gentleman and 
his party begin to inquire after 
the proof of Mr. Hodge's cruelties 
2|nd murders; and then, and not 
before, were the first depositions 
taken on the subject. It deserves 
also to be noticed, that this unhappy* 
man continued to be the Honout- 
ahle Arthur Hodge, Member of his 
Majesty's Council for the Virgin Is- 
lands, till after his committal, when 
he was suspended from his seat iii 
council by Governor Elliot. * 

It has been already mentioned/ 
that the jury took two hours to con-* 
sider of their verdict; and when it 
was at length returned guilty, it waS) 
accompanied by a recommendation 
of the prisoiier to mercy by a majo^ 
rity of the jurors. To this recom- 
mendation, Governor Elliot, with a 
Uecoming firmness, refused to pay 
any attention. Such, however, was 

* A gentleman, distinguished for hi* 
probity and humanity, who endeavotirejd 
during a temporary residence atTortoIa 
to bring Hodge to justice for some gros$ 
acts of oppression towards a ffeePerson 
of Colour, was frustrated in his humane 
attempt chiefly by the instrumentality 
of this very person. See, to the same 
effect, the letter of Mr. Musgrave in the 
printed papers laid before the Mouse ot 
Commons. '-'"'■^ 

Mr.Hodge was celebrated as a duelllS'^ 
and was said to have killed several metf 
in duels. In the course of the party 
squabble mentioned above, he is reported 
to have challenged his ehief opponent. 
That gentleman naturally enough wish;: 
ed to decline such a perilous meeti9g,<^^ 
It was convenient, therefore, to briBg;

tlte state of irritation produced by 
the novel and unprecedented cir- 
cumstance of a Wliite man condemn- 
ed to death on account of the mur- 
der of bis own slave, and such the 
dread of an attempt on the part of 
the White population for his rescue, 
that Governor Elliot, who had 
judged it prudent to proceed to 
Tortola in person, that he might 
be at hand to watch the course of 
events, felt himself under the ne- 
cessity of proclaiming martial law, 
calling out the colonial militia, and 
^vailing b'oiself of the aid of a fri- 
gate, in order to awe the turbulent 
into submission. In consequfnce 
of these measures, the threatened 
disturbance was prevented, and the 
sentence of the law was regularly 
executed. The Governor observes, 
hi his dispatch; " The state of irri 
tation, and I may almost say of 
anarchy, in which I have found this 
folony (Tortola), rendered the 
above measures indispensable for 
the preservation of tranquillity, and 
for ensuring the due execution of the 
fatal sentence of the Ifiw against the 
late Arthur Hodge. Indeed, it is but 
too probable, that, without my pre- 
sence here as commander-in-chief, in 
a conjuncture so replete with party 
jinimosity, unpleasant occurrences 
might have ensued." 

The reply of Lord Liverpool to 
these communications, is highly 
honourable toljiraand tohisMajes- 
ty's Government. It is dated the 
^Oth June, 1811. 

"I received your several dis- 
patches from No. 34 to No. 41 inclu- 
sive; and however deep the indig- 
nation which your former letters, 
in refertnce to the case of Mr. 
Huggins, have excited, and how- 
ever strong my apprehension that 
Jhe law, as at present administered, 
is inadequate to the j)rcveiition of 
similar excesses, I could still little 
have expected the additional <lelail 
of cruellies that ia therein con- 
veyed. 

" The individual by whom lliey 
M'crp perpetrated, has suflered the 
severest and most ignominious pu- 



nishment the law can inflict: and it 
only now remains for me to express 
an earnest hope, that this rare ex- 
ample of just retribution may effect 
that change in the treatment of the 
unfortunate slaves, which it should 
require no other motives to produce 
than the common feeling of human- 
ity towards a fellow-creature, or 
even the common regard to public 
decency. 

"I am commanded by his Royal 
Highness the Prince Regent, to con- 
vey to you the high satisfaction be 
has derived from your anxious en- 
deavours on this occasion, to secure 
impartial j ustice on the trial, and the 
solemn execution of the sentence; 
and his full approbation of yoqr 
conduct, in not permitting the inter- 
cession of the individuals, whopart- 
]y composed the jury by which Mr. 
Hodije was tried, to suspend the 
termination of that iniquitous ca- 
reer which he had but too long 
been suffered to pursue." 

But it has been said, and pro- 
bably may be said again, that the 
execution of Mr. Hodge, himself a 
planter, for the murder of his slave, 
is a complete refutation of all that 
has been alleged respecting tli^ 
frame of West-Indian society, and 
the inefficacy of West-Indian me- 
liorating laws. But, surely, no one 
who shall have attentively perused 
the above details, will be disposed 
to advance such an argument, or to 
question the justness of the views 
which are contained in the prei- 
ceding Sketches. The vindication 
of those views might be safely left 
to the inferences fairly arising 
from all the circumstances of this 
very transaction. Indeed, instead 
of being weakened, they are greatly 
strengthened by this sickening tale 
of horrors; which, taken in all its 
parts, goes directly to establish the' 
necessity of those silent but effica- 
cious measures of parliamentary 
controul and interference that have 
been recently proposed, but the 



lias 



bare apprehension of whicl 
given so much alarm to the West 



m 



Indian body, ami roused tfaera to 
so vigorous and concurrent a re- 
tsistance. 

This will appear still more 
strongly, by a reference to some 
particulars contained in the pam- 
phlet mentioned at the beginning 
of this Sketch, the authenticity of 
which is placed, as has been shewn 
above, so much beyond dispute, 
that it may almost be considered as 
a public document. 

The islapd of Tortola is only 
about tifteen miles long and seven 
broad. It contains about 800 or 
900 White inhabitants, and about 
7000 Slaves*. The estate of Mr. 
flipdge was very near the chief town 
of Tortola ; so near as to be in full 
view of the barristers and other per- 
sons who were sittiug in the court- 
house, in which his trial was pro- 
ceeding f. His cruelties were not 
practised in some remote and un- 
frequented spot,^ from which their 
distant rupiour might be supposed 
with difficulty to reach the public 
ear, but in the best peopled part 
of the island, In the view and 
within a short ride of the seat of 
the colonial government. It seems 
altogether impossible, therefore, 
that they should have been con- 
cealed from the general knowledge 
of the community in which he 
lived.'' 

it is admitted, that in the year 
l?i03, Mr. Hodge was the owner of 
rieariy 140 Negroes; and that in the 
year 1»11 this number had been 
reduced to 3-3 J. These were facts, 
indeed, which must have been ge- 
neriilly known, because a poll-tax 
was payable in Tortola on slaves ; 
arid the decrease must, therefore, 
have been matter of record. But, 
independently of this circumstance, 

* I'he return of the population, laid 
before Parliament, is not very precise. 
It includes all the British Virgin Islands 
in one total of 1200 Whites and i9000 
Slaves. It is calculated, by persons 
■who have resided in those islands, that 
Tortola alone contains about three- 
fourths of the v^ole. 

t Trial, &c. p. 37. } lb. p. 138, 



the cruelties of Mr. Hodge appear 
to have been quite notorious. This 
is affirmed in the course of the 
trial, without any attempt at con- 
tradiction. How, indeed, could it 
have been otherwise 1 We might as 
well suppose, that in a parish in 
England, containing seven or eight 
thousand inhabitants, it would be 
possible for seventy or eighty mur- 
ders to be committed, in the course 
of three or four years, without at- 
tracting general attention, as that 
the atrocities of Mr. Hodge should 
not have been matter of notoriety 
in Tortola. Indeed, it is admitted 
that they must have been known, 
by report at least, to every indi- 
vidual of this little community. 
The prosecutor, it is said, had only 
subjected to legal inquiry " thai 
which was long known, but re^ 
niained unnoticed and uninvesti* 
gated for want of proof," &c*. 

How happened it, then, that no 
judicial investigation of these trans- 
actions should have taken place — 
that murder after murder should be 
reported tohave been committed by 
Mr. Hodge, and that the Coroner 
should have made no inquisition 
for the blood that had been thus 
wantonly shed 1 One cause of this 
neglect is incidentally explained in 
the course of the trial. 

Oneof the witnesses, of the name 
of Perreen Georges, a free Person of 
Colour, being asked why she had 
not produced her testimony against 
Mr. Hodge at an earlier period, an- 
swered, " 1 dared not — Mr. Hodge 
would kill me t." 

A second witness, Stephen 
M'Keough, a White man, was 
asked, " Have you had any coi^^ 
versations with Mr. J. Skelton^ 
junior, relating to the prisoner 1" 
" I did mention to him," was the 
answer, " Mr. Hodge's treatment 
of his slaves, years ago, when I left 
his employ the first time, and when 
I went to ParaquitaBay: I begged 
him not to mention it again." 
"Why," it was asked " did you en- 
join secrecy V " Because," he re-

plied, *' I knew that if Mr. Hodge 
knew it, he would not hesitate to 
take my life * ." 

Nor did these apprehensions 
cease even after Mr. Hodge had 
been arrested. It is distinctly as- 
serted by Mr. Lisle, and not denied 
by the prisoner's counsel, that 
" the depositions were kept Ijack, 
because, if the prisoner or his 
friends were permitted to know 
who had testified against him, they 
might never ^ he forthcoming t-" 
Nay, it was even deemed necessary 
to place the two principal wit- 
nesses under special protection, as 
" they were afraid of being assas- 
sinated" by the friends of Mr. 
Hodge. 

West-Indian gentlemen have af- 
fected to ridicule the care with 
which Mr. Wilberforce and the 
Directors of the African Institu- 
tion have concealed the names of 
individuals, resident in the West 
Indies, from whom they have de- 
rived important information. But 
does not what transpired in the case 
of Mr. Hodge fully justify their cau- 
tion? If the danger was so immi- 
nent which arose from preferring 
against this single individual, pecu- 
liarly circumstanced as he was, a 
charge that brought, or seemed to 
bring, the relative rights of master 
and slave to a judicial issue, how 
much more formidable would be 
the danger of being detected in 
giving information, which, it would 
be apprehended (whether justly or 
rot), nn'ght affect the character or 
the interests of the whole West In- 
dian community? If the witnesses 
to the cruelties practised by Mr. 
Hodge could scarcely be protected 
from violence, though supported by 
a powerful parly, what hope of 
safety could an individual enter- 
tain, who should be discovered to 
have given evidence, for example, 
of the infractions of the Abolition

the common cause, and could ex- 
pect no mercy. 

The danger which such a person 
would incur will be further illustrat- 
ed by the following fact: — 

'• About thirty years ago, a man 
was bold enough to inform, in one 
of the most important and most po- 
lished of the Leeward Islands, in a 
case of prohibited importation. He 
was immediately seized, tried pub- 
licly by a self constituted court, 
convicted of the foul offence of be- 
ing an informer, and sentenced to 
tarring and feathering, and perpe- 
tual banishment. Accordingly, ia 
contempt of his privileges as a White 
Man, he was stripped to the skin, 
covered with tar and feathers, and 
carried with a drum beating the 
Rogue's March, at mid-day, through 
all the streets of the town; no ma- 
gistrate or peace-offiGer daring or 
choosing to interfere. He was next 
put on board an American ship then 
passing the harbour, and carried oft' 
as a convict to the distant island of 
Jamaica, from whence he could not 
return to his home without going 
first to North America. He had the 
hardihood, nevertheless, in a few 
months to return; called on the go- 
vernment for redress; and the At- 
torney-general was ordered to pro- 
secute the judge of the mock tri- 
bunal, and the immediate execu- 
tioners of the sentence. He did so, 
with much zeal, for the honour of 
the government ; but to no eff'ect. 
Not a witness but the prosecutor 
himself could be found to depose to 
facts which one half of the free po- 
jndation of the island had seen ; and 
the, jury, some of whom could pro- 
bably have confirmed him, as eye- 
witnesses, chose to disbelieve him, 
and found a verdict of not guil- 
ty. The man, who had been kept 
in gaol for his security during the 
prosecution, was glad at tiiw end of 
it to become a voluntary exile for 
life." 

With such examples before their 
eyes, would it not be altogether 
unwarrantable in Mr. Wilberforce 
or ih«,' Directors of the African lii-

stitution, to give up the names 
of their informants, while still re- 
sident in the West Indies, to the 
tender mercies of a West-Indian 
mob? 

But how, then, did it happen that 
Mr. Hodge should at length have 
been brought to trial? This ques- 
tion has already been in some mea- 
sure answered. The dread of Mr. 
Hodge's vengeance, excited by a 
personal quarrel, at length led to 
the steps Avhich issued in this rare 
act of justice. This circumstance 
is clearly alluded to by the Solicitor- 
General acting for the Crown, in his 
closing address to the Jury. Speak- 
ing of the prosecutor as " at one time 
the friend and companion of Mr. 
Hodge," he adds ; " Whether these 
quondam friends have quarrelled 
or not ; or whether the accuser of 
Mr. Hodge discovered the maUg- 
nity of his heart, and the atrocity 
of his acts ; or whether the accu- 
sation proceeded from a motive of 
ill-will or revenge, is not an object 
of minute inquiry on your part, 
provided the fact charged in the 
indictment be proved," &c.* 

In truth, the peril of prosecuting 
Mr. Hodge, for bis cruelties. Was at 
length encountered, to avoid what 
appeared, at least under the govern- 
ment of Mr. Elliot, the still greater 
peril of having to encounter this 
ruffian in single combat; while the 
prosecutor's risk in making the at- 
• enipt was still larther diminished 
by the violent party dissensions 
which at that time prevailed among 
ibe White inhabitants of the island. 

We wish now particularly to call 
the reader's attention to the follow- 
ing extract froni the speech of the 
leading Counsel for the Crown : it 
\vill be found to contirm much of 
^vhat has been already said respect- 
ing the legal condition of the West- 
Indian Slave: — ■ 

" Why the witnesses, whom you 
will soon hear, did not earlier pub- 
lish his guilt, you will learn from 
tfiemselves: why he was not sooner

arrested and brought to trial, you 
may as well, individually, ask your- 
selves as any other person ; for you 
must each, as well as the rest of the 
community, have learned from ru- 
mour the catalogue of his crimes. 
But what is every body's business 
usually is performed by nobody*; 
and not knowing where testimony 
might be procured of his guilt, no 
individual would risk the chance 
of rendering himself the victim of 
Mr. Hodge's resentment and ven- 
geance, by making accusations he 
might not be able to substantiate 
as true : for you well know, gentle- 
men, that oply on the evidence of 
free persons can a free person be 
convicted. Policy has decreed, that 
slaves shall only be permitted to 
testify against their fellow-slaves, 
and not ^.gmn&i free persons in any 
case whatsoever. Were it otherwise, 
I would here introduce a number 
of sable wretches, as witnesses, 
bearing the ostensible external 
marks of the prisoner's cruelty, 
whose very appearance would make 
humanity shudder, and whose tales 
of woe would cause every nerve 
within you to vibrate with mental 
agony ■\." 

The same speaker furnishes an- 
other striking illustration of the 
feelings with which many of the 
West-Indian planters regard the 
slave population. 

* Were there, tlien, no magistrates in 
Tortola? Or was there no coroner to 
institute an inquiry ? Might not Perreen 
Georges and Stephen M'Keough have 
been subjected to examination in 1807, 
as well as in 1811 ? Or could no one in 
that island be found to vindicate thfe 
cause of outraged justice without the 
stimulus of personal danger or party 
animosity ? 

t Not the slightest attempt was made 
by the prisoner's counsel to rebut or to 
weaken this opprobrious statement. It 
was even given in evidence, without the 
slightest contradiction, that the Negroes 
of Mr. Hodge had long been known by 
certain marks which they bore of his in- 
genuity in the art of inflicting torture, 
See Trial, p. 115,

** Notwithstanding," he observes, 
*' the heinousness of the offence, 
the magnitude of the guilt, the 
atrocity of tlie crime, when the 
prisoner was brought up, a few 
days since, under a writ of Habeas 
Corpus, it was not only asserted to 
be an offence bailable at law, but 
it was boldly declared; — blush, hu- 
manity — bJush, justice — to hear it; 
— it was boldly asserted, that a 
Negro, being property, ' it was no 
greater offence in laivfor his owner 
to kill him, than it would be to kill 
his dog*!'" 

He then employs much ingenious 
legal argument to disprove this 
position, and evidently appears to 
have regarded it as by far the most 
formidable difficulty with which he 
had to contend in the conduct of 
his cause f. 



Before concluding tliis Sketch, it 
may be proper to advert to two ob- 
jections which have been advanced 
against the relevancy of such state- 
ments as the preceding. 

1. It is said, that these tales of 
horror are out of date, and that it is 
therefore altogether unwarrantable 
to produce them as evidence of the 
existing state of society in the West 
Indies, live years, however, con- 
stitute no very great lapse of time ; 
only a little more than the period 
during which Justice slumbered 
over the crimes of Mr. Hodge. But, 
to give any force to this objection, 
it ought to be shewn, that the length 
to which iMr. Hodge had run his 
murderous career without provok- 
ing a single inquiry, and the entire 
impunity of Mr. Huggins in a course 
of conduct but little less atrocious, 
had induced the colonial legisla- 
tures to pass laws which should

t Ib.pp. 40— 48. — One of the persons 
summoned on the jury, and who was 
tliaJlenged hj the Crown, said, He 
thought tiiat Hodge's trial " would be 
liurtt'ul to the West-India islands: it

p. 21. 



either prevent the recurrence, or 
ensure the punishment, of similar 
enormities. But this cannot be 
shewn. The laws which regulate 
the relation of master and slave 
continue unaltered. 

2. But, it is further affirmed to 
be in the highest degree unjustifia- 
ble to exhibit these transactions as 
conveying a fair impression of the 
conduct of West-Indians generally 
towards their slaves ; that Huggins 
and Hodge are excepted cases, 
whose example it would be as un- 
just to bring forward, as a specimen 
of colonial humanity, as it would be 
to cite the case of Mrs. Brownrigg, 
as fairly illustrative of the ordinary 
treatment of English apprentices. 

To this we reply, that it never 
was intended to exhibit the cruelties 
of Huggins and Hodge as fair spe- 
cimens of the usual course of West- 
Indian management. On the con- 
trary, these cases of admitted atro- 
city are produced as illustrating, 
not the ordinary conduct of colonial 
masters, but the state of colonial 
legislation, and of the colonial ju- 
dicatories, and the state also of 
feeling which prevails among the 
Whites in the islands with respect 
to their Black fellow-subjects. 

Let us suppose for a moment, 
that such atrocities had been com- 
mitted in this country as these men 
were known to have been guiltyof : — 
how different would have been the 
prevailing sentiment with respect 
to the perpetrators of them ; how 
different the conduct of our ma- 
gistrates, and courts of justice ! 
Here it would have been found 
difficult to restrain the indignation 
of the public from breaking forth 
into acts of premature violence. 
But in the West Indies the IVhite 
mob is uniformly on the side of the 
oppressor. Mr. Huggins rises to 
fresh dignity after his disgraceful 
acquittal, as one who had suffered 
persecution in the sacred cause of 
White supremacy. The witnesses to 
Mr.Hodge's atrocities must be sedu- 
lously guarded from popular fury. 
Found guilty, this monster, though 



40 



loaded with the blood of scores of 
murdered slaves, is recommended as 
a fit object of Royal Clemency! And 
when at length condemned to pay 
tlie forfeit of his crimes on the 
scaffold, the Governor is obliged to 
repair to tlie spot with an armed 
force to prevent a rescue ! 

Admitting, as we readily do, that 
the cases of Hoggins and Hodge 
are cases of peculiar enormity, yet 
whence arose that powerful prepos- 
session in their favour which secur- 
ed to the former an acquittal, in 
the face of the clearest evidence, 
from twelve men sworn to return a 
true verdict ; and which rendered 
the condemnation of the other the 
occasion of such imminent peril to 
the peace of the colony 1 

We do not accuse the resident 
West-Indians generally with acting 



as Huggins and Hodge have done ; 
but we charge them with favouring 
such criminals merely because they 
are Whites and of the cast of masters, 
and with tolerating their crimes be- 
cause committed on those who are 
Black or of the cast of slaves. 

Is it fitting, that to a mere hand- 
ful of men, actuated by such feel- 
ings and prejudices as these, the 
Parliament of Great Britain should 
continue to leave the uncontrouled 
right of legislating for hundreds of 
thousands of their fellow-subjects 1 
— Or will any man believe that a 
community, thus constituted, stands 
in no need of a Registry Bill to pre- 
vent the illicit importation of new 
Negroes, or to protect the rights of 
such of that race as are entitled to 
freedom 1

WEST- INDIAN SKETCHES, &c. 



The present SketcFi is iatended to 
be a mere collection of Anecdotes, 
extracted from the invaluable work 
of Dr. Pinckard. Their object is 
to elucidate the nature of our Co- 
lonial Bondage as it respects, The 
Driving System,The General Treat- 
ment of Slaves, The Effects pro- 
duced by it on the Character of 
the White Women, and The Moral 
and Religious Habits of the Co. 
lonists. 



I. The driving system. 

1. " At one spot, in the course 
of our ride, we had our attention 
arrested by observing a party of 
four, almost naked, females work- 
ing in a cane field. Curiosity 
would not allow us to pass on with- 
out devoting to them a moment of 
particular regard. We, therefure, 
went a little off the road to ap- 
proach them nearer ; when we 
found that they were labouring 
with the hoe, to dig, or cut up the 
ground, preparatory to the plant- 
ing of sugar; and that a stout 
robust-looking man, apparently 
White, was following them, hold- 
ing a whip at their backs. Ob- 
serving that he was the only one 
of the party who was idle, Ave in- 
quired why he did not partake of 
the task, and were told, in reply, 
that it was not his business — that 
he had only to keep the women at 
work, and to make them feel the 
weight of the whip if they grew 
idle or relaxed from their labour," 
Vol. I, p. 140. 

2. "On my way down the coast 
lately from Mahaica, 1 observed 



among the slaves, what to me waisi 
a novelty ; although I was told, by 
a gentleman of the colony, that it 
was by no means uncommon. In 
one of the fields we passed a gang 
of Negroes employed at their labour, 
with a female driver carrying the 
Avhip at their backs. On my re- 
marking that it was not a becoming 
duty for the beau scxe — that the 
nature of the lady might be too 
tender to admit of her correcting 
the strong, and her arm too feeble 
to enable her to chastise the idle— 
my companion replied, that I was 
much mistaken ; for, on the con- 
trary, the 'women drivers' were 
sometimes peculiarly severe, aind 
often corrected the stoutest slaves 
with no feeble arm." Vol. II. p. 121, 

3. " In the course of our walk', 
I had the opportunity of observing 
a species of Negro-labour that was 
new to me ; having met a party of 
sixteen naked slaves, male and 
female, in the act of dragging the 
trunk of an immense tree out of 
the forest, with ropes. They were 
conducted by a driver with his 
whip ; and pulled on the load by 
mere strength of arm, having no 
assistance from any machinery, and 
only availing themselves of the 
simple expedient of placing small 
billets of wood under the tree, at 
short distances from each other, 
in order to prevent it from sinking 
into the dirt, and doubling their 
toil." Vol. II. p. 109. 

4. " In walking through Kingston 
(Jamaica), I observed an example of 
slavery unlike any that had met 
my eye to windward — sixteen or 
eighteen Negroes linked in a sort 

G2 



44 



of harness, and forming a regular 
team, were drawing an immense 
trank of mahogany, conducted by 
adriver with a cart-whip, who went 
whistling at their side, and flogging 
them on, precisely as an English 
carter does his horses." Vol. II. 
p. 371. 

5. At p. 129, Vol. II. Dr. Pinck- 
ard speaks of some soldiers, who, 
having been confined for irregular 
conduct, were indignant at seeing 
Black Rangers placed over them as 
centinels, who " since their arrival 
in the colony had toiled all day in 
the field goaded as horses or oxen" 
In the course of his reasoning on 
the subject, he adds, in a strain 
very different from what we have 
been accustomed to hear from the 
mouths of some West Indians — 
" Compared to slavery the restric- 
tions of military discipline are as 
exquisite freedom ; and the Negro 
who has once tasted it cannot be 
expected to return quietly to the 
^'oke, and again expose his back to 
the whip." Vol. II. p. 130. 



II. General treatment of 

SLAVES. 

1. " In our perambulations, we 
often witness gross and disgusting 
scenes among the slaves. Lately 
we saw a naked washing party, 
whose skins exhibited very inde- 
cently the crowded scars of repeat- 
ed punishment," Vol. I. p. 123. 

2. " Very much to the discredit 
of Barbadoes, numbers of old, dis- 
eased, or decrepit Negroes, objects 
of compassion and of horror, are 
seen lying at the corners, or beg- 
ging about the streets. This, like 
the toleration of the swarms of 
mendicants in England, is a nui- 
sance for which there is no excuse. 
If these poor unfortunate Negroes 
be free, they should be relieved by 
a general tax upon the island : if 
slaves, the law should compel every 
master to provide for his own. 



Should the laws of humanity be 
insufficient, and those of justice 
inadequate, a law of coercion should 
constrain the unfeeling owner to 
protect and cherish the being, 
whose youth and vigour have been 
expended for his benefit ; and who, 
having worn out his days in the 
heavy toils of bondage, is grown 
aged and infirm !" Vol. I. p. 295. 

3. " It has happened to me to be 
addressed by a wretched slave, 
strongly entreating me to purchase 
her from her master." *' She was a 
very decent young woman, here 
termed ' a house-wench.' The 
hardships and ill treatment she had 
suffered, had created, she said, such 
an entire dislike to her present 
home, that if she could find no 
' good massa' who would buy her, 
she had determined to try to escape 
from her misery by running away. 
The poor creature shuddered as 
she mentioned this expedient, sen- 
sible that if she should be retaken, 
her sufferings, great as they were, 
would be sadly multiplied. Still 
she declared she was firmly re- 
solved to hazard the attempt, rather 
than continue her, now, wretched 
life, hopeless of relief. 

" The heavy tear swelled on her 
dark cheek as she related the seve- 
rities to which she had been sub- 
jected. Her tale was at once inte- 
resting and distressful. It needed 
not the aid of eloquence to move 
compassion. The simple narration 
of the cruelties imposed, and the 
punishments inflicted for only tri- 
vial faults, instantly roused the 
feelings, and in strong appeal begat 
a new regret that hosts of human 
creatures, for the mere lucre of a, 
few of their fellow-beings, differiag; 
in the colour of their skin, should 
be degraded to a situation, which 
not only deprives them of the com- 
mand oftheir persons, but, also, robs 
them of all the powers of will. 

" Divested of every right, a slave 
has no redress, not even against the 
bitterest wrongs: however oppress- 
ed, however injured, he has no re= 



45 



source — uo means of relief! Not 
having the power of changing his 
home, he has no escape from ill 
usage or cruelty ; but is condemned 
to travel the long journey of hfe ia 
hopeless discontent." Vol. I. p. 342. 

4. " In my walk to the Negro-yard 
I met a slave, who appeared under 
a peculiar mode of punishment, 
being compelled to wear an iron 
collar with three long spikes pro- 
jectingfromit, in sharpened points, 
to the distance of eight or ten inches 
from his person. What crime had 
led to this strange method of pu- 
nishment I did not learn. The poor 
man not only suffered the annoyance 
of moving about, loaded with this 
heavy collar, but he was effectually 
prevented from lying down, and 
from approaching near to any per- 
son without the danger of injuring 
him with the sharp points of his 
iron yoke." Vol. I. p. 470. 

5. "Two unhappy Negroes, a man 
and a woman, having been driven 
by cruel treatment to abscond 
from the plantation Lancaster, were 
taken a few days since, and brought 
back to the estate, when the mana- 
ger, whose inhuman severity had 
caused them to fly from his govern- 
ment, dealt out to them his aveng- 
ing despotism with more tlian sa- 
vage brutality. Taking with him 
two of his strongest drivers, armed 
with heavy whips, he led out these 
trembling and wretched Africans, 
early in the morning, to a remote 
part of the estate, too distant for 
the officers to hear their cries; and 
there, tying down first the man, he 
stood by, and made the drivers flog 
him with many hundred lashes, 
until, on releasing him from the 
ground, it was discovered that he 
was nearly exhausted : ia this state 
the monster struck him on llie 
liead, with the but end of a large 
whip, and felled him again to the 
earth ; when the poor Negro, escap- 
ing at once from his slavery and 
Lis sufferings, expired at the mur- 
derer's feet, liut not satiated with 



blood, tins savage tyrant next tied 
down the naked woman, oa the 
spot, by the dead body of her 
husband, and with the whips, 
already purple with gore, com- 
pelled the drivers to inflict a pu- 
nishment of several hundred lashes, 
which had nearly released her also 
from a life of toil and torture. 

" Hearing of these acts of cruelty, 
on my return from the hospital, 
and scarcely believing it possible 
that they could have been com- 
mitted, I went immediately to the 
sick^iouse to satisfy myself by 
ocular testimony: when, alas! I 
discovered that all I had heard 
was too fatally true ; for, shocking 
to relate, I found the almost mur- 
dered woman lying stark-naked oa 
her belly, upon the dirty boards, 
without any covering to the horrid 
wounds which had been cut by the 
whips, and with the still warm and 
bloody corpse of the man extended 
at her side, upon the neck of which 
was an iron collar, and a long heavy 
chain, which the now- murdered 
Negro had been made to wear from 
the time of his return to the estate. 
The flesh of the woman was so 
torn, as to exhibit one extensive 
sore, from the loins almost down to 
her hams ; nor had humanity ad- 
ministered even a drop of oil to 
soften her wounds : the only re- 
lief she knew, was that of extend- 
ing her feeble arm in order to beat 
off the tormenting flies, with a 
small green bough, which had 
been put into her hand for that 
purpose by the sympathising kind- 
ness of a fellow- slave. A more 
horrid and distressful spectacle can 
scarcely be conceived. The dead 
man, and the almost expiring woman 
had been brought home, iVom the 
place of punishment, and thrown 
into the Negro hospital, amidst tlie 
crowd of sick, with cruel uncon- 
cern. Lying on the opposite side 
of the corpse was a fellow-suft'erer, 
in a similar condition to the poor 
woman, ilis buttocks, thighs, and 
j)art of his back, had been flog- 
ged into one large sore, which was 



46 



still raw, although he had been 
punished a fortnight before. 

*' The following day we witnessed 
the preparations for the funeral of 
their nnirdered brother, by his 
fellow-slaves. It was conducted 
in their usual manner, not with the 
afflicting solemnity of the Christian 
rites, but with all the mirthful 
ceremonies of African burial, forra- 
ino- a scene of gaiety, which con- 
sisled of music, dancing, singing, 
and loud noise. They all seemed to 
rejoice more in his escape from 
pain and misery, than to sorrow for 
his loss.'' 

" A few day after the funeral, 
the attorney of the estate happened 
to call at Lancaster to visit ihe 
officers : and the conversation na- 
turally turning upon the late cruelty 
of the manager, and the consequent 
injury derived to the proprietor, 
we asked him what punishment 
the laws of the colony had pro- 
vided for such horrid and barba- 
rous crimes ; expressing our hope 
that the manager would suifer the 
disgrace ho so justly merited; when, 
to our great surprise, the attorney 
smiled, and treated our remarks 
only as the dreams of men un- 
practised hi the ways of slavery. 
He spake of the murder with as 
little feeling as the manager had 
perpetrated it, and seemed to be 
amused at our visionary ideas, of 
punishing a white man for his 
conduct towards slaves! To the 
question, whether the manager 
would not be dismissed from the 
estate, he replied, ' Certainly not;' 
adding, that ' if the Negro had 
been treated as he deserved he would 
have been flogged to death long 
before.' Such was the amount of 
his sympathy and concern! The 
laws of the colony, he said, were 
intended to prevent any person 
from chastising a slave with more 
than thirty-nine lashes, for the 
same oifence; but by incurring 
only a small tine, he could, at any 
time, punish a Negro with as many 
hundred lashes as he might wish, 
* although the governor and the 



fiscal ' were standing at his el- 
bow, 

" I was careful to observe the 
progress of the hideous wounds 
inflicted upon the poor woman, 
and to watch her recovery; and 
you will be shocked to know that 
her sufferings Were severely in- 
creased by the inhuman neglect 
Avliich succeeded to her punish- 
ment. One morning, upon hearing 
the loud cries of a female, I was 
led to look out at my window, 
when I saw some Negroes carrying 
this unfortunate woman from the 
sick-house into the yard, where' 
they laid her down in the dirt, 
upon the bare ground, amidst a 
heavy shower of rain; then, kneel- 
ing at her sides, tliey proceeded 
to examine minutely into her 
wounds : and you will scarcely 
hold it credible, when I tell you 
that they were employed a full 
half-hour picking maggots out of 
her sores ! ! ! The ulcerations had 
penetrated to a great depth, par- 
ticularly withinside the thighs, 
where the lashes of the whips had 
cut round, and torn the flesh in a 
frightful manner. The ulcers were 
very raw and considerably en- 
larged, by the gnawing of the mag- 
gots which had been bred within 
them. I cannot describe to you 
the horror I felt at this deplorable 
sight. I had often heard of mag- 
goting sheep, but this was the first 
instance I had met with of mag- 
goting a human being ; and I felt 
additional "distress in finding the 
subject of it an unhappy female, 
whose punishment had been already 
severe; and in whom the occasion 
for such a beastly process might 
and ought'to have been prevented, 
if the common dictates of humanity 
had been observed. The poor 
afflicted wretch groaned heavily 
under her sufferings, and the ope- 
ration, which in itself was severely 
painful, was rendered so in a still 
greater degree by the roughness of 
iier untutored surgeons. During 
the whole of the time, she was ex- 
posed naked to the rain ; also to- 



47 



the eyes of slaves, officers, soldiers, 
and all who chanced to pass that 
way. It was a spectacle, equally 
offiensive to humanity and to de- 
licacy ! 

" On representing the diabolical 
cruelty of this case to the surgeon, 
he remarked to us, that the sores, 
from punishments, did not usually 
fall under his inspection, but were 
left to the care of the Ne2;ro-doctor 
who had the charge of the sick- 
house ; and that nothing was more 
common than to see the wounds 
tilled witii maggots : * indeed,' said 
he, * it is often our greatest diffi- 
culty, in the practice of surgery in 
these climates, to prevent the breed- 
ing of insects in the sores.' 

" I am sorry to remark, that the 
Lancaster plantation has been dis- 
tinguished for some time past, on 
account of the inhuman treatment 
of the slaves : in fact, it seemed as 
if cruelty had become contagious 
upon this estate ; for we learn, from 
the most respectable authority, 
that a former proprietor was so 
hardened in his savage conduct 
that, frequently, when an unfortu- 
nate Negro was bound down to the 
earth, and groaning under the 
severe pain of two heavy lashes, 
he would strike him a blow upon 
the head with the but end of his 
whip, between each of the strokes 
given by the drivers; and that, 
carrying his barbarity still further, 
he would sometimes order the teeth 
of the slave to be torn out with a 
pair of iron pincers, and would 
himself stand by to see the torture 
inflicted. 

" I can anticipate your senti- 
ments upon reading the history of 
these shocking punishments, for 
they afford lamentable examples of 
the horrors and injustice of slavery; 
and you cannot but think, with me, 
that the system which gives to an 
individual the power of lording his 
worst passions, over a fellow- being, 
uncontrolled, admits of no defence. 
It is a violation of nature, in which 
Jiwmanity is outraged, and our 



species degraded!" Vol. II. pp. 
45—54. 

6. " On the morning of January 
13th, a well-looking robust Negro 
unexpectedly presented himself at 
my door, tendering his services, 
and begging that he might be al- 
lowed to work for me. Upon my 
going out to speak with him, his 
countenance gladdened with joy, 
and looking animated and cheerful, 
he said he would * do ebery ting 
to 'blige massa, ivait upoji massa, 
clean massa' s horse, and do all de 
work massa tell him.' 

" Not immediately recollecting 
his features, I asked who he was, 
whence he came, and how it hap- 
pened that he addressed himself to 
me? when he replied, ' Ak massa^ 
if you no remember Prince, Prince 
no forget dat massa tell 'em sol- 
diersfor break one great iron collar 
off Prince's neck, and gave him for 
gnyaam ivhen massa at Mahaica!' 
This brought him to my recollec- 
tion ; and I recognised an unhappy 
slave, whom, in one of ray walks 
at Mahaica, I had met wandering 
in a cotton-field, bearing a heavy 
iron collar upon his neck, with 
three long spikes projecting from 
it, terminating in sharp points, at 
the distance of nearly a foot and a 
half from his person; and with his 
body flogged into deep ulcers, from 
his loins to his hams. In this state, 
and almost starving with hunger, 
he appealed to my feelings. Bu- 
manity pleaded in his behalf, and, 
without a very scrupulous inquiry 
into the whys and wherefores of 
the punishment, its dictates were 
obeyed. The poor man followed 
me to the fort: the soldiers grew 
indignant on seeing his naked sores ; 
and the impulse of their feelings 
not being opposed, his neck was 
quickly free(l from its load, and the 
massive yoke and its spikes were as 
speeilily convert(d into pot hooks 
for the benefit of the niess. Thus 
made haj)py, the thankfid slave 
had now found his way to my home 



-43 



at La Bourgade, iu order to make 
his further acknowledgments, and 
to tender me his services. Shall 
it be said that Africans know not 
the divine sentiment of gratitude?" 
Vol.11, p. 174. 

7. " I took my farewel dinner with 
a party at the commandant's ; and, 
in the evening, after I had retired, 
but while the other gentlemen re- 
mained at table, they were dis- 
turbed by the groans of some per- 
son, who seemed to be iu extreme 
agony. Prompted by feelings of 
humanity, Colonel Hislop sent one 
of the officers to the house, from 
whence the afflicting cries were 
thought to proceed, in order to 
ascertain if any person were ill, 
or if it might be in his power to 
afford relief; when, to the astonish- 
ment of all who were present, a 
scene of the most shocking cruelty 
was discovered. Instead of meet- 
ing with any one in sickness, the 
gentleman deputed upon this com- 
mission found a wretched slave 
suffering under a species of torture 
which could only have been in- 
vented by the most diabolical ma- 
lignity. 

" The unfortunate man was tied 
down to the ground, with his 
limbs stretched out to the utmost 
extent; the legs being fastened 
with heavy chains, and the hands 
with strong cords, M'hich were 
painfully tightened by being twist- 
ed with pieces of wood, placed 
across the wrists. For the honour 
of human nature, I hope it is a 
solitary, although an absolute, fact, 
that tliis poor Negro had been so 
confined, without being allowed 
a morsel of food, for three days; 
and with the additional cruelty 
of being burnt across the fleshy 
parts of his person at repeated in- 
tervals, with red-hot iron. Could 
such a mode of torture have sug- 
gested itself to any other mind than 
that of a blacksmith 1 which was 
the occupation followed by the de- 
praved monster, into whose fiery 



hands it was the lot of this unfor- 
tunate African to have fallen ! 

"The dreadful tale being report- 
ed to the commandant, a file of the 
guard was instantly marched to the 
house, with orders to release the 
sufferer; and quickly,with the irons 
and cords remaining on his limbs, 
he was led before the colonel and 
party, whose timely humanity had 
saved his life. His fetters were 
now removed ; food and wine were 
offered to him ; and he was soothed 
with the assurance that justice 
should be done to his cause: but 
his strength was so exhausted as 
scarcely to admit of restoration! 
Upon swallowing a morsel of bread, 
moistened with wine and water, 
the effect upon his famished sto- 
mach was so painful as to produce 
extreme distress, and he nearly 
fainted : but, after a little time, he 
was so much recovered by the kind 
attentions of the commandant and 
his friends, as to be sensible of the 
anxieties of those about him; and, 
when questioned regarding the 
crime which had provoked this 
horrid punishment, it proved that 
he was utterly ignorant for what 
fault, or upon what pretence, he 
had been treated with such savage 
barbarity ! 

" The hardened wretch, his mas- 
ter, was examined as to the nature 
of the offence which had urged 
him to this frightful example of 
cruelty. Whether his conscious- 
ness of the insignificance of the 
alleged misdemeanor, or the 
dread of the requital he merited, 
prevented him from avowing it, 
I could not learn, but he persisted 
in the most obstinate silence re- 
specting it, and replied only by 
confused and hurried appeals, pi-r 
teously imploring the commandant 
to pardon him, and beseeching 
that he might not be subjected to 
the ignominy of a personal punish- 
ment. His agitation was excessive: 
forgetful how grievously he had 
debased himself by his outrageous 
conduct, the apprehension of being 



4^ 



exposed to the degradation of a 
corporal chastisement so entirely 
possessed his mind, that no direct 
answer could be obtained from him; 
every reply being an humble pe- 
tition for mercy, or an anxious sup- 
plication not to be stigmatized with 
thedisgraceful retribution, which he 
seemed conscious that he deserved." 
Vol. II. p. 332. 



A'miglity—God bless you, massa ! 
I beg you pardon ! Oh ! massay 
Oh ! J beg you pardon ! Oh ! God 
A'mighty — God bless you!' — Still 
the whip sounded aloud, and slill 
the lady cried, ' Ay, it is very ne- 



cessary 



" Such is the effect of habit in 
subduing even our most amiable 
emotions. Could this lady have 
known how much her remarks de- 
formed her, policy would have led, 
no doubt, to a different expression, 
although humanity had not taught, 
nor custom allowed her to possess

of exciting the repugnant sensa- 
tions felt by Europeans on first 
witnessing it, scarcely does it pro- 
duce, in the breasts of those accus- 
tomed to the West Indies, even the 
slightest glow of compassion. The 
lady I have above alluded to ap- 
pears of good natural disposition, 
and in no degree disposed to gene- 
ral cruelty ; but the frequency of 
the sight has rendered her callous 
to its usual inHuence upon the feel- 
ings. Beinjr one morning at her 
house, while sitting in conversation, 
we suddenly h^ard the loud cries 
of a Negro smarting nnder the 
whip. Mrs. expressed sur- 
prise on observing me shudder at 
his shrieks; and you will believe 
that I was in utter astonishment to 
find her treat his sufferings as mat- 
ter of amusement. It proved that 
the punishment proceeded from 
the arm of the lady's husband, and 
fell upon one of her o\^n slaves! 
Can you believe that, on learning 
this, she exclaimed with a broad 
smile, * Aha! it will do him 
good ! A little wholesome flagel- 
lation will refresh him : it will so- 
ber him : it will open his skin, and 
make him alert. If Y — was to 
give it them all, it would bo of ser- 
vice to them !' 

" I could not compliment the 
lady upon her hnniiinity. The loud 
clang of the whip continued ; and 
the poor inii)Ioring Negro as loudly 
cried, ' Oh massa, maasa, — God 



2. " Unfortunately I am now 
enabled to speak of the punishment 
of a slave, which was far more 
severe than that mentioned in my 
last letter; and, I am sorry to add, 
attended with similar marks of in- 
sensibility, and want of feeling, on 
the part of a White female. Hap- 
pening to call one morning upon a 
lady at Stabroek, in company with 
several Europeans who had been 
my fellow-passengers hither, we 
were scarcely seated before we 
heard the clang of the whip, and 
the painful cries of an unfortunate 
Black. The lady of the house, 
more accustomed to scenes of 
slavery than ourselves, pointing to 
the spot, as if it were a pleasant 
sight for strangers, or something 
that might divert us, asked, with 
apparent glee, if we saw them 
'flogging the Negre !' Truly we 
saw the whole too clearly. A 
poor unhappy slave was stretch- 
ed out naked, upon the open 
street, tied down, with his face to 
the ground, before the fiscal's 
door; his two legs extended to one 
stake, his arms strained out, at full 
length, to two others in form of 
the letter Y ; and, thus secured to 
the earth, two strong-armed dri- 
vers% placed at his sides, were 

" * Slaves so termed from beinf? pro- 
moted to the distinguislicd office of i'oir 
lowing their comrades, upon all occa- 
sions, with a whip at their backs, as au 
English carter nttends his horses."

cutting his bare skin, by turns, 
with long heavy-lashed whips, 
which, from the sound, alone, 
without seeing the blood that fol- 
lowed, conveyed the idea of tear- 
ing away pieces of tiesh at every 
stroke." Vol. I. pp. 347— 34a. 

3. " A few days ago I was ap- 
plied to by the wife of a colonist, 
to request that I would make some 
complaint to her husband against 
the slaves of the house, very hu- 
manely urging as a reason for im- 
posing upon me so grateful a task, 
that she wished ' to get them a good 

Jlogging!' I trust that neither 
you, nor any of our fair friends, on 
the European shore of the Atlantic, 
■will condemn my want of gallantry 
in resisting the solicitation. It was 
not even contended, that any specific 
fault h;id been committed to justify 
the punishment ; but this was to 
he invented, and merely because 
some idle whim, some fit of ca- 
price, or ill humour had led the 
Kiistress of these poor slaves to 
wish them 'a good Jlogging !' " 
Vol. I. p. 369. 

4. " I should stand accused of 
neglecting our contract, were I to 
omit telling you that, in a late 
provision-hunting excursion, our 
party met two Dutch ladies upon 
the road, travelling, with great 
state, in a chaise drawn by six 
naked slaves, instead of horses. 
This was a scene of novelty, it be- 
ing one of the toils of slavery 
which we had not before chanced 
to witness ; nor indeed had we 
heard that it was practised." Vol. 
II. p. 283. 



IV. Moral and religious 

HABITS. 

1. " A word," says our author, 
" upon the total neglect of sacred 
ordinances which prevails in these 
colonies. Knowing that the esta- 
blished religion of the Dutch is 
Calvinism, you will be much sur- 



prised io learn ^hat all the ceremo- 
nies of the Sabbath are utterly dis- 
regarded. No church or temple is 
to be found in the settlements; nor 
have the inhabitants even appro- 
priated any house, or other build- 
ing, for the performance of Divine 
service. Neglecting their own 
duties to the Deity, they have used 
no means to inculcate a sense of 
religious awe, or of moral convic- 
tion, among the slaves, but have 
confided the government of these 
degraded beings solely to terror 
and the whip. Sunday, it is true, 
has been set apart as a day of rest, 
but no solemn ceremony mark 
it as the Sabbath. Idleness and 
merriment alone distinguish it from 
the other days of the week. It is 
a holiday to the Negroes, but no 
part of it is devoted to their moral 
or religious improvement: not one 
hour is appropriated to instruct 
them in the duties we all owe to 
the Creator; or to teach them the 
principles which ought to govern 
the conduct of man towards man.'' 
Vol. II. p. 131. 

2. Some idea may be formed of the 
very degraded state of moral feel- 
ing even among the White inhabi- 
tants of the West Indies, from the 
following fact which Dr. Piuckard 
records with becoming disgust and 
astonishment: — 

" It is usual, in these colonies, 
for a person to take a Negro, or 
more frequently a Mulatto, or 
mestce woman as housekeeper and 
companion ; and, if he have chil- 
dren by her, and cannot afford, or 
does not choose, to be at the ex- 
pense of sending them to Europe 
to be educated, he derives no dis- 
honour from breeding up the sons 
as mechanics, and giving out the 
daughters, in keeping, to his 
friends ; and so commonly is this 
practice established, that no feel- 
ings of remorse seem to attach to 
it : on the contrary, it is deemed 
the best provision the parent can 
make for his daughter." Vol. II. 
p. 13G. 



51 



Aud yet a West-Indian planter 
and merchant of eminence, and a 
member of the British Parliament, 
has not scrupled to tell us, in a 
recent publication, that tiie laws 
which have been framed in the West 
Indies to obstruct the manumission 
of slaves, were adopted " to dis- 
courage" "illicit and vicious con- 
nections between White men and 
Negro or Coloured women!" He 
must have placed a large reliance 
on the credulity of the British 
public, and on their ignorance of 
West-Indian society, before he 
could have ventured on so gross 
a misrepresentation. 



The whole terra of Dr. Pinck- 
ard's residence in the slave co- 
lonies subject to Great Britain was 
only eighteen months. We cannot 



conclude ibis Sketch without ask- 
ing our readers, whether they think 
it possible that a traveller should 
have resided in any other civilized 
portion of the globe, and especially 
a country subjected to British rule, 
for so short a time, and yet have 
been the eye-witness of such a 
multiplicity and complication of 
horrors, as were crowded into the 
period of Dr. Pinckard's West- 
Indian tour*? And is nothing to 
be done by the British Parliament, 
and the British People, to remedy 
this monstrous state of injustice 
and oppression? 

* See, besides the present Sketch, 
Sketches I. and III. for farther extracts 
to the same effect, from this intelligent 
writer. But it is necessary to peruse 
the work itself, to have an adequate 
idea of all the horrors of West-Indian 
slavery.

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c; 



Some gentleman having lately 
thought it necessary to publish 
what he calls an Antidote to the 
West-Indian Sketches, it may not 
be amiss to make a few observa- 
tions on the accuracy and candour 
exhibited in the productions of this 
advocate for liberality and truth. 
His accusations agaiust us may he 
reduced principally to three: — That 
we are perpetually charging on all 
the colonists, to the unjust and 
indiscriminate defamation of their 
characters, all the atrocious crimes 
which have at any time been coni- 
laitted by the most inhuman indi- 
viduals, whom they detest equally 
with ourselves ; and, among the 
rest, all the tyranny and oppression 
committed by the Dutch in Guiana, 
-although the harshness of their treat- 
ment, and the comparative huma- 
nity of the English, are matters of 
perfect notoriety ; — that we have 
imputed to the present generation 
the misdeeds of their predecessors 
twenty or thirty years ago, passing 
over the intermediate amelioration 
which has taken place; — and that, 
still with the same unfairness of 
intention, we have, by suppressing 
all the favourable circumstances 
in Dr. Pinckard's narration, com- 
pletely reversed the impression of 
the state of British Colonial Sla- 
very which his history is calcu- 
lated (whether intended or not) to 
convey. 

On recurring to the former Num- 
bers of the Sketches, tlie refutation 
of these charges appears to be an- 
ticipated in so great a degree as 
to prove, that, if this writer has 
himself read them with any care 
(which seems scarcely possible), liis 
remarks are intended for such of 
his friends as have not. With a 



vi«w to him, therefore, more i« 
scarcely necessary than to refer to 
the Numbers already published. 
With a view to others, we add a 
few words of explanation. 

Our antagonist begins — "A small 
pamphlet, entitled West-Indian 
Sketches, has lately been dissemi- 
nated, &c. in order to prejudice 
the public, &c. against the whole 
society of the West Indies. This is 
only part of a system that has been 
long pursued by a few individuals 
in this country, who, in defiance of 
truth, in contradiction to authen- 
tic information, and with unparal- 
leled effrontery, have dared to ac- 
cuse the colonists of every crime 
their heated imaginations could 
conjure up." 

It cannot be denied that the 
authors of the Sketches are here 
accused of charging indiscrimi- 
nately and falsely, on all the colo- 
nists, all manner of crimes ; such 
crimes having existence only in 
their own heated imaginations. 
Now to the truth; and, in the first 
place, as to the want of discrimi- 
nation — 

In Sketch No. I. p. G, a doubt 
is expressed " whether the temper 
and feelings of the White popula- 
tion of the West Indies towards 
the slaves have undergone any 
marked change." But this doubt, 
it is added, " refers not to en- 
lightened proprietors residing in 
this country, nor to various cases 
of men ot enlarged minds and 
liberal education residing in the 
Colonies, but to the body of resi- 
dent Whites." 

In Sketch IV. p. 39, it is further 
remarked : — " It was never intend- 
ed to exhibit the cruellies of Hug- 
gins and Hodge as fair specimens q/ 

12 



BG 

Ihc usual C0UV6C of West-Indian ma- 
iiaf^ement. On the contrary," &c. 

Now M'liat subterfuge u left] In 
the first of these passages, even the 
doubt as to ihe tenqjer of the Whites 
being cliiinged, is not proposed 
wilhoHt discrimination. In the 
second, while ihe cases of Bugging 
aaid Hodge establish,, beyond con- 
tradiction, that within these six of 
Sjiven years (not twenty), the most 
tnormoiis eruelJies (beyond any 
M'hich oisr ijiuiginaJJons, when most 
beated, wouid have suggested,) not 
only might be, but actually were, 
committed in two separate islands ; 
m one of which the Governor 
ihoughf himself obliged to adopt 
vigorous measures to prevent a 
fescue oi the offender; while, in the 

other But let the case speak 

for ilself: it speaks a thousand 
Tolumts to those who can feeL 
i\j5d here the most express denial is 
sgain given to the intention of re- 
presenting these as fair specimens 
of the ordinary course of West-In- 
dian management — unnecessarily 
indeed, because it is only a repe- 
.lition, for the hundredth time, of 
disavowals of the St^me nature, 
which have always beeo made in 
the speeches and writings of the 
AboiilionJsts, 

What then are our allegations, 
^'V'liicb we repeat and snaintain ] 
Thst the state of slavery in the West 
ladies is -attended wish such de- 
gradalioii of the Negro, as naiuraily 
to produce a treatment of them simi- 
lar to that of brutes," — that their 
legal incapacity of giving evidence 
affords a facility to a master of 
escaping conviction for ahiiost any 
act of vvliich he s^ay be guilty 
toi^'Srds his slaves ;—iha1, in con- 
sequence, they have no security 
against such a degree of abuse as 
may be quite suHicient to render 
them miserable ; — tSsat, in fact, 
such abuses do occur, and that 
it is no breach of chaiisy or of pro- 
bability to suppose thens frequent. 
And whatever condemnation of 
the system, or of tise cooducl of 
many isidividoais^ al! this mity 



iinply, we ssy that it is pure ilollj 
to deny it ; that it stands upon the 
face of the thing, and cannot be 
otherwise ; that the evidence of it, 
which is adduced in tiiese very- 
Sketches, is incontrovertible; and 
that the defiance of truth, of au- 
thentic information, anrl, therefore, 
the effrontery, is al! on the side of 
those who risk the denial. See 
to these points the communications 
of Lord Seaforth, of which more 
hereafter; ofSirWiUi-am Young; of 
Governor Prevost, and others ; as 
well as the cases of Haggins 
and Hodge, &c. v.'hieh we vvii! not 
repeat, but desire our readers to 
refer to them again and again when- 
ever these miserable attempts are 
made to impose on their under- 
standings. Of Dr. Pinckard we 
must borrow again, to shew that 
we have not, either by misquoting 
or omitting, altered his words, per- 
verted his meaning, or mistated 
his sentiments. To this purpose it 
will not be necessary for us, to 
enter into any defence of those ex- 
tracts which relate only to the 
planters of Berbice and Dernarara. 
They, it seems, are only Dutchmefij, 
whom our antagonist is ready, and 
even eager, to sacrifice at the shrine 
of humanity. But, deferring for the 
present some observatiuns we shall 
have to make on this subject, our 
additional quotations will be chieiiy 
confined to those general censures 
on the state of slavery, and the- 
society in which it is found, wliich 
Dr. Pinckard bestows upon it alike 
in Guiana and in Baibadoes; 
while he remarks also, in both, the 
happy efft'cts of individual hu- 
manity, ihe inefficacy of legal pro- 
tection, the prevalence of a most 
liberal hospitality, and the de- 
struction of female delicacy. 

To proceed then — We first en- , 
treat our readers to refer to the 
last Sketch, No. V,, and, under 
Head ii. " General Treatment," 
to read the story of the " House 
Wench ;" particularly atteriding 
to the following reflections, ^>vith 
wliich it cosicludes; "Divested of 



57 



every right, a slave has no redress, 
not even against the bitterest 
virrongs : — however oppressed.jhow- 
ever injured, he lias no resource, no 
means of reJiefl Not Iravia-; the 
power of changing his home, be has 
no escape from ill usage or cruelty, 
but is condemned to travel the long 
journey of life in hopeless discon- 
tent! " 

Again, in Vol. I. p. 360, Dr. 
Pinciiard, after describing a Negro 
sale, thus proceeds : — " Silent tears, 
deep si^lis, and heavy lamenta- 
tions proved the bitter suffering 
of these poor Blacks, and told that 
nature "as ever true to her feel- 
ings. Never was a scene more 
distressful. Among these unhap- 
py, degraded Africans, scarcely an 
unclouded countenance could be 
seen. Every feature was veiled in 
the gloom of woe ; and their grief 
was poured forth in all the sad- 
ness of affliction. 

*' A host of jjainful ideas rushed 
into my mind at the moment; and 
all the distorted images of this ab- 
horrent traific presented them- 
selves to my recollection. The 
many horrors and cruelties which 
I had so often heard of, appeared 
in their v\orst shapes before me; 
and my imagination was acutely 
alive to the unmerited punishment 
sometimes inflicted, the incessant 
labour exacted, the want of free- 
dom, and all the catalogue of hard- 
ships endured by slaves. I en- 
deavoured to combat the effect of 
these impressions by directing my 
mind to the opposite images. Tlie 
Kind treatment of Negroes under 
humane masters occurred to me: 
I recollected the comfort and har- 
mony of the slaves I had lately seen 
at ' Trofil.' 1 contemplated their 
exemplioi! from care, and the many 
anxieties of the world ; and I re- 
membered the happiness and con- 
tentment expressed in their songs 
and merry dances: but all in vain! 
The repugnant influence would 
not thus be cheated. With sucli 
distress before my eyes, all pallia- 



tives were unavailing. The whol^ 
was wrong, and not to be justified. 
I felt that ! execrated every prin- 
ciple of the traffic. Nature re- 
volted at it^ and I condemned the 
whole system of slavery, under all 
its forms and modifications," Vol. 
I. p. 360. 

These two last passages relate 
to Berbice ; and, it is said, give 
only Dutch manners — notoriously

what does this story prove? Be-

the following extracts. They re- 
spect Barbadoes, the oldest of our 
Slave Colonies. 

" On rirst making inquiries," says 
Dr. Pinckard, " respecting the ac- 
commodations of the tavern, we 
were sur])rised to learn their extent, 
and the facility with which they 
are attainable. A bed may be had 
for half a dollar per night, or three 
dollars per week; and, for an ad- 
ditional sum well understood, the 
choice of an attendant to draw the 
curtains/' 

" It is to the hostess's advantage 
that the female assistants in her fa- 
mily should be as handsome as she 
can procure them. Being slaves, 
the only recompense of their ser- 
vices is the food they eat, the 
hard bed they sleep on, and the 
few loose clothes which are hung 
upon them. One privilege, indeed, 
is allowed them, which, you will be 
shocked to know, is that of ten- 
derly disposing of their persons. 
This oilers the only hope they have 
of procuring a sum of money, 
■wherewith to purchase their free- 
dom : it is so common a resource 
among them, that neither shame 
nor disgrace attaches to it ; but, 
on the contrary, she who is most 
sought, becomes au object of envy, 
and is proud of the distinction 
shewn her. 

*' One of our attendants at table 
appeared, both from her conver- 
sation and behaviour, to be very 
superior to her degraded station. 
She had nothing of beauty, nor 
even prettiness of face; but she was 
of good figure, and of respectable 
and interesting demeanour, and, in 
point of intellect, far above her col- 
leagues. Together v.'ilh gentle- 
ness of manner, and an easy, plea- 
sant address, she possesses a degree 
of understanding and ability which 
claims respect. lu principle, and 
in sentiment, she appeared virtu- 
oos; ahd from the frankness of 
|ier replies, it was evident that she 
knew no sen^e of wrong in her con- 
fl^jct. We could not but lament 



that the imperious Iiabits of the 
country did not allow of her being a 
more respectable member of society. 
" Tills woman is the great sup- 
port of the house — the bar-maid, 
and leading manager of the family. 
Her mistress had refused to take 
a hundred guineas for her ; which, 
she assured us, had been offered 
by a gentleman who would have 
purchased her. She has a very 
lively interesting little daughter, a 
Mestee, about four years old. Of 
this child she spakq with great 
tenderness, and seemed to bear it 
all the fond attachment of an af- 
fectionate parent. Yet, as the 
infant was born in'slavery, should 
the mother, by any means, obtain 
her own freedom, she cannot claim 
her child, but must leave it still 
the disposable property of her mis- 
tress, equally liable to be sold^s 
any other piece of furniture in th^ 
house : for, in Barbadoes, the off- 
spring of a woman in slavery be- 
comes the absolute property of the 
owner to whom the mother belong, 
whether it be black, yellow, or 
white ; as the law knows no period 
when the child of a slave shall be 
born ivee, however removed from 
the African: nor can the mother, 
under any circumstances of subse- 
quent liberation, claim her infant 
from its owner, even though it 
should be of fairer skin than the 
fairest European. Thus are the 
natural ties of our species torn 
asunder, and the dearest attach- 
ments and purest affections of fhe 
heart cruelly broken down ! Babes 
are separated from their parents, and 
mothers robbed of their children, 
by this unnatural appropriation of 
human substance !" Vol. I. pp. 114 
—117, 

After mentioning certain most 
indecent practices which are corh- 
njon in the same island of Barba-^ 
does. Dr. Pinckard adds : — 

" You will be more shocked, 
perhaps, than surprised that such- 
like indecencies should be practis- 
ed among the slaves; but you will 



59 



^oin ia my regret that they should 
happen before the eyes of European 
wives, and spinsters ; and will la- 
ment the sad eflfect which the fre- 
quent recurrence of such offensive 
exhibitions must, necessarily, have 
in destroying that modesty and de- 
licacy of sentiment which render 
so truly lovely, while they so much 
embellish the female mind." Vol, I. 
pp. 123, 124. 

After mentioning the practice of 
taking out Negroes on foot to ac- 
company Whites on horseback ; his 
own remonstrances upon it ; and the 
replies of the gentlemen of the 
island. Dr. Pinckard concludes — 
•* Still our European feelings forced 
upon us the wish, that either they 
had been accommodated with 
mules, or we had dispensed with 
their attendance ; and it will re- 
quire a much longer residence 
amidst this new order of things, 
before we shall be able to persuade 
ourselves that our sense of dis- 
quietude was only a misplaced 
humanity." Vol. I. p. 163. 

" In your future good wishes for 
the comfort of the poor Africans, 
forget not to pray that all masters 
may possess hearts as kind, and 
humane, as that which beats in 
the bosom of * Jack Waith.' The 
friendly indulgence of the master 
is amply repaid by the attachment 
of his slaves; and the history of 
Mr. Waith and his gang, may stand 
in everlasting reproach to the self- 
arrogating opinion which maintains 
that Negroes know not the Divine 
sentiment of gratitude, but are most 
treacherous toward the master who 
treats them best." 

" By kind attentions, and occa- 
sional indulgences to his slaves, 
Mr. Waith had so meliorated their 
condition, so softened to thera the 
hardships of slavery, and so im- 
proved their comforts, as to attach 
them to him, by the secure ties of 
atlection and gratitude. The loud 
clang of the whip was seldom heard 
among them, and the smurlinirs oj 
its painful lash iverc scarcelij 
dreaded: for a better principle 



than fear impelled them to their 
duty. Their friendship for their 
master made his interests their own ; 
and their gratitude rendered his 
safety the object of their solicitude, 
and even of their lives. Of this 
he had, in two great instances, 
known the most unequivocal proof; 
one when the Negroes of the es- 
tates had formed a conspiracy to 
rise upon their masters ; the other 
upon an alarm being given that the 
island was attacked by the French! 
On both these occasions the slaves 
of Spendlove voluntarily offered to 
lay down their lives in defence of 
Mr. Waith and his house." Vol. I. 
pp. 197—199. 

" On attempting to lift a pack- 
age to their shoulders, the Negroes 
set about it in an awkward and 
ludicrous manner. Still as no ac- 
cident, nor injury of consequence 
could derive from it, we, who were 
recently from Europe, were quite 
diverted at their fruitless and in- 
competent efforts; but Captain 

J vvho was with us, and had 

resided long enough in the West 
Indies to have accustomed himself 
to the arbitrary treatment of slaves, 
seeing the stupid way in which 
they attempted this new task, im- 
mediately gave one of the poor 
fellows a cruel cut, with a large 
horse-whip, across the face and 
eyes ! We remonstrated with him 
on this unnecessary and unmerit- 
ed severity; and could not but 
mark it, in our minds, as an act of 
wanton"' cruelty." Vol. I. p. 273, 
274. 

" The state of the Negroes in 
Barbadoes varies, as the state of , 
slaves must ever do, according to 
the dispositions and circumstances 
of the master. Under such hu- 
mane and benevolent characters as 
Mr. Waith, and others whom we 
have visited, their situation might 
be envied by the poor of European 
nations! But under severe and 
cruel masters it becomes a state 
of ceaseless vexation and misery." 
Vol.1, pp.294, 295. 

♦* The first specimen of Wcst-In- 



dia slaves which met our observation 
was singularly calculated to impress 
us with sentiments of compassion 
and disgust. It occurred at the 
very moment, too, when the impres- 
sion would be most powerful, and 
consequently it will remain inde- 
lible. Im media tel-y on our corning 
to anchor iti Carlisle Bay, a womaa 
appeared alongside the ship in a 
small boat, with some bad friiit, 
tobacco, salt fish, and other articles 
of traffic. She was rowed by two 
Negroes, who were her slaves. Two 
such objects of human forisi and 
human ndsery had never before 
met our eyes! They were feeble, 
meagre, and dejected — half-starv- 
ed, half-naked, and, io fii-ure, too 
accurately resembling hungry and 
distempered greyhounds ! They 
crouched upon their heels and 
haunches in the boat; Iheir bones 
almostpierced their filthy and erup- 
tive skins; their wasted frames 
trembled with debility; and, while 
their hollow eyes and famished 
countenances rendered them ghastly 
images of horror, their whole ap- 
pearance shocked humanit}', and 
appalled the sight ! Are these, we 
exclaimed, what are called slaves? 
Is this the state to which hun:!an 
beings are reduced in bondage ? 
Afiiicting and cruel indeed ! Well 
may slavery be deemed a curse ! 
Can it be possible that these spec- 
tres once were men 1 Are such 
the objects we are to seel Are 
these the wretched and deplorable 
beings wiio are to appear every 
day, and every hour, before our 
eyes? Forbid it humanity ! Forbid 
it Heaven ! Such was the apostrophe 
of the moment, and I feel a sincei:€ 
gratiticalion in being able to iuforni 
you, that the melancholy subjects 
of this first impression were siot 
correct examples of the general 
mass of slaves. Still it is grievous 
that any such should be seen : but 
we hope to find them only rare in-, 
stances, for we learn that the large 
gangs of Negroes kept by the great 
merchants, and the planters, are 
generally treated with kindness and 



humanity, and appear couteuted 
and in comfort. ""v ; 

" It is easy to distinguish the 
slaves of the opulentand respectable 
inhabitants from those of the poor 
and needy people of the town. 
The latter, being in povertv then*- 
selves, can only give to their Ne- 
groes a scanty allowance of 'food, 
while their indigence induces thea| 
to exact an over-proportion of la- 
bour. Hence the slaves of this 
class of people appear too often 
with sharp bones and hungry sal- 
low countenances, having eruptions 
about the body, and their skins of 
an unhealthy hue. Their general 
appearance indeed is dirty and un- 
wholesome, and strikingly marks 
their neglected state. Want and 
wretchedness are deeply .stamped 
in every line of their , persons ; and 
they may not inaptly be said to 
reseaible the worn out horse ol" 
the starved and jaded ass,, too often 
seen tremblhig under a lieavy bur- 
den, or reeling iri an old tattered 
cart, upon the roads of Eugland." 
Vol. L pp. 29G— 298. ' _ , 

Is not this the evident result of 
the state of slavery — and pre- 
cisely analogous to the condition 
of brute animals under different 
classes of masters in free coun- 
tries 1 But once more: 

" Perhaps nature has not formed, 
nor can the human mind conceive,' 
a being at once so disgusting, and 
so pitiable, as an old half-famished 
Negro woman, of withered frame, 
hobbling about with her loose and 
naked skin hanging shrivelled in 
deep-furrowed wrinkles; and drag- 
ging after her one or both legs 
grown 'into an immense bulk of 
hideous disease— her feet only toe,s,: 
protruding from this huge mass of 
distempered leg I Yet such are the 
objects too often seen upon the 
streets of Bridge-town i ' Vol. I.

Other passages" might be cited^ 
exactly to the same purport; but 
we think v.e have produced 
enough to shew the disingenuous- 
ness of the oian who, presuming,, iQ. 



reproach the Sketches as unfair, has 
himself perverted the whole tenor 
of Dr. Pinckard's observations; — 
enough to justify the appeal to any 
man of common candour, whether 
we did not fairly state the impres- 
sions on Dr. Pinckard's mind, and 
which pervade his book, to have 
been produced not merely by the 
inhumanity of the Dutch colonists, 
but by the general state of Society 
as it respects the Negroes in those 
parts of the West Indies, Dutch 
or English, which he visited; — 
and whether this impression be 
not, that th«! alleviations of sla- 
very are all dependent on the cha- 
racter of the individual master, 
while the evils are radically inhe- 
rent in the system itself. No man 
can read his book with attention 
without perceiving this:— but it is 
peculiarly observable, that the two 
most prominent instances of Negro 
comfort, from which our antagonist 
would palm upon the public his 
general conclusions, arc expressly 
stated to have been out of the 
common road. We have not for- 
gotten or overlooked the passage on 
■which so much stress is laid, (An- 
tidote, No. 1. p. o.); " The sum of 
gratification aftbrded by this de- 
lightful excursion," &c. : but we 
maintain, that it does not destroy 
the importance of Dr. Pinckard's 
testimony against the system of 
slavery, but on the contrary, by 
shewing his freedom from pre- 
possessions, adds to its weight; and 
this is all our concern. Dr. Pinck- 
ard made a tour through an island 
naturally delightful, in agreeable 
company, wiio did all in their 
power to amuse and entertain him. 
He was treated with the greatest 
Ijospitality, and therefore of course 
inclined to think and speak well 
of hib hosts. lie met with indi- 
viduals whom he states as being 
more than usually kind to their 
Negroes*. It is natural that he

mane characters a* Mr. Waith and many 
<Hher8, whom we have visited, their si- 
taation might be envied by the |iocr of

should speak of such an excursion 
as " gratifying and delightful :" but 
does all this reconcile him to sla- 
ve.ry? No. Does it impress on his 
mind that the legal situation of the 
slaves is what it ought to be? No. 
Dr. Pinckard had too much sa- 
gacity not to mark, and too much 
humanity not to deplore, the diffe- 
rence between the insecure tenure 
of any good dependent on the will 
of an absolute master, and the se- 
curity arising out of the sanctions 
of a well-defined law, with proper 
rules of evidence, and impartially 
administered. To attempt to con- 
found these two things, or to re- 
present the dilFerence between 
them as slight or unimportant, is 
weak or wicked in the extreme ; 
betraying cither the most pitiable 
ignorance of the indispensable re- 
quisites to human happiness, or a 
highly reprehensible indifference to 
their being withheld from myriads 
of our fellow-men. That acting, or 
even arguing and thinking, syste- 
matically in this way, has the un- 
fortunate but certain tendency to 
deprave the human heart, we shall 
not waste our readers' time in at- 
tempting to prove; though this our 
Antidotist may probably deny ; for 
it is only supported by the uniform 
doctrine of every moralist, and by 
all experience from the days of 
Homer to our own. We may, per- 
haps, hereafter observe a little on 
the illustration of this principle, 
in one or two striking instances. 

" Oh, but all these facts are 
Dutch, and twenty years old." We 
have already undeniably shewn, 
that Dr. Pinckard's opinions on 
this subject were not drawn from 
sources exclusively Dutch ; ami 
we now proceed to observe, that 
(omitting, at present, any refermce 
to the cases communicated by Lord 
Seaforlh, while (Jovernor of iJarba- 
does,) those of fluggins andliodge 
are neither twenty years old nor ten»

iiients since made, &c. &c. But a White may not be construed into 
simply referring to what we have a provocation, Dx, Pinckard in- 



63 



forms us, that a Barbadian who, 
without any provocalion, had 
struck a Negro a violent blow on 
the head witli a large stick, on his 
remonstrating against lliis and otiier 
ill usage, tiireatened him, *' if he 
looked savage," i. e. if he provoked 
the White by looking savage, " to 
cut him down." Any act of disobe- 
dience is provocalion ; and this act 
is to be described by perhaps the 
master only, or another White in 
his service; — the master's life be- 
ing, on the trial, staked against that 
of an animal recently valued at 
11/. 4s. ! and Negro evidence be- 
ing, as ever, inadmissible ! 

The Assembly of Barbadoes, 
however, it seems, are likely to lake 
up this subject again. I r is to be 
hoped, for the sake of the English 
name, and of human nature, thai 
in the great and respectable As- 
sembly of Barbadoes, which met 
to tile number of nineteen per- 
sons, in order to reject Lord Sea- 
foi til's proposal, by a majority of 3, 
(11 to 8), there will now be found 
an unanimous disposition not to al- 
low murder to be committed with 
impunity, on the jdea of provoca- 
tion; j)erhaps of " looking sulky I" 
In Demarara and Berbice, which 
have been English governments 
ibr upwards of 20 years, and are 
now English colonies, we know (in- 
deed, the Antidotist we ajiprehend 
would admitj that the old and mis- 
chievous prejudices remain in full 
force.; and though many of the 
])Ianlers are of what we suppose he 
woulfl call "the trueDutcli breed," 
yet Mr. Fiscal Jenyns is, we fear, 
an Englishman — and we know his 
deliberate opinion, held forth to all 
the planters, Dutch as well as Eng- 
lish, to be, that the power of the 
master over his Negroes is not to 
be brought into doubt or even 
J)i.sci .ssiON. Mark, reader ! not 
into discuasion. How that autho- 
rity is to be limited which is not 
to be discussed, lei Mr. Justice 
Jenyns, or his liatterer, explain. 
But he says farther, " It should 
never be opposed, or even tkuurt<d, 



by any intermediate authority." So 
that, on " the delightful sentiments" 
and principles " of an English 
judge*," thus publicly avowed, 'if 
the horrid scenes at Lancaster (see 
Sketch, No. V.) had been renewed 
under his own eye when he was 
judge, he must have been guilty of 
a breach of duty had he opposed, 
or even Ihwarted, the monster who 
was lloiiging to death the two mi- 
serable victims whoni he had just 
caught. Now, we will cnnfideiitiy 
ask, woidd such an opinion have 
been given but to men well pre- 
pared to receive it? Is this necessary 
tor the maintenance of the slavery 
system? If it be, let its defenders 
stand forth and say so; but let 
lliem ponder well the conse- 
quences: — if not, let Mr. Justice 
Jenyns defend himself. — The Bri- 
tish Government calls loudly for 
addiiional restrictions on this au- 
thority of the master. The legisla- 
ture of Jamaica, and of Barbadoes, 
seem prepared to enact tliem. Nay,, 
the laws, for amciiorating the state 
of slavery, which at any time hav6- 
been passed in any of the islands, 
fly in the face of Mr. Jer.yns's opi- 
nion ; unless, indeed, he will de- 
fend these imprudent colonial 
legislatures, by alleging with Go- 
vernor Prevost, with the legal 
defenders of Mr. Hodge, &c. &c. 
(and as there has been but too much 
reason to believe true), that those 
laws were never meant to be exe- 
cuted, but merely to blind the 
mother country. But Mr. Jenyns 
has met with an appropriate de- 
fender, just where we should have 
expected, in the person whose re- 
gard for "Christian charity" leads 
him to desire that the ashes of Ar- 
thur Hodge should rest in peace! 
Truc--and why not of Nero antl 
Caligula too ? They have been 
longer dead. We neither wonder 
at such a person's praise of IMr. 
Justice Jenyns, nor at his finding 
sullicient ground tor adulatioi^ 
where wc can see nothing but coii' 
temj)tible prejudice, or a drivtlhl?^

gincl afFccled morality still rriore

guardian of the weak, this admini- 
strator of law and justice, after de- 
precating the interference of the 
law or the iliagistrate between an 
arbitrary master and a defenceless 
slave (which the British Parliament 
Recommends andenjoins),nio'st mag- 
nanimously scruples not — dares— 
to "admonish" masters "that 
there are natural and social obli- 
gatioris," " mutual' relations, and 
reciprocal duties," *^ from which 
they can never deviate without 
dishonour." Did Mr. Justice Je- 
nyns prothulgate these delightful 
«nd sublime sentiments to shew 
the world how deeply he was 
read in the most recondite mys- 
teries of morality? Or did he 
think it necessary thus to instruct,

We really envy not these gentlemen 
their mutual connection, of which 
\ve cannot help surmising that they 
have a pretty strong common bond. 
Indeed, when we attend to the style 
of these Antidotes; their charac- 
teristic malignity, and the objects 
against whoin it is directed ; the 
cunning with which unimportant 
mistakes are spied out, exaggerated 
and dilated On, while not one lead- 
ing or liberal principle of religion 
or morals, or even one comprehen-

the decision of such a question 
must turn, is ever made the subject 
of discussion, scarcely even ad-

gard of truth, if falsehood has the 
smallest chance of answering a mo- 
mentary purpose ; we feel tole- 
rably assured that the Antidote 
can have but one author. 

We shall now, for the present, 
take our leave of Dr.Pinckard, and 
with him, of the first and third 
Numbers of the Antidote. On the 
second, relating to Sir James Leith's 
supposed Aid-de-Camp, there are 
obvious reasons why we should not 
enter just at this moment ; but none 
why vve should not challenge the 
writer of the note at the foot of 
No. III. p. 3. gravely and delibe- 
rately to repeat his accusation, that 
the Directors of the African Institu- 
tion " invented^' that " calumny." Be 
it a caliimny— as false and as black 
as he shall choose to describe it j 
be the African Institution ever so 
blameable for circulating it; we^ 
without hesitation, defy him to de- 
clare, on whatever of character he 
may possess, that he believes the 
assertion he has there so unequi-? 
vocally made. We know that We 
have no right to call on him to disr 
close himself; and that an anony- 
mous writer, who can make any 
assertion, incurs very little farthep 
risk by professing his readiness 
to give it the additional sanction of 
an oath; — but vve have charged, 
w^e do again charge, this persorj 
with a wilful and systematic disre- 
gard to truth ; and we are willing |q 
put it to this issue. He must be 
known to his bookseller, and probia- 
bly is known to many gentlemen (to 
some at least) of his bivn way bf 
thinking. Now let him make an 
oath, or a solemn declaration in 
writing signed with his name (the 
receipt of which his friends shall 

ajid innovatQrs,tand revolutionists, and 
intentional encoiiragfrs of insurrection, 
rebellion, and murder, and destruction 
pf the colonies;— he is perfectly vyel- 
come to all these polemical howls. 
"^ Every animal has its cry." As for the 
Methodists, when any specific and intel- 
ligible charge shall be made against- 
them, they will doubtleps defend th^ms

acknowledge without divulging his 
name) thai he does really and bond 
jida believe his own assertions, and 
we will give up the point ; and, 
though we cannot promise to believe 
him, or that any one el.^e will, we do 
promise never to accuse him again. 
Whether he will do this or not, 
having called his attention to the 
point, we are perfectly ready to 
leave his credit to his own keeping. 
We once more repeat, that his ac- 
count of Dr. Pinckard is best refuted 
by reading Dr. Pinckard ; and his 
representations of the Tortola affair 
(in Number IV. just published) we 
should be perfectly contented to 
leave to the castigation of Gover- 
nor Elliot's own letters. Should we 
hereafter notice them, it will only 
, be because those letters are not in 
the hands of every one. 

But after all, these accusations 
and recriminations, were they 
equally just on both sides, are litlle 
better than trifling, and serve rather 
to put aside, than to bring forward, 
the main question. Let every thing, 
in the treatment of the slaves, for 
which the Anlidotist is disposed to 
contend be granted ; — the Negroes 
of Mr. Dougan or Mr. Holling- 
worth, or twenty others, as happy 
as he would describe them, the 
general treatment mild, the labour 
I exacted moderate, and instances of 
abuse rare — what is the happiness 
which, after all, and in the most 
favoured circumstances, they are 
represented to enjoy'? Precisely 
that of a favoured animal in this 
country, well fed, well housed, well 
clothed ; — but then, on the other 
hand, liable to be worked at the 
master's discretion very slenderly 
conlrouled ; to be punished at the 
same discretion for any fault, real 
or imaginary, up to a pomt quite suf- 
ficient to render his life miserable; 
to be transl'crred to anolher spot, 
or sold, at the master's will, what- 
ever ties of inclination or of nature 
may be thereby broken ; and if 
indulged with a wife, her offspring 
to be the absolute property of 
the master. Is quq word of this 



denied? All is contained in the 
rights of ownership, so perpetually 
and pertinaciously maintained and 
contended for, not merely over the 
slaves in existence, but over their 
issue to the latest posterity. Nor 
do the restrictions on masters, in- 
troduced into the most modern and 
best constructed acts, even sup- 
posing they could be fully and effi- 
caciously enforced up to the very 
letter, secure good treatment to the 
slave, to say nothing of the innu- 
merable methods, within the law, 
by which he may be made perpe- 
tually wretched without redress. 
And if a master chooses to go be- 
yond the law, but with caution, how 
is he to be convicted 1 Be it ever re- 
membered, the slave is no evidence, 
except against his fellow-slave. 
Nay, let it even be siipposed, for 
example, that the law which says 
that a slave shall not be punished 
wilh more than thirty nine lashes at 
one time, by the master, or his 
order, could be enforced ; yet who, 
within thirty-nine, determines the 
number? The master. Who ascer- 
tains the delinquency? The master. 
Who prescribes the degree of seve- 
rity? The master. Who decides 
how soon the punishment may he 
repeated? The master. Even in 
the last Jamaica Act we do not find 
any provision for setting a slave free 
from the severest master, except at 
the discretion of the court only in 
atrocious cases of mutilation. In 
others, the complaining slave, how- 
eversuccessful inestablishing his in- 
jury, and even convicting his master, 
is to be necessarily redelivered into 
the power of the exasperated ty- 
rant, whose former ill usage drove 
him to complain. Is this a danger 
lightly to be incurred? But wh^i 
we take one step farther, and in- 
quire into the evidence which the 
colonial laws aflbrd of their moral 
estimation, what find we? No 
doubt those who desire to have 
their dependants honest, sober, 
virtuous, are careful to have them 
instructed in correspondent princi- 
ples. Those who complain of the 



68 



saYa,^^erress of their nature and ha- 
bits are anxious, by all iraaginabie 
means, to correct and amend such 
habits, and to diminish the dispo- 
sition to indulge thera. Those 
who are panting to increase I he 
population of their estates enact 
laws for the encouragement of mar- 
riage, for the protection of the 
chastity of the women, and dis- 
comitenanee to the uttennost, by 
precept and example, that corrup- 
tiou and profligacy of manners 
which they represent as oue ot the 
most formidable impediments to it. 
The traces of this solicitude wili 
surely appear in the code of each 
island, and must ever Isave done 
so; because they have every where 
been always fievoutiy \vii«hing for 
this consummation ! Alas, what 
a wide blank here presents itself! 
And yet it is not permitted to us to 
doubt either the perfect sincerity, 
or the earnestness, with which the 
work of ameliorating tiie condition 
of the slaves has been prosecuted 
by the colonists and their legisla- 
tive assemblies ! 

, But we must reserve this parti- 
cular subject for a future Sketch ; 
being desirous, at present, of briefly 
noticing the charges with vv'hich the 
author of the Antidote, in common 
with many of his associates, has 
loaded the Missionaries who have 
engaged in the Christian instruction 
of the slave population in the colo- 
nies. Those charges we would 
meet by citing a strong and recent 
testimony in proof of the bene- 
ficial effect of their labours, the 
competency of which the Antidotist 
will not question — we mean that of 
the House of Assembly of Antigua. 
The island of Antigua is the Bri- 
tish colony where attempts to in- 
struct the Negroes in Christianity 
have met with the greatest success. 
There are, in that island, both 
Moravian and Methodist Missions 
of great extent and long standing ; 
and the uuudjer ol Christian slaves 
belonging to the two denominations 
forms a very great proportion of the 
total Black population of the colony. 



On the 25th of July hist, ibe 
House of Assembly of that island 
presented an Address to the Go- 
vernor, in which, after expressing 
their concurrence in some mea- 
sures recommended by his Excel- 
lency for the greater eificiency of 
the militia force, they add the fol- 
lowing; words : — 

" We feel it our duty, notwith- 
standing, to observe to your Ex- 
cellency, that we have never hi- 
therto had occasion to indulge any 
serious apprehensions in regard to 
the slave population of this island, 
but, ou the contrary, have ever}' 
reason to believe, that the lenily 
a!id kind treatment which they ex- 
})crience from their respective pro- 
prietors leave them but litile room 
for discontent ; and that did ar,y 
such feeling imhappily exist, the 
increasing influence oj moral and 
religious principles among them 
would effectually prohibit any rash 
or desperate attempts." 

The sentiments expressed by his 
Excellency, in reply, are also well 
deserving of notice : — 

" The obligaiious of duty are, 
no doubt, greatly strengthened and 
enforced by the sanctions of mo- 
rality and religion ; and I hail with 
heart-felt satisfaction the progres- 
sive difl^usion of their mild and 
benignant principles. They cannot 
fail, when generally disseminated, 
to give you a strong guarantee of 
the obedience, tideiily, and grati- 
tude of those under your protection 
and controul; and no occasion shall 
pass unimproved by me, to extend 
their influence, and consolidate 
yowr security, by enlarging the 
circle of their social virtues." 

These proceedings had their origin 
in the unhappy insurrection which 
lately occurred in the isiand of 
Barbadocs ; the same circumstance 
which has given rise to the mis- 
representations respecting the Mis- 
sionaries, to which we have ad- 
verted. To those misrepresenta- 
tions they present a confutation so 
complete, that it is quite unneces- 
sary to add a single word to it. 



G7 
Such, however, is ilie power of 
prejudice, that in Jamaica the 
Missionaries who are labouring to 
^»riu^ about the same effects which 
the Assembly of Antiguu, speaking 
from their knowledge untl ex)>c- 
Tience of the fact, admit to have 
been so beneficial to the slaves of 
that island, are represented as 
being the mere lire-brands of so- 
ciety. The following is a charge 
delivered to a izrand jury at TilcJi- 
field, in the island of Jamaica, on 
the 11th of July last: — 

" Mr. Forenran and Gentlemen, 
— An evil of much magnitude has 
for some lime existed in this parish, 
and Vihich appears to be daily 



gentlemen, can the genuine know- 
ledge of the doctrine of salvation 
be taught by these illitej-ate fana- 
tics, who profanely pretend to 
teach the holy Scriptures? I think 
not; and it becomes the duty of . 
cveiy magistrate, and it is incum- 
bent on every member of the com- 
niunity, to endeavour to put down 
such a monstrous and uniawftd as- 
sumption of the functions belonging 
to tiie Reverend Ministers of our 
religion ; an evil which threatens 
nuicli danger, whereby the minds 
of the hearers are perverted with 
false, niisiaken, and fanatical no- 
tions, and an opportunity afforded 
them of concerting private and 



gaining ground, to the prejudice of public mischief. Who, gentlemen. 



good order, and subversive of the 
subordination, and injurious to the 
morals of the slave j)opulalion. I 
need scarcely inform you, that I 
allude to the nocturnal visitation 
of idle, itineraut, and pretended 
jireachcrs of the Gospel on estates, 
Mho, by fraud and stratagem, un- 
der the cloak of religion, seduced 
from those hoars consigned by na- 
ture to repose, the weak and infa- 
tuated dupes of 'ihc'iv fravdf til de- 
signs, imposed upon their unin- 
formed and credulous understand- 
ings, by impiously pretending to 
preach the holy Gospel. To this 
evil, gentlemen, it is my duty to 
direct your attention: but mistake 
me not. Far be it from me, indeed, 
to offer any obstacle to the true 
exercise ofrtligiotis worship. Quite 
the contrary — lor if tJiere be one 
function more important than an- 
other, 1 am of opinion it is that of 
training the mind to truth, and of 
inculcating the knowledge of a 
future state, thereby to rescue it 
from the shame, the degradation, 
and the misery of vice, as well as 
to promote its temporal and eter- 
nal welfare, by imjircssing it 
with the kjjowledge of a merciful 
God, with the hope of future re- 
ward, and with the fear of future 
punishmtnl *. I would ask you,

can know — who can define the 
characters, or testify the qualifica- 
tions and real intentions, of those 
unlicensed itinerants? May thev 
not be (I do not say they are) the 
most contemptible hypocrites of the 
lowest class, with religion and 
piety upon their lips, and the 
basest ])assions rankling in their 
hearts 1 May they not be ivreiched 
ill disposed enthusiasts, inflaming 
and alienating the minds of their 
hearers from their duties and em- 
ployments, destructive of their 
health, and creating a discoutenr, 
(before unknown) to that state of 
life in which it has pleased God to 
place them? Who, gentlemen, can 
tell where evils like these may 
stop, unless checked by the arm of 
justice f Who can calculate, in a 
community like this, where tiio 
mass of the Black population is 
credulous and superstitious— who 
can calculate the baneful influenc 
which may be obtained over their* 
minds by those desigtiing hypocri- 
tical impostors, it we look calmly 
on, and lucdiessly permit the un- 
iiilerriiptcd exercise of their j)er- 
nicious arts? These arts must, 
indeed, be checked ; but with 
temperance, moderation, and lirm- 
ness. Theory and experience con-

authenticated instance, in which 
any Moravian or Methodist Mis- 
sionary has been delected in con- 
certing or promoting either public 
or private mischief in the West

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c. 



In our last Number, we directed 
the notice ot our readers to a set of 
pamphlets, in size and type exact 
imitations of our own, entitled "An- 
tidote to theWest-Iudian Sketches ;" 
and we shewed, in a variety of 
instances, how some of the worst 
artifices of controversy had been 
employed, to divert the public at- 
tention from those plain funda- 
mental facts which demonstrate 
the unexampled iniquity of the 
West-Indian system. In giving pub- 
licity to these facts, we felt assured, 
that the hearts and understandings 
of our readers would supply the 
unavoidable inferences from them. 
We did not indeed anticipate the 
approbation of the Colonial Agents 
or their employers, and we are 
neither surprised nor grieved that 
we have failed to obtain it. They 
shrink, and with sufficient reason, 
from the test which has thus been 
offered of the real merits of the 
dispute. It is more consistent with 
their policy to fight the battle on 
other grounds ; to revive refuted 
calumnies, and to reiterate invec- 
tives, which, whether well or ill- 
founded, can never disj)rove the 
fatal accusations advanced against 
the colonial system. 

In having selected this publica- 
tion, from the numerous list of 
pamphlets v\hich have appeared 
on the same side of the question 
during the last year, for a parti- 
cular reply, we may be tiiought to 
give a better proof of discretion 
ihan id' valour; yet its recent dale, 
and llie assiduity with which it has 
been circulated, seem to entitle it 
to a preterence. We would ac- 
knowledge, indeed, and respect, 



in general, the privileges of weak- 
ness, although in this instance 
we may be thought to disregard 
them. 

Many winters have passed over 
our heads since the commencement 
of the great controversy respecting 
ill-fated Africa and her sons; and 
in those years many lessons have 
been impressed on our memories. 
Among these we number a steady 
persuasion of the ultimate triumph 
of truth and justice, and a calm 
conviction that unmerited obloquy 
is the certain but transitory re- 
compense of persevering opposi- 
tion to great national crimes. De- 
rision and reproach, if they are 
not the unfailing evidence of emi- 
nent desert, are at least its almost 
inseparable attendants ; and they 
perform a salutary office in coun- 
teracting the natural vanity of the 
heart and probing its sincerity. 
The West-Indian party have at all 
times, and never more than at pre- 
sent, subjected their opponents to 
this trial. The errors committed 
in theconductof their cause — errors 
which it is hardly consistent with 
human imperfection wholly to avoid; 
— the inaccuracies of expression 
into which they may have fallen ia 
the eager pursuit of their great ob- 
ject,the careless language of friend- 
ly intercourse; and even the trans- 
actions of private life, have been 
tiragged into public notice, ex- 
aggerated, and luistated, with all 
the keenness of vindictive ermiity. 
Ijiit ihcy may safely appeal to th« 
dispassionate judgment of (heir 
country for their vindication ; and 
experience uiay instruct them that 
itsapi)robuiiou — that just reward of 

L2 



72 



upright public serrice — will not be 
^vithheld, because, in their arduous 
struggle against oppression, sup- 
ported by wealth and influence, 
they may occasionally have fallen 
into errors consistent with honest 
intentions, and with conduct essen- 
tially judicious and wise. 

To all the personal abuse of the 
writer of the Antidote, as well as 
of others, we shall be content to 
oppose these general remarks. Let 
him continue with his harsh and 
feeble note to swell the dissonant 
chorus of his fellows : it is a cry 
wbich at once proves his vindic- 
tiveness and his impotence. We 
|)ity the man who knows so little of 
the resolute self-devotion of patriot- 
ism and humanity, as to hope that 
such attacks as these will deter 
any, who have embarked in this 
cause, from its strenuous and per- 
severing prosecution. 

The first of our Sketches was 
taken from the work of Dr. Pinck- 
ard, and described a transaction 
to which it is needless to apply 
any epithets, for hunian language 
is not furnished with terras by 
which such enormities can be ade- 
quately expressed. The scene of 
this tragedy was Demarara. It 
occurred very shortly before the 
conquest of that settlement by 
Great Britain in 179<5. We ex- 
pressly stated the date of this 
transaction, because that was a 
fact of which our readers might 
not otherwise have b6en apprized. 
We did not state, in terms, that 
Demarara had been a Dutch co- 
lony, because we supposed that 
none, who might peruse our work, 
could be ignorant of that fact. 
The author of the Antidote has 
formed a lower estimate of the at- 
tainments of his readers. He, 
therefore, thinks it proper to in- 
form them, in capital letters, that 
Demarara was a Dutch colony, 
governed by Dutch laws, calling 
upon them to observe with what 
** insidious and wilful obliquity" 
the Sketch applies this scene " to 



the present existing state of society 
and feelings in our English^co- 
lonies." 

But is not Demarara noiv an 
English colony, inhabited by 
many of the same generation of men 
who were concerned in this frightful 
transaction ? Was it not to many 
of these very men that Mr. Jenyns, 
the English judge of that colony, 
addressed his famous letter, in 
which he deprecated, in the strong- 
est terms, the smallest interference 
with the authority of the master ? 
And was it of no moment to warn 
the British Parliament and the 
British Public from being so far 
deceived by the representations 
of this judicial functionary, as to 
leave our eighty or ninety thou- 
sand fellow-subjects in Guiana to 
the tender mercies of such men? 
Even our apologist, adopting the 
language of Mr. Brougham, tes- 
tifies of them, that " of all nations 
in the West Indies, they are the 
most inhuman masters." (No. I. 
p. 4.) And then adds, trium- 
phantly, " It is not to Dutch pro- 
prietors, but to English humanity, 
that our slaves are entrusted." 
But we say, in reply, that it is, ac- 
cording to his Own averment, to 
Dutch proprietors, distinguished 
for cruelty, and to the operation 
of Dutch laws, that the destinies 
of the slaves of Demarara and Bei- 
bice are entrusted ; and it was 
partly to establish the criminality 
of reposing such a trust in such 
men that the Sketch was written. 

We supposed that no one, who 
admitted the facts of the case — and 
this writer ddes not dispute them— 
could have missed the lesson they 
were intended to teach. Our op- 
ponent, however, is either obsti- 
nate and will not, or he labours 
under a still heavier infirmity and 
cannot, understand the reasoning 
he reviles. For the sake of this au- 
thor, and of such as may resemble 
him, we will explain more fully the 
conclusions we sought to establish, 
by exhibiting, in conjunction with 



73 



the oppressions practised in British 
colonies, the loathsome picture of 
the manners of the Dutch. 

But we must iirst request our 
antagonist to prosecute still fur- 
ther the ijrufound researches on 
which he has entered. It is much, 
doubtless, to have discovered that 
Demarara was a Dutch settlement. 
But still deeper inquiry may inform 
him, that, though previous to the 
year 1790 it was subject to Hol- 
land, it contained, even at that 
time, a large body of English 
proprietors. And should he pur- 
sue his West-Indian studies with 
the same acuteness which has led 
to his tirst great discovery, he will 
find, tiiat, among the tragedies 
related by Dr. Pinckard as hav- 
ing been acted in Demarara, some 
of the most awful took place on an 
estate which, we have been credi- 
bly informed, was even then oc- 
cupied by an Englishman. 

To return, however, to our 
promised explanation — Since the 
nations of Europe first assumed 
their present intellectual superi- 
ority over the rest of mankind, 
they have been exalted as much by 
humanity as by their power and 
civilization. The causes of this 
moral greatness, and of some par- 
tial departures from it, are beside 
our present purpose. But on the 
shores of Africa and tropical 
America, and throughout the whole 
thain of the Antilles, the European 
character has established no such 
claims to admiration. The natives 
of Christendom have, without dis- 
tinction, been known, in these 
regions, only as the messengers of 
sorrow and desolation. They have 
swept away from these beautiful 
islands one entire species of the 
human race. They have torn from 
Africa many millions of wretched 
captives, to supply the place of 
their tirst victims. Wliole genera- 
tions of these unhappy sufterers 
have successively followed the fate 
. of their more feeble j)rcdecessors, 
j_ Vk'hile Africa has continually sup- 
plied fresh cargoes of her sous and 



daughters to fill the frightful void 
which European avarice has thus 
been as continually producing in the 
creation of God. Among the four- 
teen or fifteen hundred thousand 
Negroes who now cultivate the 
different European settlements in 
the West Indies, (the residue of at 
least five times that number, who 
have been transported thither from 
Africa during the last 200 yeairs), 
comparatively few will be found 
who can shew a Creole descent of 
more than one or two generations. 
In this dreadful series of crimes, 
the natives of England, France, 
Denmark, Holland, Sweden, Spain, 
and Portugal, and those of the 
United States, hav« participated, 
most of them very largely; and 
the present race of Europeans 
still more deeply than their fathers, 
and in defiance of light and know- 
ledge to which their fathers had 
not access. This general fact is, 
alas! beyond the reach of contro- 
versy. Our children's children 
will look back to it with horror; 
and well may we shudder at the 
recollection. Nor can the press 
be ever more usefully employed 
than in fixing the public attention, 
not in general merely, but in detail, 
on this darkest passage in the his- 
tory of mankind. Against the 
Slave Trade itself there will never 
be wanting multitudes in this land 
who will unite with us in protest- 
ing, so long as that abomination 
digraces the world we inhabit. 
Against the colonial system, which 
the Slave Trade has generated, 
and for the support of which it is 
still by some nations carried on, 
we will also Continue to raise our 
voice, until its enormities shall be 
fully understood and appreciated 
by our coinitrymcn. Now, in every 
delineation of this system, it is of 
the utmost moment to mark the 
identity of its features, among 
nations who have scarcely any 
oilier institutions in common. If 
it was in the English colonies only, 
or in the Dutch colonies only, that 
these ferocious cruelties uere per- 



74 



petrated, some defect in the colo- 
nial code of that particular nation, 
or in its administration, misjht be 
assigned as the cause. But when we 
find that the Dutch, the French, the 
Portuguese, the English, tiie Spa- 
niards, botli ©n the African coast 
and in the West Indies, assume 
on this subject one common cha- 
racter; that the crimes of Torfola, 
Barbadoes, Nevis, &c. lind their 
parallel in the Brazils, in Dutch 
Guiana, in Martinique, in the 
Mauritius, in Cuba; the similarity 
of guilt indicates some common 
principle to which it is to be re- 
ferred. However differing in laws, 
descent, manners, and religion, 
the colonists of France, England, 
Holland, &c. wonderfully concur 
in their general estimate and 
treatment of their unhappy bonds- 
men. There is, therefore, under 
all its minor modifications, some 
general evil which pervades the 
general system of the European 
slave colonies; and it is only from 
the discovery and cure of this 
evil that any effectual relief can be 
expected. 

Such was one of the inferences 
which we conceived would naturally 
have been drawn by our readers, 
from the promiscuous introduction 
of instances of oppression occurring 
in Dutch, French, and English co- 
lonies. And had we been required 
to point out the common principles 
which can thus harden alike the 
hearts of these different colonists, 
our answer would have been easy. 
Fear, avarice, and pride, are pas- 
sions which are, each singly, of force, 
when they rule the bosom with ab- 
solute sway, to bring to light the 
most hateful propensitiies of our 
nature. When united, and en- 
trusted with unlimited dominion, 
they are capable of converting 
men into fiends. — Tiie West-Indian 
colonists dread their slaves ; and 
all history proves to us, that fear is 
one of the most cruel passions of 
the human mind, and renders its 
subjects strangers to remorse and 
mercy. In the eager pursuit of 



wealth, too, selfishness (witness the 
whole history of the new world) 
operates under its most active and 
malignant form; and where ade- 
quate restraints are wanting, he who 
is possessed of this fatal spirit re- 
gards his fellow creatures as his 
instruments or his rivals — as in- 
struments to be employed without 
justice or pity, or as rivals to be 
subdued by craft or terror. But 
pride, the ruling passion of our 
common nature, is of all our pas- 
sions the most destructive of the 
sympathy and compassion which 
ought to alleviate the sorrows of 
life. He who lives under its do- 
minion is happy in proportion to 
the distance between himself and 
other men. Tlieir humiliation 
constitutes his greatness, and his 
own imaginary dignity is increased 
by the contrast. Is it denied 
that the colonists of the West 
Indies are justly included in this 
humiliating delineation? Will our 
apologist argue, that they form a 
bright exception to the general 
rule ? Some of their most vaunted 
writers have spoken of the Negm 
race as an inferior species. Mr. 
Long, the historian of Jamaica, is 
even argumentative on the subject; 
and in colonial societies at this very 
day, we are well assured that the 
same language is openly and con- 
fidently held. In Antigua, for in- 
stance, to mark the depth of this 
feeling (a feeling by no means con- 
fined to Antigua), the bodies of 
these outcasts, nay, even of free 
People of Colour, must not be 
interred near the sacred ashes of 
White men, but must be laid in the 
place allotted to felons. 

To the operation, then, of the 
passions of fear, avarice, and pride, 
we refer as the solution of this 
problem. Nor do we give this as 
a picture of West-Indians only, but 
of human nature universally, when 
placed in circumstances equally 
disadvantageous. In support of 
its accuracy, we would cite every 
page of authentic history in every 
age and nation of the world. 



7r. 



Wherever these passions are called 
into powerful action, unrestrained 
by prompt and adequate external 
autlioritv, whether it be in the 
West Indies or elsewhere, their 
influence will blast the peace and 
happiness of society. 

It was not, then, from " insidious 
and wilful obliquity" that we applied 
the scene acted in Demarara, " to 
the existing state of society and 
feeling in our English colonies." 
It served to shew that such trans- 
actions were not confined to Eng- 
lish colonies*; to prove that their 

* We concluded that all our readers 
were familiar with a similar tragedy 
formerly acted in an English colony, 
and related with singular sang froid by 
Mr. Bryan Edwards, in his History of 
Jamaica. In the year 1760, a rebellion 
broke out in that island on two adjoin- 
ing estates in the parish of St. Mary's; 
the one belonging to the late Mr. Bal- 
lard Beckford, and the other to the 
author's own uncle, Mr. Bayly. " On 
these plantations," he observes, " were 
upwards of 100 Gold Coast Negroes 
ii^wly imported, and I do not believe 
that an individual amongst them had 
received the least shadow of ill treat- 
ment from the time of their arrival 
there. Concerning those on the Friendly 
estate, I can pronounce of my own 
knowledge that they were under the 
government of an overseer of singular 
tenderness and humanity. His name 
was Abraham Fletcher; and let it be 
remembered, in justice even to the 
rebels, and as a lesson to other over- 
seers, that his life was spared from re- 
spect to bis virtues. The insurgents had 
heard of his character from the other 
Negroes, and suflered him to pass 
through tiiem unmolested. Thisfact ap- 
peared in evidence. Having collected 
themselves in a body about one o'(;lock in 
the morning, tliey proceeded to tlie fort 
at Port Maria, killed the sentinel, and 
provided themselves witii as great a 
quantity of arms and ammunition as they 
could conveniently dispose of. Being 
by this time joined by a muniber of their 
countrymen from the neighbouring 
plnntationi, they marclied up tlie higli 
road tliat led to the interior |)artsof tlic 
couhtry, carrying dcatli and dcstraction 
as they went. At Ballard's Valley tliey 
surrounded the overseer's house about 



cause was to be found not in the 
peculiar circumstances of any set- 
tlement, but in the common and 
general constitution of all ; and 
thus to probe the mischief to the 
quick, with a view to ascertain its 
approjiriate remedy. 

We have already hinted at a 
further object which we had in 
relating, on Dr. Piuckard's autho- 
rity, this and other instances of 
Dutch inhumanity. Demarara and 
Berbice are now become English 
colonies; and, taken togetlicr, they 
are second in importance to none 

four in the morning, in which, finding 
all the V/hite servants in beds, they 
butchered every one of them in the 
most savage manner, and literally drank 
their Ijlood mixed with rum. At Eshei" 
and other estates, they erchibited the 
same tragedy, and then set fire to the 
building and canes. In one morning 
they murdered between thirty and forty 
Whites and Mulattoes, not sparing even 
infants at the breast, bef.ire their pro- 
gress was stopped. Tacky, the chief, 
was killed in the woods by one of the 
parties that went in pursuit of tiiem; 
but some others of the ringleaders being 
taken, and a general inclination to revolt 
appearing among all the Koromantyn 
Negroes in the island, it was thought 
necessary to make a few terrible ex- 
amples of some of the most guilty. Of 
three who were clearly proved to have 
been concerned in the murders com- 
mitted at Ballard's Valley, one was con- 
demned to be burnt, and the other 
two to be hung up alive in irons, 
and left to perish in that dreadful 
situation. The wretch that was 
burnt was made to sit on the ground, 
and his body being chained to an iron 
stake, the fire was applied to his feet* 
He uttered not a groan, and saw his 
legs reduced to ashes with the utmost 
firnmess and coni|)osure; after which, 
one of his arms by some mcians getting 
loose, he snatched a brand from the 
fire that was consuming him, and flung 
it in the face of tlie executioner. The 
two that were hung u|) alive were in- 
dulged, at their own request, with a 
hearty meal inuuediately before they 
were suspended on the gil)l)et, which 
was erected in the parade of the town 
of Kingston. From that time, until they 
expired, they never uttered the least 



16 



of bar West Indian possessions but 
Jamaica. While these settlements 
Were held merely as a conquest — 
as a temporary not as a permanent 
possession — it seemed a less im- 
perious duty to attempt ameliora- 
tions which would of course have 
expired with the authority which 
bad established ihem. The Anti- 
dotist himself admits the inhuma- 
nity of the Dutch colonists, and 
seems to concur with us in pro- 
testing against committing to their 
discretion the lives and happiness 
of the slaves. A large body of 
these colonists have now become 
British subjects. But, by the 
mere transfer of allegiance, they 
have not probably acquired that 
tenderness of nature which he so 
lavishly ascribes to English West- 
Indians. If, while subject to Hol- 
land, the planters of Demarara and 

complaiBt, except only of cold in the 
■Bight, but diverted themselves all day 
long in discourse with their countrymen, 
who were permitted, very improperly, 
to surround the gibbet. On the seventh 
day, a notion prevailed among the spec- 
tators that one of them wished to com- 
municate an important secret to his 
master, my near relation ; who being in 
St. Mary'^s parish, the commanding offi- 
cer sent for me. I endeavoured, by 
means of an interpreter, to let him know 
that I was present, but I could not un- 
derstand what he said in return. I re- 
member, that both he and his fellow- 
snfferer laughed immoderately at some- 
thing that occurred, I know not what. 
The next morning one of them silently 
expired, as did the other on the morn- 
ing of the ninth day." 

The above extract will serve as a re- 
ply to that part of the Antidote which 
would insinuate that the scene acted at 
Demarara had no parallel in the his- 
tory of our English colonies. But this, 
it will be said, was in the year 1760. Yes ; 
but happily there has been no insur- 
rection in Jamaica since that period; 
and the discussions which began in 
England in the year 1787, have no less 
happily led to the abolition by law in 
that island of such tremendous inflic- 
tions. The recent history of Dominica 
and Barbadoes, however, will perhaps 
furnish materials for some farther re- 
aiarks on this general subject. 



Berbice were if^ally (to nse th* 
words which he quotes with ap- 
probation,) '• the most inhumanr 
masters," they, of course, continue 
inhuman still. If the law under 
which they formerly lived was in- 
effectual to restrain their admitted 
ferocity, they must remain as much 
exempt from controul now as ever, 
because we have not as yet esta- 
blished, in these new acquisitions, 
any one solitary regulation for the 
protection of the slaves. We exhi- 
bited, therefore, the proofs of their 
inhumanity, and called on Parlia- 
ment to exert its authority in ap- 
plying the remedy. Our premises 
are undisputed. The inference 
from them is most important, and 
seems to us to follow by the most 
sinjple process of reasoning. We 
pointed out crimes at once dread- 
ful and remediable, and only asked 
that the remedy might not be 
withheld. To the Antidotist all 
this appears only " ijisidious and 
wilfid obliquity." 

But the first of our Sketches had. 
yet another practical tendency? 
English judges have, for some 
years past, occupied the courts in 
which the jurists of Holland for- 
merly presided. We acknowledge, 
and rejoice to acknowledge, tFiat 
the chief judge lately appointed to 
Demarara, as well as his predecessor, 
is a man of rare accomplishments 
both moral and intellectual. But 
in the proceedings of Mr. John 
Clayton Jenyns, we saw what we 
conceived to be urgent cause for 
apprehension. The contrast be- 
tween the former, and the recent, 
language of that gentleman is in 
itself only ludicrous. It was na- 
tural enough that he who thought 
the constitution of Great Britain 
an usurpation on the rights of manj 
should regard any restrictions on 
the pure unmitigated tyranny of a 
Dutch planter ati intolerable hard- 
ship. But absurdity in men oc- 
cupying high official stations is 
never innoxious. When we found 
the second fiscal, one of the cri- 
minal judges of Demarara, publicly 



77 



avowing, in the heart of that colony, 
his opinion that t||e weakness of 
domestic anthority needed the sup- 
port of magisterial power; that 
the same hand which bore the 
scourge ought to be entrusted with 
the fasces; and that one human 
being ought to exercise over a num- 
ber of his fellow-creatures, these 
tremendous powers, unthwarted and 
unopposed " by any intermediate 
authority;' — and when we furtli^r 
understood that the population to 
whom this teacher of the rights of 
man addressed his lessons, pur- 
chased them with avidity and ex- 
toiled them with eagerness ; we 
thought there was reasonable cause 
for apprehension. We remembered 
the practical commentaries on si- 
milar tenets which we had learnt 
from tlie Barbadian atrocities com- 
municated by Lord Seaforth, and 
from the oppressions of Huggins 
and Hodge. We trembled for the 
fate of up-ards of eighty thousand 
slaves, our fellow-subjects, contain- 
ed in British Guiana; and we felt 
it to be our duty to expose so 
audackms an attack on the sound- 
est maxims of civil government, and 
the first principles of justice and 
humanity. And though the writer 
of the Antidote cannot compre- 
hend this ; though he, in common 
with Mr, Jenyns, feels for the wound- 
ed honour of the planters who 
are injuriously supposed to need 
some controul in the use of their 
absolute power over other men; we 
cannot think that we rendered an 
ill service, either to the real honour 
and welfare of these planters, or to 
the interests of our country, in 
making a strenuous protest against 
doctrines so outrageously despo- 
tical. 

We see, then, little occasion for 
the vehement exclamation of our 
opponent, " that the sins of the 
Dutch in Demarara are to be visited 
on the heads of Englishmen, who 
are eminently humane, both indi- 
vidually and as a nation!'' Let 
the passage be quoted ia which 



we have imputed to Englishmen 
those crimes which tlie Dutch have 
committed, or in which we have 
denied the general humanity of our 
counlrymen. On the contrary, it 
is to the general and tried huma- 
nity of the people of England that 
we confidently make our appeal on 
this occasion, against that com- 
paratively small number of per- 
sons, who would resist the attempt 
effectually to mitigate the sutleriugs 
of their uuhappy bondmen. 

The , second general charge 
against ns is, the suppression of 
passages in Dr. Pinckard's volumes 
which contradict the views we liave 
given, from the same writer, of colo- 
nial slavery. To this we have alrea- 
dy, perhaps, sufnciently replied in 
our last Sketch. We will, however, 
add a few words more. 

From the p<iblications of Dr. 
Pinckard our opponent has extractT 
cd two passages, in which that gen^ 
tieman speaks in strong terms of the 
happy condition of West-Indian 
slaves. Of these, the first relates 
to the Negroes on the estate of the 
late Mr. Dougan, a British planter, 
then settled in Berbice. Now, in 
our Third Sketch (p. 27), we our- 
selves had previously quoted this 
very passage. We had there held 
up the very same picture to the 
admiration of our rea.<lers. But 
we added to the statement a fact 
which it does not suit our antago- 
nist to notice. We observed, that on 
Mr. Dougan's death, his once happy 
Negroes, who had found in the 
paternal tenderness of thatexcellent 
man a refuge from the ordinary, 
evils of colonial bondage, passed 
into other hands ; and that they 
were then called to endure the com- 
mon lot of their countrymen, em- 
bittered by recollections of past 
enjoyment, and deriving iV()m ihe 
former lenity of thcjir deceased 
master an acuter sense aiid a more 
exquisite capacity . of suffering* 
It is one of llie sad peculiarities 
of thia system, that it can thus 

M 



78 



eventually convert even the alle- 
viations it affords into sources of 
afreravated distress. 

On whom, then, rests the crime 
of unfair suppression ; — on us, who 
cited the history,with this its melan- 
choly supplement ; or on him, who 
exhibits the first fair sketch of this 
picture, because it appears to con- 
firm his own opinions, while he 
throws a veil over the concluding 
touches, which have obliterated its 
beauty 1 

It is with deliberation we say, 
that even the early part of this 
story appears only to confirm the 
doctrines of our Antidotist. He 
cannot revere more cordially than 
ourselves the conduct of Mr. Dou- 
gan. It is indeed hardly possible, 
for any man who has lived from in- 
fancy in this happy land, where 
the very prejudices and fashion, as 
well as principles, of society concur 
to enforce the social virtues ; where 
not only religion and morals, but even 
ambition and vanity, are made sub- 
servient to the interests of humanity, 
to understand adequately the merit 
of such a character. He was un- 
touched by the contamination which 
surrounded him. The healthful 
temper of his mind resisted the con- 
tagion of example. He was just 
and liberal, tender and condescend- 
ing to his slaves, though he lived 
in the West Indies. — Such, in sub- 
stance and effect, is the eulogium 
of Dr. Pinckard. " Not satisfied 
with bestowing upon his Negroes 
mere food and raiment, Mr. Dou- 
gan establishes for them a kind 
of right." " He fosters them with 
a father's care."^ He not only " fed, 
clothed, and tenderly watched them 
in sickness," but " he assures 
to them certain property, endea- 
vours to excite feelings of emulation 
among them, and to inspire them 
with a spirit of neat nessand order not 
commonly known among Blacks.'* 
Since his departure from England, 
Dr. Pinckard had not experienced 
" such heartfelt pleasure as in wit- 
nessing" this scene. And why] Be- 

£ M " 



cause it greeted his eyes like an Oasis 
in the desert. And yet let it be re- 
membered, that even the peculiar 
comforts and the singular " kind 
of right," which called forth such 
a strain of feeling and animated 
eloquence from Dr. Pinckard, and 
on which the Antidotist dwells 
with such exultation, were held by 
the slaves on the short and preca- 
rious tenure of the life and pro- 
perty of their master. Not his 
death only, but even a legal exe- 
cution against him, might tear 
these happy beings for ever from 
their homes, their parents, their 
children, their hopes, their pro- 
perty, and their country. In what 
other country in the world, inha- 
bited by European proprietors, 
would this benevolent traveller 
have regarded such a state of 
things as this with the complacency 
it justly excited in him when found 
in the West Indies? 

The other passage in favour of 
West-Indian humanity, which our 
opponent, charges us with sup- 
pressing — an opinioti expressed 
by Dr. Pinckard before he had 
been more than five weeks in the 
West Indies, and contradicted, as 
we have shewn, by his maturcr 
judgment — we have already amply 
considered in our last Sketch. 
For our own parts we feel no 
dilticulty in justifying the omission 
of the passage in question. We 
were not then engaged in a critical 
examination of Dr. Pinckard's opi- 
nions, or of his inferences from the 
facts he had witnessed. We had 
to do only with the facts themselves. 
We appealed to him as a witness, and 
not as a reasoner. With the most 
perfect reliance on his accuracy 
in the relation of such incidents as 
fell under his own observation, we 
might even be allowed to dispute 
the soundness of the opinions he 
deduced from them. Had we 
quoted the immature sentiments, 
which we are arraigned for sup- 
pressing, we should have been 
obliged to go into a detailed dis^ 



liy 



cussioD, to shew their inconsistency 
not only with the general current 
of his facts, but with the opinions 
on the subject of West-Indian 
slavery which he afterwards ex- 
pressed. Such a course would 
have served no other purpose than 
that of diverting the attention of 
our readers from the awful facts 
•which we wished to submit to their 
consideration. And we do not 
marvel that our antagonist should 
be displeased that we did not thus 
weaken the force of those heart- 
rending statements. 

It was not, then, from any desire 
to get rid of hostile testimony, but 
from the resolution to abstain from 
all irrelevant and unnecessary con- 
troversy, that We omitted to quote 
this part of Dr. Pinckard's book. 
But we have already shewn, in our 
last Sketch, what is the real bearing 
of Dr. Pinckard's testimony : we 
shall therefore dismiss the subject 
with a single remark, which the in- 
telligent reader will perceive to 
carry with it a reply to many of tiie 
charges preferred against us by the 
author of the Antidote, 

In order to establish the liability 
of any given system to abuse, and 
the consequent necessity for some 
remedial or preventive regulation, 
it is only requisite that that liability 
should be proved by unquestioned 
evidence ; and it would bp no 
answer to such evidence to say, 
that a vast variety of instances 
could be cited in wh'ph no abuse 
had taken place. If. for example, 
in the acjminiitralion of the finances 
it could be shewn, even in a few 
cases, that gross peculations had 
occurred, it would not be deemed 
either a good set-off to such proof, 
or a valid reason for not instituting 
additional checks, that many more 
instances might be j)roduce(l in 
which no delincjuency could be 
imputed. Nor could it, willi jus- 
tice, be charged as uufairness in 
the person who, with a view to the 
apj)licalion of an cthcicnt remedy, 
should demonstrate those frauds in 
the case of ten individuals, that he 



had left unnoticed tM'} ^v %/eniy, 
or a hundred, instances in which 
no fraud could be proved, or in 
which the conduct had been ex- 
emplary and upright ; nor would 
the necessity for a remedy, if a 
remedy could be applied, be 
thereby disproved. The applica- 
tion of this principle to the case in 
hand is suthciently obvious. We 
accused the West-Indian system of 
great liability to abuse, and we 
produced proofs of that charge 
which are undeniable. It surely 
would be unjust to withhold the 
remedy, merely because various 
instances may be specified in 
which no abuse has existed ; or to 
charge us with unfairness, though 
we have proved all we professed 
to prove, because we did not par- 
ticularly specify those instances; 
and still more because we have not 
given any weight to vague and 
general opinions, in opposition to 
facts*. 

It was not our intention to have 
said one word in reply to the abuse 

* Tlie Antidotist affects to be very 
severe, on what he calls a wilful false- 
hood, stated in the Sketches. We men- 
tion it rather to shew the desperate 
shifts to which he is driven, than from 
any apprehension that an explanation 
is necessary. — In our Sketch No. III. 
(p. 26), speaking of the outrage com-" 
mitted on the person of an unotfending 
Negro, by the order of the fiscal of Ber- 
bice, we remark ; " And in what light 
does the result of Ur. Pinckard's hu- 
mane interposition place the good faith 
and justice of the parties concerned, 
notnierely of the unfeeling complainant, 
but of the judge commissioned by his 
Majesty," Sec. The Antidotist asserts, 
that we knew that the judge was not 
commissioned by his Majesty, and there- 
fore we stated what we knew to be false. 
We reply, that the expression, " com- 
missioned by his Majesty,'' meant neither • 
M!ore nor less than acting under autho- 
rity derived from his Majesty. Berbice 
was then a British possession, under his 
Majesty's allegiance; and the whole ad- 
ministration of its atlairs therefore ne- 
cessarily emanated from him, or from 
those to whom bis authority was dele- 
gated.

heaped on the African Institution, 
on account of the statement which 
it published respecting an Aid-de- 
camp of Sir James Leith. On re- 
considering the subject, however; 
V'e are induced to make a few brief 
remarks 'upon it. It is obvious, 
then, that if all tiie errors and crimes 
Avhich the Antidotist has imputed 
to that body were fully proved, it 
would not invalidate either a single 
fact, or a tittle of the reasoning, con- 
tained in the West-Indian Sketches. 
The facts there detailed do not 
rest on the autiiority of that So- 
ciety. The inferences founded on 
them would not be less legitimately 
deduced, if ihe Institution were 
suppressed to morrow as a public 
nuisance. Why, then, introduce 
hito the Antidote charges which, 
whatever may be their justice, can 
never impugn one iota of the rea- 
soning to which they are opposed 1 
Simply because the author has 
discovered the weakness and the 
danger of his ground ; because 
he is driven to substitute invec- 
tive for argument ; and because 
he thus hopes to enlist the bad 
passions of our nature in a cause to 
which no generous feeling can ever 
be allied. But we little understand 
the nature of Englishmen if such a 
course will succeed. They do not 
e?i:pect in any body of men an ex- 
emption from accidental errors, 
connected neither with wilful per- 
versity nor with corrupt intention. 
Their humanity has not been ac- 
quired in the same school as that 
of the Antidotist. 

Tlie sum of his accusation is, 
tliat a narrative has been printed 
in one of the Reports of the Afri- 
can Institution, which contains an 
unfounded imputation on an Aid- 
decamp of Sir James Leith. That 
the statement was untrue, is ad- 
mitted. How, then, stands the 
fact? The Directors of the Afri- 
can Institution assert, that their 
information was derived from a 
correspondent of whose general 
accuracy they had numerous proofs. 
There was nothing, therefore, in 



the channel through which this in- 
telligence reached them to excite 
distrust of its truth. Did the nar- 
rative, then, carry within itself its 
own refutation? Was it either im- 
possible or improbable? Was it a 
thing incredible in itself, that in a 
West-Indian island a pregnant Ne- 
gress should have been cruelly 
flogged, and that the prosecution 
of the criminal should have been 
unsuccessful ? Now we put it to 
any candid man to say, whether any 
thing short of extreme scepticism 
would have excited a doubt as to 
the authenticity of such a narra- 
tive, proceeding from such a source. 
It was circumstantial : it afforded 
the means of its own refutation: it 
referred to legal proceedings, the 
existence of which, had they taken 
place, must have been matter of 
notoriety: it had all the apparent 
precision and distinctness of truth. 
Still it may be argued, that the fact 
itself was so revolting to humanity, 
(hat common charity should have 
taught the Institution to discredit 
so unnatural a tale. Happy that 
country where the force of this 
objection is strongly felt ! But 
they who urge it should remember 
that Huggms and Hodge resided 
Avithin the limits of the same go- 
vernment with this reported de- 
linquent. They should remember, 
also, that down to the year 1798, 
when, in cons^equence of an address 
to that effect from the House of 
Commons to his Majesty, the Co- 
lonial Legislature of Antigua was 
induced to revise its Statute Book, 
the following enactment remained 
the law of that island : — " Whereas 
several cruel persons, to gratify 
their own humours, against the 
laws of God and humanity, fre- 
quently kill, dismember, and de- 
stroy their own and other persons' 
slaves, and have hitherto gone un- 
punished, because it is inconsistent 
with the constitution and govern- 
ment of this island, and would be 
too great a countenance and en- 
couragement to slaves to resist 
White persons, to set slaves so far 



m 



npon equality with the free inhabi- 
tants as to try those who lull ihem 
for their lives; nor is it known or 
practised in any of the Caribbee 
Islands, that any free person killini; 
a slave is liable for his life ; but 
particular laws, of which we are 
not provided, are made in several 
of them for punishing the aforesaid 
crimes, and are found very effectual 
iu deterring persons from such 
crimes : Be it therefore enacted, 
&c. That if any free person or per- 
sons whatsoever shall wilfully kill, 
or cause to be killed, any slave 
wiial soever, either belonging to 
himself or anotlier, in any such 
manner as is not excusable by the 
laws of Great Britain, or allowed 
by the laws of the island, whether 
the same be by excessive punish- 
ment or otherwise, or shall geld or 
disniemher any such slave, that 
then such person or persons shall 
be prosecuted, &c. and upon con- 
viction of any such killing, the 
offender or ofi'enders shall be fined 
each in any sum not under 100/. 
nor exceeding 300/. lawful money 
of this island, and be imprisoned 
until such hne be paid and all due 
fees, and find security for their 
good behaviour for one year: and 
in case of gelding or dismembering, 
and conviction thereof, the ofi'ender 
or offenders sliall not be fined in 
any sum under 20/. nor above 
100/. lawful money of this island, 
and be imprisoned in the conimon 
gaol until the same be paid, and 
find sureties for his good behaviour 
for a year; so as tiie prosecution 
be commenced in one year after 
the offence of killing, gelding, or 
maiming was comuiilted, and not 
after; and shall likewise pay double 
damage or costs to the parties ag- 
grieved," &c. — [See Laws of An- 
tigua, published in London in 1805, 
Vol. ii. p, 2JU).] 

An 1 if iiio Directors, after having 
read this awful recital, had next 
inquired whether the legislature of 
Antigua, disgusted with the atro- 
cious wickedness of ihcir prede- 
cessors, bad purged their Statute* 



Book for ever, not only from this 
but from all similar enactments^ 
they would have found, by turn- 
ing to Vol. i. p. 150, of the same 
work, that by a law still in force, 
" if any sturdy slave should im- 
prudently strike or oppose any 
Wl'.ite person," he may be publicly 
whipped at the discretion of the 
court; and " if such White person 
be an?/ ivay hurt, wounded, or dis- 
figured by any slave's resistance, 
such offending slave or slaves 
shall have thdr nose slit, or any 
member cut off, or be punished 
with death," at the same discre- 
tion; " always excepting that such 
slave do not the same by his or 
her owner's or master's order." 

And if they were to prosecute 
their researches farther, they might 
discover in the same work (Vol. ii. 
p. 36), that by the 37th clause of the 
Leeward Island Meliorating Act, it 
is enacted, " that any owner of any 
female slave within the Leeward 
Island who shall be Jive months 
gone ivith child, shall detain such 
slave on the estate to which she 
belongs, and employ her only iir 
light work." During the first five 
months of her pregnancy, therefore, 
she may, by direct implication, be 
legally employed in heavy field- 
work, and may be urged to her 
labour, in common with all other 
field slaves, by the lash of the dri- 
ver, like the beasts of the field. 

Was it then, in itself, a strange 
or incredible thing, that a pregnant 
woman should have been cruelly 
flogged, in an island where, nine- 
teen J ears ago, so execrable a sta- 
tute as that we have first quoted 
was still in force; where the second 
act to which we have referred is 
law at this hour; and where even' 
theAct of Amelioration, the subject 
of so many boasts, abandons, for 
the first five months of pregnancy, 
every female slave to a state of 
constant field labour conducted un- 
der the impulse of the lash? 

Lei, then, ihe Antidotist exult on 
this adiuitted mistake of the Afri- 
can Institution. But let him be

very concise and defective. The 
truth is, that nothing has given tiii^

A Mr. Colbeck, who lived ovet-- 
seer on Cabbage tree plantation, in 
St. Lucy's parish, " had bought a 
netv Negro Boy out oj the yard," 
(meaning the slave yard where Ne- 
groes were exposed to sale, in the ^' 
same manner as the cattle and sheep " 
in Smithfield market), and carried 
him home. Conceiving a liking to '' 
the boy, he took him into the house '" 
and made him wait at table. Mr. 
Crone, the overseer of Rowe's estate, 
which is near to Cabbage-tree plan- 
tation, was in the habit of visiting - 
Mr. Colbeck, had noticed the boy "^ 
and knew him well. A fire hap- ^

indignant but hopeless expression of 
injury which overspread the t«atures of 
this poor slave as he retired! He felt 
aggrieved, and was conscious that he 
had hO remedy— no appeal P

pening one night in the neighbour- 
hood, Colbeck went to give his as- 
sistance, and the boy followed him. 
Colbeck, on his return home, missed 
the boy, ^vho had lost his way ; and 
as he did not make his appearance 
the next day, he sent round to his 
neighbours, and particularly to 
Crone, informing them, that his 
African lad had strayed, that he 
could not speak a word of English, 
and possibly he might be found 
breaking some sugar canes, or 
taking something else for his sup- 
port : in which case he requested 
they would not injure him, but 
send him home, and he would pay 
any damage the boy might have 
committed. After a lapse of two 
or three days, the poor creature 
was discovered in a gully (or deep 
water course)near to Rowe's estate; 
and a number of Negroes were soon 
assembled about the place. The 
boy naturally terrified with the 
threats, the noise, and the appear- 
ance of so many people, retreated 
into a hole in a rock, having a stone 
in his hand ; for the purpose, pro- 
bably, of defence. By this time 
Crone, and some other White per- 
sons, had come up. By their or- 
ders ajire was put to the hole where 
the hoy lay, who, when he began to 
he scorched, ran from his hiding 
place into a pool of water whichwas 
near. Some of the Negroes pur- 
sued him into the pool ; and the 
boy, it is said, threw the stone 
which beheld in his hand atone of 
them. On this, two of the White 
men. Crone and Hollingsworth, 
fired at the hoy several times with 
shot, and the Negroes pelted him 
with stones. He was at length 
dragged out of the pool in a dying 
condition ; for he liad not only re- 
ceived several hruises from the 
atones, hut his hreast was so pierced 
with the shot that it was like a 
cullender. The White savages (this 
is the language of Mr. Atlorney- 
General Beccles) ordered the Ne- 
groes to dig a grave. Whilst they 
tcere digging it, the poor creature 
inad^t^ signs of begging J or wattr. 



which was not given to him : hut 
as soon as the grave was dug, he 
was thrown into it and covered over, 
and, as is believed, while yrt 
ALIVE. Colbeck, the owner of the 
boy, hearing that a Negro had been 
killed, went to Crone to inquire 
into the truth of the report. Crone 
told him, that a Negro had been 
killed and buried, but assured him 
it was not his, for he kneiv him well, 
and he need not he at the trouble 
of opening the grave. On this, 
Colbeck we?it aivay satisfied! 
Receiving, however, further infor- 
mation, he returned and had the 
grave opened, when he found the 
murdered Negro to be his own. 
Colbeck brought his action of da- 
mages in the courts of the island 
against Crone and Hollingsworth. 
The cause was ready to be tried, 
and the Court had met for the 
purpose, when they thought proper 
to pay double the value of the boy, 
and 25/. for the use of the island, 
(being 5/. less than the penalty 
fixed by law, of 15/. currency each,) 
rather than suffer the business to 
go to a hearing. " This, I am 
truly sorry to say," observes the 
Advocate-General, " was the only 
punishment which could be inflicted 
for so barbarous and atrociousm 
crime." 

This horrid recital seems to re- 
quire little comment. One circum- 
stance of it, however, may not strike 
the minds of some readers with its 
due force, although it appears to 
be the most affecting part of the 
whole case. Colbeck, it is said, on 
hearing that it was not his slave 
who had been murdered, v/ent 
AWAY satisfied! The preced- 
ing part of the narrative had pre- 
pared us to e.\[)ect in Colbeck 
some approximation to Europeau 
ff cling. But wiiat is the fact? On 
being coolly told that a Negro had 
been killed and buried — told so bV "" 
his neighbour, the nmrderer — is he"^' 
shocked? Docs he express arjy/'' 
horror or indignation on the occa?,',''» 
siou? No! he goes away ,s/7//.v/tc<//JE,j,g

to this one circumstance, aiid he 
will be convinced that a state of 
society must exist in the West In- 
dies of which, as an inhabitant of 
this happy island, he can scarcely 
form any adequate conception. 
Suppose, instead of a Negro slave, 
that it had been a horse which had 
been thus killed. Col beck, had his 
horse happened to be missing at 
the time, would have pursued ex- 
actly the same steps, and would 
have been affected in the same way 
as in the present instance. The 
moral perceptions and feelings 
which prevail in that quarter of the 
world, it will be perceived, are dif- 
ferent from those on this side of 
the Atlantic. Even Mr. Colbeck, 
comparatively a man of humanity, 
hearing that a fellow-creature has 
been cruelly and wantonly mur- 
dered, goes away satisfied, because 
he himself has sustained no loss by 
the murder ! There are, doubtless. 



many bright iexcepfidns to this re- 
mark in the West Indies, many men 
of enlightened minds, who would 
feel as deeply the horror of such a 
transaction as any individual in this 
country. But do we act unjustly 
when we unite with Lord Seaforth, 
himself also a planter, in applying 
the remark to the people — to the 
bulk of the community, whose pre- 
judices are stated by his Lordship 
to have been so horribly absurd as 
not merely to withstand any re- 
medy, but even to prevent inquiry; 
" for nothing," he says, " has 
given me more trouble than to get 
at the bottom of these businesses, 
so horribly absurd are the prejudices 

of THE PEOPLE !"

WEST-INDIAN SKETCHES, &c. 



In the Fourth Number of these 
Sketches will be found a short but 
awful summary of the case of the 
notorious Arthur Hodge. Extreme, 
and certainly not unnatural, is the 
resentment with which the publica- 
tion of this sad tal- seeius to have in- 
flamed the writer of the Antidote, 
It is " an arrogant and daring ca- 
lumny," " a disgusting falsehood," 
" an atrocious libel." Surely, 
exclaims this apologist, •' his ashes 
should rest in peace." " It little 
accords with true Christian charity, 
to pursue tb^ memory of tlie dead, 
even beyono the grave, with such 
unrelenting bitterness." 

We request our readers once 
more to peruse the history of this 
man's crimes. They will find that 
only eight years before his trial he 
was the owner of nearly 140 Ne- 
groes, of whom only 35 then re- 
mained ; — that in the deliberate 
judgment of Mr. Horsford, the 
Solicitor-General of the Leeward 
Islands, who appeals to the personal 
knowledge of the jury in confir- 
mation of his statement, one hun- 
dred of these unhappy beings had, 
in that short interval, fallen under 
the merciless tyranny of this mon- 
ster;— that, besides the more usual 
modes of plantation punishments, 
carried, indeed, to unusual excess, 
it was his habit to plunge the chil-« 
dren of his gang, of nine years of 
age, under water till they were 
stifled, and, before life was extin- 
guished, to order them to be sus- 
pended to a tree by their hands, 
and cartwhipped at close quarters, 
as he called it ; — that some were 
burnt with hot irons ; that he 
poured boiling water down the 
throats of others ; that, in one 
case, he dipped a child in a copper 
of boiling liquor; — that his crimes, 
in short, were such, both in their 
frequency aod atrocity, as not to 



be mentioned without horror. Our 
apologist, however, is anxious that 
those crimes should be forgotten, 
and that the memory of Arthur 
Hodge should be rescued from 
infamy. But is not the dread of 
this unceasing posthumous infamy, 
if it be not a guard of virtue, at 
least to be numbered among the 
preservatives from crime? The 
record of such awful transactions, 
although the most painful, is, in this 
view, not the least important pas- 
sage in the general history of human 
society. This is our general apo- 
logy for having dwelt upon a picture 
so disgusting. — Our particular ex- 
cuse is, that the story is pregnant 
with evidence of the degradation 
and wretchedness of West-Indian 
bondsmen. Not that we imagine, 
or would insinuate, that such beings 
as Hodge are often to be found 
even in that land of slavery ; or 
that we do not readily acknowledge 
that our colonies contain many 
proprietors whose humanity is at 
once unquestionable and admirable, 
and who, in circumstances pecu- 
liarly unfavourable, preserve un- 
injured the tenderness and bene- 
volence of their hearts. All this 
we freely admit, while we, never- 
tiieless, maintain our general po- 
sition. And certainly the history 
of Hodge's crimes seems to us to 
establish, beyond dispute, that the 
perpetration of such enormities 
without detection or punishment 
is easily practicable ; that, in the 
recesses of a plantation, where no 
free man hut the proprietor himself 
need be admitted, it is possible to 
rival, with perfect impunity, the 
crimes of a Caligula or a Nero ; that 
in such a sil'iation self interest it- 
self may be overborne by other pas- 
sions ; and that, even when Provi- 
dence at last exposes to the sight 
and execration of the world these 
N 2 



88 



hidden atrocities, the criminal may 
find among his fellow-colonists a 
jury to commend him to mercy, 
and a population disposed to rescue 
him from punishment. 

These conclusions, however, the 
Antidotist denies. The murderers 
of the families of Marr and William- 
son, he says, are still undiscovered : 
the impunity of Hodge is a pa- 
rallel case with the long security 
of these miscreants ; and the laws 
of England are no more culpable 
for the one than the laws of Tortola 
for the other. — What must that 
system be, which can drive its ad- 
vocates to such an apology as this ! 
To make the parallel complete, our 
apologist should have shewn that 
these families were murdered in 
the light of day, and in the sight 
and hearing of scores of men, 
women, and children, by a person 
in high station, who was known to 
every member of the community; 
that scarcely any man in Great 
Britain entertained a doubt of his 
guilt ; that his hands had for several 
years been bathed in blood ; that 
during those years no judicial in- 
quiry had been made into the facts 
of the case, no attempt made to ap- 
prehend the criminal, no reward 
offered for the discovery of his 
crimes ; that the murderer walked 
erect in society as a man <.f honour 
and a duellist, no man declining his 
company, and even ladies visiling 
him at his house, the scene of his 
enormities ; that he was a member 
of his Majesty's Privy Council, a 
Legislator, and a Judge, Let all 
this be shewn, and we will ad- 
mit the justice of the parallel. But 
if the fact be — as who will dispute 
it 1 — that the wretched murderer in 
England caused, on the first men- 
tion of his much lighter guilt, a cry 
of horror from every tongue; that 
the meanest labourer in this land 
would have shrunk from his touch 
as a contamination ; that ingenuity 
was fatigued in contriving plans 
for his detection; and that popular 
rage could hardly have been re- 
strained from destroying any one 



on whom suspicion appeared to 
rest : — if such was the effect of 
these murders in England ; and 
if crimes of a still deeper dye, 
when committed against Negroes, 
excited, in Tortola, for several 
years after they were committedj 
not one expression of public feeling, 
not one known effort for detection, 
ought not this writer to be ashamed 
of his comparison 1 Will he deny 
that the crimes of Hodge were 
well known in Tortola for several 
years before his trial was thought 
of? Hear the Antidotist's own 
witness, Mr. Horsford : — " The 
general character of the prisoner 
at the bar," says that gentleman, 
addressing the jury, " is well 
known to you all. Mr. Ptoss and 
Mr. Green inform you that eight 
years ago he was owner of near 
140 Negroes. How many, gentle* 
men, to your own knoivledge, has 
he now upon his esiate? That, 
coming within your own knowledge, 
is good proof. I am informed that 
there are not more than 35 remain- 
ing." (Trial, p. 1 38.) The finger of 
God, says the same advocate, has 
pointed out the son of this lady to 
be the avenger of her wrongs. "He 
is his first accuser. That ivhich was 
long known, hut remainedunnoticed 
and uninvestigated i'or want of proof 
to bring convictioii home to the mur- 
derer's door," (fee. (p. 137.) — Long 
known, and yet for want of proof 
uninvestigated!! — Hear again the 
Counsel for the prisoner ; — " Gm- 
tlemen who visited him must see 
Negroes in that state on an estate: 
you cannot therefore believe thfe 
witnesses." (p. 89.) And yet the 
jury did believe these witnesses, 
and the uncontradicted testimony 
of his ov.n advocate remains, that 
gentlemen visited this man at the 
scene of those horrors. But, 
stronger still to the same purpose, 
listen to the statement of the se- 
cond Counsel for the prosecution, 
already quoted by us in the Fourth 
Sketch, p. 38 : — " Why the wit- 
nesses, whom you will soon hear, did 
not earlier publish his guilt, you will 



89 



learn from themselves. Why he 
was not sooner arrested and brought 
to trial, you may as well individu- 
ally ask yourselves as any other 
person ; for you must each, as tvtU 
as the rest of the commnnlt}/, have 
learned from rumour the catalogue 
of his crimes. But ivhat is every 
hody's busifiess, usually is perform- 
ed by nobody; and not knowing 
where testimony might be procured, 
no individual would risk the chance 
of rendering himself the victim of 
Mr. Hodge's resentment and ven- 
geance, by making accusations he 
might not be able to substantiate as 
true : for you well know, gentle- 
men, that only on the evidence of 
free persons can a free person be 
convicted. Policy has decreed 
that Slaves shall only be permitled 
to testify against their fellow-slaves, 
and not agnhxst free persons, in any 
case ivhatsotver. Were it other- 
^'ise, I would here introduce a 
number of sable ivr etches, beariiig 
the ostensible marks of the pri- 
soner's cruelty, whose very appear^ 
ence would make humanity shud- 
der, and tchose tales of icoe would 
cause every nerve within yo?i to 
vibrate with agony." Trial, p. 54. 

Once more: look at the testimony 
of the tirst witness, Piobert Green. 
He says, " Mr. M'Keou£:h" (one of 
the witnesses for the Crown) " has 
been entertained at my house: he 
still eats and drinks with me, as 
does Perreene Georges" (another 
witness for the Crown), " both at 
my own charge." He was then 
asked, " Why were they placed 
with you?" His reply is; " Be- 
cause they both told the magi- 
strates, they wished to be put 
under my protection, as they were 
afraid of being assnssinaled, not 
hy Mr. J lodge, but by his friends." 
Trial, p. IG. 

The last witness to whotn we 
appeal is Mrs. Ann Arreiidell, ii 
lady, examined for the prisoner, 
*' Were you," she is asked, " a 
visitorat Mr. Hodge's?" " 1 was." 
** What is your opinion of Mr. 
Hodge?" " 1 can't say any Ihing 
but tvhat is pleasant of Mr. IJodijc, 



injustice to him, according to my 
conscience." pp.103, 105. 

In short, it is plain that this 
man, believed to be the murderer of 
many of his slaves, walked at large 
in Tortola, his crimes " uninvesti- 
gated," visited by " gentlemen," 
and by ladies too — a member of 
council, a legislator, and a judge ! 
And this is the state of society for 
which the Antidotist would find a pa- 
rallel in English laws and manners! 

He urges, however, that the 
Sketches suppressed many circum- 
stances tending to extenuate the 
conduct of this West-Indian so- 
ciety. In proof of this, he quotes, 
from the vt-ry passage in the speech 
of Mr. Lisle to which we have 
just referred, a declaration " that 
the magistrates had been indefa- 
tigable in bringing the prisoner to 
trial ;" and again, in Italics, that 
" nobody knew where testimony 
might be procured of his guilt." 

Now, first, let this railer feel the 
charge of suppression retorted on 
himself. If he really wished fairly 
to exhibit Mr. Lisle's testimony as 
to the activity of the police, why 
suppress those emphatic words 
which immediately precede his 
quotation ? " Why Mr. Hodge was 
not sooner arrested and brought to 
trial, you may as well individually 
ask yourselves as any other person; 
for you must each, as well as every 
other person in the community, 
have learnt from rumour the ca- 
talogue of his crimes." " But what 
is every body's business is usually 
performed by nobody." 

Such, then, when fairly given, is 
the testimony of Mr. Lisle on this 
subject. Whether our opponent 
will gain any thing by the produc- 
tion of it, our readers shall jmliie. 

The fact to be explained is this. 
At a plantation, situate within sight 
of the very seat of justice of Tor- 
tola, Hodge pursued his unparal- 
leled atrocities for I'uur long years; 
and this conduct, though long 
" known, remained unnoticed and 
uninvestigafed." This, we repeat, 
is the fiu't, resting on the statement 
of the gentlemen to whose testi- 



90 



laony our opponent himself ap- 
peals. Mr. Lisle seems to have 
felt that this fact might lead to in- 
ferences unfavourable to the hu- 
manity of the White population. 
He therefore advances two apolo- 
gies, of which the Antidotist, it 
seems, is desirous to have the be- 
nefit. 

First, then, Mr. Lisle states, that 
DO one knew where evidence was 
to be procured of Hodge's guilt. 
Compare with this Mr. Horsford's 
language: " I could here introduce 
a number of sable wretches, bear- 
ing the ostensible marks of the 
prisoner's cruelty, whose very ap- 
pearance would make humanity 
shudder, and cause every nerve 
within you to vibrate with agony!'' 
And yet, say these learned gentle, 
men, no one knew where testimony 
might be procured of his guilt, A 
valuable proof, doubtless, of the 
humanity of the West-[ndian code, 
and of the utility of the rule which 
rejects the evidence of slaves 1 
Now, if Hodge had resided in Eng- 
land, and had been the proprietor 
of a herd of cattle, whose carcasses 
were mangled by every description 
of torture the most atrocious and 
wanton, and if there had been no- 
torious circumstances sufficient to 
establish his guilt, we conceive 
there is no doubt, that on such cir- 
cumstantial evidence, he might have 
been convicted of a very high mis- 
demeanor. As little doubtful do 
we consider it to be, that although 
direct evidence against Hodge 
might have been wanting, there 
was circumstantial proof abund- 
antly sufficient to convict him of 
the crime of wilful murder. Who 
but himself could, upon his own 
estate, have been the perpetrator 
of such crimes? 

But this is not the only answer 
to Mr. Lisle's first apology. Why 
were not M'Keough, and Georges, 
and Skelton, and Green, by whose 
evidence the prisoner was at last 
convicted, much sooner examined 
on the subject] Why did not the 
gentlemen who, we are told, vi- 
sited at the estate, testify against 



the crimes of which tlie traces must 
have met their eyes 1 We trust, 
that in his next pamphlet, our op- 
ponent will answer these questions* 

But, secondly, Mr. Lisle asserts, 
that the magistrates were indefati- 
gable. In the same breath, we are 
told, that the magistrates were 
" indefatigable" and that the de- 
tection of these crimes was con- 
sidered as nobody's business* 
This is the important testimony 
we are accused of having sup- 
pressed. We did not choose, it 
seems, to let it be known that Mr. 
Lisle had, without comment, re- 
proof, or interruption, asserted, in 
the presence and hearing of the 
magistracy of the country, that 
" the whole community had learnt, 
from rumour, the catalogue of 
Hodge's crimes, but that what is 
every body's business is usually 
performed by nobody." Truly, 
we think, our opponent should 
not be displeased with such " sup- 
pressions" as these. 

But stiil Mr. Lisle asserts, that 
the magistrates have been indefa- 
tigable. We do not take upon our- 
selves at present to dispute, or even 
to consider, the truth of his asser- 
tion; but this much we hold to be 
indisputable, that no evidence of 
the reality of their labours has yet 
been produced. " Have been in- 
defatigable !" From what time 2 
Does Mr. Lisle assert that their 
exertions were coeval with the first 
suspicion of the crime? Does he 
allege that any attempt was made 
to interrupt the progress of this 
tragedy 1 This is the point to be 
proved. How the fact may really 
be, we are not now called upon to 
state. We simply assert, that if 
the printed copy of the trial to 
which our opponent refers, is ac- 
curate, Mr. Lisle does not prove 
the case in support of which the 
Antidotist cites his testimony. On 
the contrary, we think this gen- 
tleman's evidence, as there given, 
so decidedly hostile to the charac- 
ter of the magistrates, that if they 
Avere really innocent (which we do 
not mean either to assert or deny)

of the most scandalous neglect of 
duty, we can only express our as- 
touishment that they could permit 
this gentleman to make such de- 
clarations. He tells them to their 
face, that the prevention of these 
crimes liad been considered as no- 
body's business, and strangely sup- 
poses that he can atone for this 
insult, by simply asserting without 
dates or circumstances, that they 
had been indefatigable. He cer- 
tainly could not mean to speak of 
that period during which he tells 
them the whole matter was consi- 
dered to be nobody's business. 

But the legislature, it seems, 
was struck with horror, and paid 
600^ in support of the prosecution, 
besides taking other means to bring 
Mr. Hodge to justice. We wish 
they had also disclaimed all past 
knowledge or suspicion of the 
crimes of their colleague, and thus 
purged themselves from any share 
in that guilty indifference to his 
offences, with which the advocates 
for the Crown appear, by a direct 
inference, to have charged the po- 
pulation at large. The compli- 
mentary language of a Governor in 
a Public Order, or of a Minister 
of State in an Official Letter, are 
not a sufficient substitute for such 
a disavowal. 

But we are charged with falsely 
asserting that the militia were called 
out to prevent the White mob from 
rescuing Mr. Hodge from his fate. 
And how is this charge supported? 
By asserting, that this very White 
mob themselves constitute the mi- 
litia ; by quoting Governor El- 
liot's declaration that he was in 
consultation with the Council how 
to act in case of emergency ; by 
repeating that gentleman's testi- 
mony to their good conduct, and 
Lord Liverpool's approbation of 
the assistance given him by the 
legislature; and, lastly, by assert- 
ing that the militia were called out 
in order to keep the Black popula- 
tion in awe. 

To all this, the reply is easy, 
Evpii if it wore true lluit the While 
mob constituted the whole of llie 



military force of the island, we 
should say, that to embody them as 
a militia, and proclaim martial 
law, would have been the best 
mode of securing tranquillity, and 
preventing that jntevfeience with 
" the due execution of the fatal 
sentence of the law," which Go- 
vernor Elliot apprehended. fsJur- 
tia! law armed him with large and 
summary powers. It placed under 
the immediate eye of the Govern- 
ment, and under the restraints of 
military discipline, the very men 
whose insubordination, in other 
circumstances, it might be impos- 
sible with equal facility to prevent 
or to punish. The expediency, 
therefore, of this measure, even if 
it were true that the White popu- 
lation formed the whole of the 
militia, would be unquestionable. 

But it is not the fact that the 
militia consisted only of Whites. 
In Tortola, as in every other West- 
Indian island, a large proportion of 
the militia is composed of the free 
People of Colour, both Blacks and 
Mulattoes; .on whom, doubtless, 
during the existence of martial 
law, and the consequent suspen- 
sion of the ordinary forms of civil 
process, the Governor might con- 
fidently rely, on such an occasion, 
for the execution of his orders, and 
the maintenance of his authority. 
At least, they would prove a very 
formidable check on any tendency 
to insubordination which might have 
manifested itself among the White 
part of the embodied soldiery. 

But the Minister of Great Bri- 
tain joins with the Representative 
of his Majesty on the spot, in ap- 
proving the activity of those ma- 
gistrates. He did so, and the 
ground of applause was, that they 
had concurred to enforce the law 
against so heinous a criminal ! The 
sentiments of Governor Elliot, how- 
ever, are elsewhere clearly express- 
ed respecting the White population 
of the islan<ls comprised within the 
limits of his government. In a 
letter to Lortl Liverpool, dated An- 
tigua, 2lbt Nov. I BIO, and printed 
by order of the House of Commons 



32 



on the 31st May, 1811, he writes 
as follows : — 

" I dp not believe the defects 
complained of," namely, in the state 
of the colonial governments, "arc to 
be ascribed principally to the re- 
missness of their leading members. 
The root of the evil lies deeper. 
The fact is, the governments of the 
smaller islands were formed in times 
when many of the proprietors lived 
upon their estates, and the White 
population was, in some instances, 
perhaps ten times as numerous as 
it now is. Of the few White inha- 
bitants who remain, managers, over- 
seers, self created lawyers, self- 
educated physicians, and adven- 
turous merchants, with little real 
capital and scanty credit, compose 
the greatest part. The acquirements 
of education, among many of this 
description of persons, are very un- 
equal to the task of taking a share 
in the governments. The preva- 
lence of principle, either moral 
or religious, is also, I fear, not to 
be fairly calculated from the re- 
petition of the hackneyed expres- 
sions of which an ostentatious use 
is frequently made in addresses, 
and on all occasions meant to meet 
the public eye at home. 

" To collect from such a state 
of society, men fit to be legislators, 
judges, or jurymen, is perfectly 
impracticable. Individual interest, 
personal influence, animosity of 
party feuds, weigh down the scale 
of justice, and divert the course of 
legislative authority into acts of ar- 
bitrary and unjustifiable power, 
cloaked under the semblance and 
dignified with the name of consti- 
tutional acts. How such defects 
are to be remedied, is a question 
which requires much minute inves- 
tigation and serious and dispassion- 
ate consideration." 

Now it is for agreeing with Mr. 
Elliot, as to the necessity of some 
remedial measures to obviate these 
defects, that we are reviled by our 
Antidotist. 

But this writer tells us, and with 



an air of seriousness, that the dan- 
ger apprehended by Governor El- 
liot was from the Black popula- 
tion ! That is to say, they whose 
wrongs were to be avenged, whose 
persons were to acquire from the 
execution of this righteous sentence 
a new defence from the most cruel 
injuries: they it was, we are re- 
quired to believe, who, at the risk 
of the severest punishment, were to 
bear Mr. Hodge from his fate, and 
to dash from his lips by violence 
the bitter cup he was sentenced to 
taste. This Antidotist is but a 
shallow student of human nature. 
He ought to have employed his 
dialectic skill in reconciling his ex- 
traordinary view of this case with 
the distinct assertion of Governor 
Elliot, that the measures to which 
he was obliged to have recourse for 
preserving the public tranquillity, 
and ensuring the due execution of 
Hodge's sentence, were rendered 
necessary by the state of "party 
animosity" in the island. Is it 
possible to conceive a case of more 
gross and wilful misrepresentation 
tlian is here attempted? 

Let, then, this writer rail on, and 
call in aid his colleagues to supply 
him with terms to blacken the cha- 
racter and defame the motives of 
his opponents. We hesitate not to 
assert again, that this story of 
Hodge's murders carries with it a 
whole body of argument,destructive 
of all the sophisms and falsehoods 
of this apologist, and for which 
he will never find an effectual 
" antidote." It not only convicts 
the wretched being of the crimes 
for which he died, but demonstrates 
the cold insensibility to the suffer- 
ings of Negroes, the difficulty of 
punishing crimes against them, the 
dreadful powers of masters, the 
strength of the temptations to 
abuse those powers, and the help- 
less, degraded, despised condition 
of slaves, even in English West-In- 
dian settlements, with a force which 
no subtlety can evade, and no vio- 
lence subdue.
