minutes. The next three columns show the time of the moon's rising 
and setting at the places mentioned. The 12th column shows the 
difference between mean or true time, as it .would be exhibited by a 
perfect clock, and apparent time, as it is indicated by the sun. The 
13th column shows the time of high water in Boston. To find it at 
other places, add to the time given in the Calendar pages, or subtract 
from it, according to the following

TO THE PUBLIC. 

As a reason for issuing a new Almanac for 1836, 1 would merely call 
j our attention to the fact that SLAVERY exists in the United States. 
While it continues, I shall deem it an imperative duty to lift up my 
oice in behalf of the master and the slave. My love for the master 
impels me to expostulate with him, and to warn him of the perils 
which surround the path in which he is walking. When 1 hear the 
slave groaning beneath the lash, humanity will not permit me to turn 
a deaf ear to his cry. But many are ready to ask, What right have 

e at the north to meddle with slavery ? I will not stop to show 
that we have a right to plead the cause of those who are appointed to 
destruction; — I will merely allude to a few considerations which 
prove that we are under solemn obligations so to do. 

1. Slavery is exerting a corrupting influence upon us: it is our 
duty to counteract this influence. 

2. We have in various ways contributed to uphold and extend sla- 
very at the south. [See Calendar page for March.] It is our duty to 
endeavor to atone for our fault in this respect. 

3. We are acting as partners to slave-holders, by restoring their fu- 
gitive slaves. 

4. We have promised to assist the master in sustaining his arthority, 
by furnishing military force, when needed, to put down insurrection. 

5. We are setting the slave-holders an example of oppression,- by 
continuing slavery in the District of Columbia, and the territories. 

G. We are rewarding slave-holders for their usurpation and injus- 
tice, by allowing them to send 25 Representatives to Congress, to 
represent their slave property. 

In preparing this work, I have acted independently of any man or 
body of men, and no one but myself is committed, by anything here 
published. It has been my chief object to condense as many valuable 
ideas within the prescribed limits a6 a proper regard to perspicuity 
would allow- It is rather a collection of texts than a series of essays. 
[ am aware that some readers wish to be entirely relieved of the labor j 
of thinking for themselves. This work is not prepared for such. It 
is designed to suggest matter for thought and reflection. In many ! 
cases, a thought expressed in a single sentence might furnish matter | 
for several pages of useful comments. I ask the reader to scrutinize 
closely, and reflect candidly upon the various topics here presented, 
and if any farther information is desired, the list of books at the end ■ 
will direct you where to find it. 

In giving facts, anecdotes, &c, illustrative of slavery, I have care- ' 
fully avoided those accounts of unusual cruelty and atrocity which 
have come to my knowledge ; but have chosen those which show the 
common and ordinary operations of the system. 

The extracts from the debate in the Virginia Legislature speak i 
volumes. They are worthy of an attentive perusal by every northern 
opponent of abolition. 

I have made free use of the many valuable works on slavery within 
my reach, and it has been almost impossible to give credit for every j 
sentence and part of sentence so used. I here acknowledge my ob- 1 
ligations to ail those from whose writings I have derived assistance, j 

Most of the matter has been prepared, while I have been^ laboring ! 
under bodily indisposition, and while many othet-objects have required ! 
my constant attention. The readers of the Almanac will receive this 
as an apology for its imperfections. ' NATH'L SOUTHARD. 



JANUARY begins on FRIDAY. [1836 



1, 1831. First number of the Liberator published in Boston. 

14, 1835. American Union for the relief and improvement of the 
colored race, organized in Boston. 

25, 1835. William Turpin died in New York, aged 80. He was a 
native of Rhode Island, but removed to Charleston, S. C. He 
early became convinced of the sinfulness of slavery. Many slaves 
were emancipated by his exertions, and provided with comfortable 
means of support. He was instrumental in releasing from prison 
29 free colored persons, who would have been sold by the laws of 
South Carolina, but for his exertions. He was a member of the 
Society of Friends, and very wealthy. At his death he made liberal 
bequests to those who had formerly been his slaves ; and gave $20,000 
to be applied to the benefit of free people of color. 

30, 1832. The New England Anti-Slavery Society formed at Boston. 
This was the first Society of the kind which was formed in the 
United States. It is now called the Massachusetts A. S. Society. 



"I WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR." 

This kind expression will come from many a happy heart, and be 
accompanied by many a token of love at the beginning of 1836. 
Parents and children, brothers and sisters, neighbors and schoolmates, 
relatives and friends, will thus express their mutual regard. But who 
wishes a happy new year to the slave, whose years are spent in toil 
and hardship for which he has no reward, and who is constantly liable 
to injury for which he has no redress ? Reader, do you wish a happy 
new year to him ? have you prepared for him a new year's present ? 
Can you not find some means to show your sympathy, by doing 
something in his behalf? Pity the slave, whose new year is a new 
link added to his chain of wretchedness. 

Do you wish a happy new year to the master ? Can you make the 
year happy to him who is constantly alarmed lest sudden destruc- 
tion should overtake him ? " The number of years is hidden to the 
oppressor. A dreadful sound, (or as in the margin, a sound of fears,) 
is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him." 
Job 15 : 20, 21. A clergyman once stated in Boston that he had cor- 
respondents in Alabama, who informed him that they were in a state 
of constant alarm : that they did not dare to go to bed at night, with- 
out one of their number kept awake to keep watch, lest there should 
be an insurrection of the slaves. Many slave-holders are in the con- 
stant habit of sleeping with pistols at their bedside ; and in some 
cases, it is said, they take the young children of their slaves to sleep 
in their own rooms, that the slaves may be prevented from attacking 
them for fear of hurting their own children. Does not this show 
that they have a sound of f ems in their ears? Neither the slaves nor 
masters, (speaking generally,) can have a happy new year while sla- 
very continues.

FEBRUARY begins on MONDAY. [1836 



2, 1635. Mr. Dickson made a noble and fearless speech in Congress, 

in favor of the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. 
13, 1833. Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, (brother of Stanislaus 

Augustus, the last king of Poland,) died at Florence, aged 78. 

He rendered himself illustrious, by being the first to emancipate his 

serfs throughout his extensive estates. 



DISCUSSION AT LANE SEMINARY. 

In Feb. 1834, the subjects of slavery and colonization were discus- 
sed, (each 9 evenings,) by the students in Lane Seminary, Ohio. 
The question of immediate emancipation was decided in the affirma- 
tive, without a dissenting vote; The question, " Are the doctrines, 
tendencies and -measures of the American Colonization Society, and the 
influence of its principal supporters, such as render it worthy of the 
patronage of the Christian public ? " was decided in the negative with 
only one dissenting voice. We give the following extracts from the 
letter of H. B. Stanton, w 7 ho was then a student in the Seminary. 

"We are situated within one mile of a slave-holding state ; eleven of 
our number were born and brought up in slave states, seven of whom 
were sons of slave-holders, and one of them was himself a slave-hold- 
er, till recently j one of us had been a slave and had bought his freedom 
' with a great sum,' which his own hands had earned; ten others had 
lived more or less in slave slates, besides several who had traveled 
in the midst of slavery, making inquries and searching after truth." 

[Is it possible to find a body of men who would be better authority ?] 

"From their testimony, the following facts and premises were es- 
tablished, to wit : That slaves long for freedom ; that it is a subject of 
very frequent conversation among them ; that they know their mas- 
ters have no right to hold them in slavery ; that they keenly feel the 
wrong, the insult and the degradation which are heaped upon them 
by the w T hites ; they feel no interest comparatively in their master's 
affairs, because they know he is their oppressor ; they are indolent, 
because nothing they can earn is their own ; they pretend to be more 
ignorant and stupid than they really are, so as to avoid responsibility, 
and to shun the lash for any real or alleged disobedience to orders ; 
when inspired with a promise of freedom, they will toil with incred- 
ible alacrit}' and faithfulness ; they tell their masters and drivers they 
are contented with their lot, merely through fear of greater cruelty if 
they tell the truth ; no matter how kind their master is, they are dis- 
satisfied, and would rather be his hired servants than his slaves ; the 
slave-drivers are generally low, brutal, debauched men, distinguished 
only for their cruelty and licentiousness \ they generally have the des- 
potic control of the slaves ; the best side of slavery is seen by visiters ; 
its darker features being known only to slaves, masters and drivers ; 
[upon this point, horrid facts, in regard to the whipping- and murder- 
ing of slaves, were developed.] The influence of slavery upon the 
physical condition, and mental and moral character of the whites, is 
decidedly and lamentably pernicious ; the internal slave-trade is in- 
creasing, and is carried on by men distinguished, even among slave- 
drivers, for their cruelty and brutality ! Masters are generally opposed 
to their negroes being educated. The blacks are abundantly able to 
take care of, and provide for themselves ; and that they would be 
kind and docile if immediately emancipated." 



1836.] 



FEBRUARY — SECOND MONTH. [29 days. 



James Bradley, one of the students in Lane Seminar) 7 , was formerly 
a slave in Arkansas. When he was about 18, his master died, and for 
several years he managed the plantation for his mistress. In 5 years, 
he obtained, by labor and* trading, $655, besides supporting himself. 
He paid $055 for his freedom, and then went to L. Sem. He said the 
great desire of the slaves was ''LIBERTY & EDUCATION," and 
shall this heaven-born desire be trampled in the dust?

ADDRESS TO THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. 

Gentlemen : — 

An awful responsibility rests upon you, in regard to the enslave- 
ment and degradation of the colored population of these United States. 
Their destiny is now in your hands. Therefore as you deal with 
them, so will God, in his providence, deal with the nation, which you 
represent. Great as may be our freedom, we cannot be independent 
of the Almighty. Unless our rulers execute justice, ruin will befall 
us. The sin of oppression is peculiarly offensive to the merciful 
God; and whenever persisted in, has, under his moral government, 
brought destruction upon nations, no less than individuals. A glance 
at history will bring to your view illustrations of this appalling fact. 
And surely there have been already admonitions, which no intelli- 
gent mind can misunderstand, that his righteous displeasure is even 
now enkindled against this guilty nation. Why should we be stricken 
any more ? 

Gentlemen, when we say the destiny of our enslaved countrymen 
is in your hands, think not we mistake the nature and extent of your 
powers. We are aware, you cannot, by any act of legislation, direct- 
ly liberate those who are held in bondage, under any of the State 
Governments. But you may hasten their deliverance by letting 
those go free, who are at your disposal. Slavery, with all its concom- 
itant cruelties, is enforced upon more than 26,000 immortal beings, in 
the District of Columbia, the Arkansas and Floridas, which are known 
to be under your exclusive jurisdiction. These are suppliants at your 
feet. They plead for justice, for mercy, for their inalienable rights. 
Let them not cry in vain. Take them by the hand. R,aise them from 
the condition of brutes. Bid them be men. And what you do will 
be seen by all. What you say will go out into all our borders 
Should you abolish slavery in the District of Columbia alone, it 
would heave the foundations of the system in every State of the Union. 

So long as our national government continues to uphold slavery — 
especially so long as our legislators refrain from considering its sin- 
fulness and its danger, so long will those who are guilty of this flagrant 
violation of the rights of man, and the laws of God.be at ease. Con- 
gress is the sun — the central body, from which light radiates to every 
part of our political system. The eyes of the nation are upon you. 
Their ears are open to every report that comes from you. How great 
then is your responsibility ! Let it be seen, we conjure you, let it be 
seen, that you act in the fear of God, and with a just regard for the 
rights of man. 

N. B. At the last session of Congress, there were, in the House of 
Representatives, 140 members from the non-slave-holding, and 99 from 
the slave-holding states. Yet a motion to refer the petitions for the 
abolition of slavery in the Dist. of Columbia to a special Committe, and 
thereby ensure the discussion of ike subject in the House, was lost. All 
the Reps, from the slave states, (except the one from Del.) voted against 
the motion , and only 76 of those from th e free states voted in favor of it. 



1836.] MARCH— THIRD MONTH. [31 days. 


In the month of March, 1820, the bill for the admission of Mis- 
souri into the Union as a slave-holding state was acted upon in Con- 
gress. All the Reps, from the slave states, and 14 from the free states, 
voted in favor of the measure. Any two of them might have pre-; 
vented this withering curse from bein^ fastened upon that great state.

10 APRIL begins on FRIDAY. [1836 



FAST-DAY. 

During this month, a day is usually set apart for fasting and prayer, 
in many parts of the United States. There cannot be a more appro- 
priate time to consider our national sin, than on this day of humilia- 
tion. It is hoped that every clergyman will be ready on this day, to 
" cry aloud, and show the people their transgressions," in reference 
to slavery, as well as other great national sins. When we think of 
God's severe threatenings against those who " have dealt by oppres- 
sion with the stranger," we have reason to humble ourselves, and 
cry mightily to God. Let us follow the example of the Ninevites, 
and " turn every man from his evil way, and from the violence that is 
in our hands. Who can tell if God will turn away from his fierce 
anger, that we perish not ? " Let us observe the fast that God has 
chosen, (Is. 58 : 6.) and put away from the midst of us the yoke, the 
putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; and we may expect 
the fulfillment of the promise; " Then shall thy light rise in obscu- 
rity, and thy darkness be as the noon-day. And the Lord shall guide 
thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy 
bones." 

EFFECTS OF SLAVERY UPON THE CHURCH. 

What are the benefits that slavery has conferred upon the church, 
in return for its Christian baptism, and its hearty welcome to 
the communion of the saints? It builds anew and sanctifies the 
heathen barrier of caste, and while her prayers and her alms tra- 
verse oceans to find heathen in the ends of the earth, it shuts up her 
bowels against the heathen at her own door, and of her own creation ; 
and, as if to make the church the derision of scoffers, it grants her 
special indulgence to make heathen at home for her own benefit, pro- 
vided, by way of penance, she contributes a tithe of the profit for the 
conversion of heathen abroad. — Ohio Declaration. 

PERSECUTION. 

There are many who wonder that a cause, which is so evidently the 
cause of God, should meet with such fierce and bitter opposition; and 
there is danger that abolitionists may become disheartened, in view 
of it. To such I would say, " Count it not strange concerning the 
fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened 
unto you." — 1 Pet. 4:12. I believe we shall search in vain for the 
history of any important reformation, which was ever accomplished 
without encountering difficulties and obstacles; and we have no 
reason to believe that we shall be able to strangle the giant, slavery, 
without a long and severe struggle. It is important, therefore, that 
we should be early inured to hardship and reproach, that our stead- 
fastness may be tried, and that we may become hardened against 
every attack, or in other words, fire-proof. The reproach we endure 
prevents half-hearted time-servers from coming into our ranks. 

The farmer does not mourn when he sees the April storm beating 
upon the tender blade which is just springing up. He knows that it will 
cause it to strike its root deeper, and to cling more closely to the soil 
which sustains it. So it should be with us. When the storms of 
persecution beat upon us, it should cause us to plant ourselves more 
j firmly upon the truths of God's word, and to cling more closely to 
our Master and Leader. 



1836.] 



APRIL — FOURTH MONTH. 



[30 days. 



It is supposed that not less than 50,001) visitors from the slave-hold- 
ng states visit the north every year. Let them come in contact with 
a people zealously and understandingly opposed to slavery ; let them 
hear the united voice of a whole community, proclaiming to them the 
guilt and danger of oppression, and many of them will go home and 
loose the bands of wickedness,' and persuade others to do likewise.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY. 

At its annual meeting, May 12, 1835, the following officers were 
chosen. 

President, Arthur Tappan ; Treasurer, John Rankin ; Sec'y for 
Foreign Correspondence, Hon. William Jay; Sec' y for Dom. Cor. 
Elizur Wright, Jr.; Recording Secretary, Abraham L. Cox, M. D. 

Executive Committee. Arthur Tappan, John Rankin, Lewis Tappan, 
Joshua Leayitt, Samuel E. Cornish, William Goodell, Abraham L. 
Cox, Theodore S. Wright, Simeon S. Jocelyn, Elizur Wright, Jr. 

This committee is distinguished for faithfulness and efficiency. All 
friends of the cause should give liberally to sustain its operations. 

The following were among the Resolutions passed at the meeting. 

Resolved, That this Society recommend that all its auxiliaries, so 
far as convenient, hold public meetings on the 4th of July throughout 
the country, and take collections in aid of its funds. 

Resolved, That this Society earnestly request that ladies, in every 
section of the land, organize themselves into Anti-slavery societies, 
and sewing or other associations for the purpose of co-operating with 
it in the great work of emancipation ; and that those ladies who have 
already done this, have the warmest thanks of the members of the 
parent institution, for the prompt and efficient co-operation they have 
rendered. 

Resolved, That this Society rejoices in the formation and co-opera- 
tion of juvenile anti-slavery societies and associations, and does earn- 
estly desire that children in all parts of the country may be encouraged 
to form themselves into similar societies, that children who are free 
may thus aid in emancipating the children of this land who are now 
slaves. 

Resolved, That this Society regards with approbation and gratitude 
the formation of young men's anti-slavery societies, and earnestly 
hopes that young men throughout the country will embody themselves 
in similar associations, and give to the cause of emancipation the in- 
fluence and vigor of their youthful energies. 

Resolved, That the laws and practices of the slave-holding States, 
which forbid our free colored citizens travelling through their borders 
or settling on their soil, under the pains and penalties of fine or im- 
prisonment, are anti-republican, cruel and unconstitutional, and a 
bold infringement upon state rights, demanding strong expostulation 
and indignant remonstrance on the part of the poople of the free states. 

For an account of the publications of the Society, see page 47.

1 4 JUNE begins on WEDNESDAY [1836 



4, 1829. Resolutions introduced into the British House of Commons 
declaring slavery in the British colonies unlawful. Not carried 

10, 1806. Act to abolish the slave-trade passed the British Parliament 
In the House of Commons, the vote stood 114 to 15 ; in the House 
of Lords, 100 to 36. The measure was first introduced in Parlia- 
ment, May 9, 1788. 

27, 1833. Miss Crandall imprisoned in Brooklyn Ct. on the charge of 
having taught persons of color from out of the state. 



TO THE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR. 

We are engaged in a work of great difficulty, toil and sacrifice, and i 
we ask you to assist us. It is this :— to remove every external obsta- 
cle in the way of the upward and onward progress, in virtue, respect- i 
ability and happiness, of every colored inhabitant of the United States ! 
We wish to have every avenue leading to true happiness, opened as j 
widely to you as to persons of a different complexion. It is in your! 
power, by your good conduct, to put your shoulders to the wheel, and 
roll forward the car of abolition; or you may, by your vices, place' 
obstructions in the way, and hold it back in its progress. Which do ! 
you choose to do ? There is not one of you who can say, ' I have j 
nothing to do in this matter.' You are, each one of you, doino- much ! 
either to help forward or to hinder the work in vvhich we°are en- J 
gaged. We have not room to enlarge. We offer the following brief! 
suggestions, and entreat of you to < think of these things.' Let every I 
colored boy and girl who can, get them by heart. 

1. I must be industrious. I have much to do, and have need to be 
always employed. 

2. I must be economical. There are so man}' good uses to which; 
money can be applied, that not a -cent should be~wasted. 

3. I must improve my time. ' Part with no moment but in purchase 
of its worth.' Time is too precious to be thrown away. 

4. I must be temperate in all things. Intemperance is a worse enemy ! 
than slavery. I will give it no quarter. 

5. I must improve, my mind. If I am ignorant, I shall be constantly 
liable to be imposed upon. God has given me a mind, and the means 
of improvement, and it is my duty to use them. 

6. / must l Search the Scriptures.' They are the fountain of wisdom. j 

7. J must ' live peaceably with all ' around me. We can never be ! 
prosperous or happy, if we quarrel with one another. 

8 I must use no profane language. It is very wicked, & does no good, j 

9. Parents must be very careful to teach their children good morals! 
and useful knowledge. [ The Sabbath School will afford you much aid.'] 

10. Children must obey their parents, — promptly and cheerfully. 

1 God helps them that help themselves.' If you wish for assistance j, 
from others, make a good use of the privileges you now enjoy. By 
obserring the foregoing suggestions, you will make yourself a blessing I 
to society, you will strengthen the hands and encourage the hearts of 1 
your friends, and fill their mouths with arguments ; you will leave an F 
invaluable legacy to your children, and put to shame the malice of \ 
your enemies. By pursuing a contrary course, you will prove a curse j 
to yourself and your race, you will pierce with anguish the hearts of j 
your friends, give your enemies cause of triumph, spread gloom and • 
darkness over the prospects of the slave, and leave an inheritance of j 
shame toy our children, who will visit your grave to curse your memory. [ 



1836] JUNE — SIXTH MONTH. 


[30 days. 




The convention of free people of color will assemble on the sixth 
of tiiis month in the city of Philadelphia May they forget all local 
prejudice and personal animosity, and join hand in hand in the great 
work of self-improvement. The signs of the times clearly show that 
they who have been so long " meted out and trodden down," are soon 
[to rise " from the dust." They may do much to hasten the event.

16 JULY begins on FRIDAY. [1836 



4. 1776. Declaration of American Independence. 

7, 1809. St. Domingo surrendered to the British. 
; 13, 1833. Great Anti-Colonization meeting at Exeter Hall, London. 

15, 1834. Date of James G. Birney's Letter to Thornton J. Mills, 
I giving his reasons for withdrawing from the Colonization Society. 

28, 1833. Wilberforce died, a ff ed 74. 



The corner-stone upon which our fathers founded the Temple of 
i Freedom was broadly this — ' that all men are created equal; that 
] they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; 
that among these are life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.' 
j At the sound of their trumpet-call, three millions of people rose up 
'as from the sleep of death, and rushed to the strife nf blood ; deeming 
it more glorious to die instantly as freemen, than desirable to live one 
hour as slaves. — They were few in number — poor in resources ; but 
the honest conviction that Tkuth, Justice and Right were on their 
side, made them invincible. 

While one sixth part of the inhabitants of the land are held as arti- 
cles of merchandise, can we call the work of our fathers complete ? 

:i The Masters treat their slaves as kindly as they treat their children! " 
A sea captain relates, that while stopping at a southern port, he 
boarded at a house where there were several daughters; one of whom, 
while he was there, met with an accident, by which she lost two of 
her front teeth. A mulatto female slave was immediately called in, 
and two of her teeth were drawn out, and inserted in their stead. 

HOW PARENTS DO TREAT THEIR CHILDREN. 

The following was related by an apologist for slavery. 

While stopping in a town of considerable note, in the interior of 

Virginia, he was awakened, one Sabbath morning, by loud screaming in 

the street. He ran out, as soon as possible, to ascertain the cause. 

He found that the screaming came from a cart in which were confined 
j a mulatto woman, and four children, nearly ichite. A slave-dealer was 

taking them through the village, in this manner, on his way to the 
i south. The gentleman inquired into their history, and learned that 
{ the woman had lived for several years, in the family of a gentleman 
: in that neigborhood, as his house-keeper. She was the mother of 
! the children, and it was generally supposed, by all who resided in the 
! vicinity, that the gentleman with whom she lived, was their father. 
j He was then in Washington, and had written to his overseer, a few 
I days before, directing him to sell the woman and her children to some 
| slave-dealer, who would carry them where he should never hear from 
I them again; — assigning it as his reason that he had made arrange- 
! ments to bring a wife home with him, and he feared, that, if the wo- 
J man and her children were allowed to remain, it would occasion trouble. 
• The despotism which our fathers could not bear in. their native 

!| country is expiring, and the sword of justice in her reformed hands 
j has applied its exterminating edge to slavery. Shall the United States 
I — the free United States, which could not bear the bonds of a king, 
[l cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing? Shall a Republic 
be less free than a°Monarchy ? Shall we, in the vigor and buoyancy 
of our manhood, be less energetic in righteousness, than a kingdom 
in its age ? ' — Dr. Fallen's Address. 



1836,] JULY — SEVENTH MONTH. [31 days. | 


The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbe- 
ry, and have vexed the poor and needy ; yea, they have oppessed the 
stranger wrongfully. — Fzek. 22 : 29. Ye have not hearkened unto 
!me, in proclaiming liberty : — behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith 
jthe Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, &to the famine. — Jer. 34 : 17.

18 AUGUST begins on MONDAY. [1836 



1, 1834. Emancipation of all the slaves in the British Colonies. 

3, 1492. Columbus first sailed for America. 

5. 1826. A decree issued by the Austrian Gov't, That every slave 

who should set foot on Austrian soil, or even on the deck of an Aus- 

train vessel, should become free. 
24, 1759. Wilberforee born. 26, 1832. Adam Clarke died, aged 72. 



THE FIRST OF AUGUST. 
This is a day on which the friends of universal liberty should re 
joice; and to which they may refer, as a day when the seal of false- 
hood was set upon the absurd predictions of slave-holders and their 
apologists, that rebellion, conflagration and murder would attend the 
liberation of the negro. In most of the islands, emancipation was 
rather nominal than real ; — the whip was taken out of the master's 
hand, and lodged in the hands of a magistrate, while no motive to 
labor was offered to the slave, whom they then registered as an ap- 
prentice. Under these circumstances, "they exhibited a meekness, 
patience, and forbearance; utterly without a parallel. Not one life 
has yet been taken, not one d welling fired , throughout the Bi itish West 
Indies, by the emancipated slaves." In Jamaica, there were 331,000 
slaves, and only 37,000 whites. If there should be no evils resulting 
from the apprenticeship system, we shall be compelled to believe that 
the blacks are prodigies of mildness and forbearance. 

In the islands of Bermuda and Antigua which adopted the plan of 
immediate and unconditional emancipation, (for advocating which we 
are called fanatic& and madmen,) the highest hopes of the negroes' 
friends were fulfilled. Bermuda contained 5,500 whites, and 4,650 
slaves; — Antigua, 2,000 whites, and 30,000 slaves. 

The Bermuda Gazette of Aug. 4, says, " Four days of universal 
freedom have now passed, and four days of more perfect regularity 
and quiet have these famed peaceful islands never witnessed." 

The Hon. Mr. Butterfield, Chief Justice of Bermuda, in his charge 
to the grand jury on the 6th of November, observed ; " It is a subject 
of congratulation, and certainly of commendation to the emancipated 
that in three months the general character and comfort of society has 
improved, and that the evils which some of its best friends apprehend- 
ed, were inall cases overrated, and in some have had no existence 

But there the whites were equal in number to the blacks; — let us 
see what were the " consequences " of emancipation, where there 
were 15 blacks to one white. 

An Antigua paper of Aug. 7, says, " A whole people, comprising 
30,000 souls, have passed from slavery into freedom, not only without 
the slightest irregularity, but with the solemn and decorous tranquil- 
lity of the Christian Sabbath " The same paper of Aug. 21, say3, 
" Not the least symptom of insubordination has manifested itself 
anywhere ; and the daily accounts from all quarters testify to the ex- 
cellent disposition and conduct of the new freemen." 

" It had been customary in this island, as an additional security 
against insurrection, to proclaim martial law at the Christmas holy- 
days, during which time the slaves had peculiar opportunities for 
forming conspiracies. The great act of justice accomplished on the 
first of August, relieved the planters of all apprehension of insurrec- 
tion ; and not only was the usual proclamation withheld at the last 
Christmas, but the militia was exempted from duty. " — Jay's Inquiry, 



1836] AUGUST — EIGHTH MONTH. 


[31 days. 


Let the oppressed go free, break every yoke. — Then shall thy light 
break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily. 
And thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, 
whose waters jail not. And they that shall be of thee shall build the old 
waste plates ; and thou shall be called the Repairer of the breach. Is. 58.

PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR. 
Mark how a plain tale shall put you down. Shakspeare. 

It is a singular fact that those who profb-ss belief in a strong, instinc- 
tive, insurmountable prejudice against color, are the very ones who 
are most alarmed about amalgamation by intermarriage. As if the 
two propositions did not obviously destroy each other ! 

At a town meeting in New Hampshiie the question was discussed 
whether colored people ought to be admitted into schools upon equal 
terms with white scholars. One individual arose and treated the sub- 
ject after the usual manner of those who have thought little about it. 
" If we cultivate these people," said he, " the first thing we shall know 
they will be marrying our daughters. Such a thing as a kind social 
relation between the two races was never intended by Providence. 
The colored people are naturally inferior, and cannot be elevated. 
! It is impossible for us to exist together in the same community with 
them, on equal terms ; you might as well try to mix oil and water.'' 

Upon this, a plain farmer remarked, " Why I thought you said just 
now that the first thing we should know they would be marrying our 
darters. If they wont mix any better than ile and water, what are 
you afraid on ? " 

At the same meeting, in the same place, a person observed that he 
had no objection to colored people's being educated ; but they might 
get up schools for themselves ; it was his opinion that white folks had 
better let the niggers alone. An elderly man arose, and asked the 
i following pithy question : "When the angel of the Lord commanded 
Philip to enter the chariot of the Ethiopian and explain to him the 
Scriptures, what if Phillip had answered, ' I think, Lord, it is best for 
white people to let these niggers alone ? ' " 

Let the long evenings be well improved. Hold public meetings 
and discussions often. In cities, let there be a course of familiar lec- 
tures on useful topics for people of color.

22 OCTOBER begins on SATURDAY. [1836 



I, 1807. First steamboat passed from New York to Albany. 

3, 1833. Riots at New York. Garrison returned from England. 

II, 1492. Columbus discovered Bahama. 

18, 1831. The bill abolishing the hereditary rights of the French 

peerage passed in the Chamber of Deputies. 
25, 1682. Philadelphia settled. 
30, 1831. Nat Turner, the ringleader of the slave insurrection in 

Southampton Co. Va. taken. Executed Nov. 11th, 1831. 

FREE LABOR AND SLAVE LABOR 

While the farmers of the north are gathering in their golden har- 
vests, the laborer who has borne the heat of summer in cultivating 
the soil, rejoices in the expectaiion of being rewarded for his labor. 
He and his employer have mutual interests, and they will strive to 
promote each other's welfare. Where slavery prevails, it is not so. 
The system is as much at war with economy as it is with justice. 

" The slave is bought, sometimes at a very high price ; in free labor 
there is no such investment of capital. The slave does not care how 
slowly or carelessly he works; it is the free man's interest to do his 
business well and quickly. The slave is indifferent how many tools 
he spoils ; the free man has a motive to be careful. The slave's cloth- 
ing is indeed very cheap, but it is of no consequence to him how fast 
it is destroyed — his master must keep him covered, and that is all he 
is likely to do ; the hired laborer pays more for his garments, but 
makes them last three times as long. The free man will be honest 
for reputation's sake; but reputation will make the slave none the 
richer, nor invest him with any of the privileges of a human being — 
while his poverty and sense of wrong both urge him to steal from his 
master. A salary must be paid to an overseer to compel the slave to 
work; the free man is impelled by the desire of increasing the com- 
forts of himself and family." ^-M rs. Child. 

?' Wherever the option exists to employ, at an equal hire, free or 
sla^e labor, the former will be decidedly preferred. It is more capable, 
more diligent, more faithful, and in every respect more worthy of 
confidence. 

" It is believed that nowhere in the farming portion of the United 
States would slave labor be generally employed, if the proprietor were 
not tempted to raise slaves by the high price of the Southern market, 
which keeps it up in his own.'' — Henry Clay. 

" The labor of a West India slave costs about thrice as much as it 
would cost if executed by a free man." — Dr, James Anderson. 

A West India planter found by experiment that 6 slaves stimulated 
by the offer of a premium did more work in the same time than 18 
who were driven by the lash. — Adam Hodgson's Letter to J. B. Say. 

" In passing from a free into a slave-state, the change is instantly 
! visible, even to the most careless eye, and nature herself seems to 
droop and sicken under the withering influence of slavery." 

The mind of a slave, while a slave, is like a watch without its main- 
! spring. You may take hold of its hands by direct physical force and 
move theni around, but you cannot make them go alone. The self- 
i moving power is gone. But make that slave a freeman, restore his 
long-lost but inalienable rights, and by that single act, you have put 
I the main-spring back again. — Phelps.

Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall

SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 

[Extract from a Traveler's Journal^] 

lebruary, 1835. Visited the Slave-Trader's Prison at Alexandria, 
where a brisk business is carried on by Franklin & Armfield, in pur- 
chasing men, women and children, and shipping them to the far 
South. They are bought without regard to parental ties, and chil- 
dren are often torn from their parents by unprincipled agents, employ- 
ed for the purpose, who collect them as our country drovers collect 
horses, cattle, sheep, or swine, and often march them through the en- 
closure of the capitol, in droves, chained together. This was done 
during the last session of Congress. Many are committed to jail, 
and sold into slavery for life, to pay their jail fees. I found in the 
prison, under the dwelling of F. & A., about seventy men and boys, 
some of whom had heavy chains upon them, — and I was informed, 
that in another apartment were an equal number of women and girls, 
none of whom had any bed, or even straw to sleep on. Something 
called a blanket was allowed each one, and this comprehended bed 
and bedding, with a brick pavement for a floor. Among the females 
were two young women, about twenty years of age, sold to pay their 
jail expenses, being free, but having the misfortune to be arrested on 
suspicion, and not being able to bring the proof required, and having 
no friend to pay a few dollars, they must be sold into perpetual sla- 
very. Many free persons, I was informed, were often kidnapped, 
and carried on board of slave vessels, to be sold at New Orleans. 

A friend of mine had a boy whom he had bought Col $150, — to be 
free when 27 years old. A few days after the above-named visit, this 
boy was detected in stealing some articles from several boardeis in the 
house. He plead guilty to the charge, and produced the most valuable 
of the stolen articles. He was ordered to be stripped, and flogged as 
long as any life was left in him, and then have his back washed with 
salt and water,* and was then sent to jail, having, however, been 
previously put on oath to testify against a free colored man, who 
was committed to jail on his testimony, as being accessary. After 
being committed, the city constable returned and informed the holder, 
that he knew a slave-buyer who would give $350 for the boy, and 
take the risk of any complaint in regard to his being free at the age 
of 27, and strongly recommended that he should be sold! .' 

When your informamt left, they w r ere both [the slave and the FREE 
colored man convicted on his testimony] in the government prison, with 
about 50 other colored persons placed there for different offences, but 
most of them for inability to prove their freedom by w 7 hite witnesses. 

* A common practice — answering the double purpose of adding to the torture, and 
of hastening to restore the lacerated victim, that his master may not lose his time.

J 836.] DECEMBER — TWELFTH MONTH. 


[31 days. 




Congress meet on the 5th of this month. Can you say that you are 
opposed to slavery, if you have not signed a petition for its abolition 
at the seat of government ? ' Wo unto them that decree unrighteous 
decrees ' Are you not doing this by your representatives?

23 Anti-Slavery Almanac. [1836 



PRINCIPLES OF ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETIES. 

" Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Come and see." 

These societies are composed of men of all denominations, all polit- 
ical creeds, every variety of natural disposition; — they are scattered 
over a wide territory from Maine to Kentucky, in crowded cities and 
secluded hamlets; — they embrace the learned and unlearned, the rich 
and the poor: — and yet their principles, like the testimony of faithful 
eye-witnesses, appear to have emanated from one source; and so indeed 
they did. They are the offspring of One Eternal Mind. 

In looking over the many declarations of Anti-Slavery Societies, in 
order to give our readers a brief exposition of principles, we have found 
so much that was pure, elevated, and thrilling, that we have been at a 
loss what portion to choose. We give selections from the Declaration 
of the Ohio A. S. Convention, dated April 22, 1835, — the prospectus of 
the Liberator, Dec. 1832, and the Declaration of the National A. S. 
Convention, Dec. 6, 1S33. They are the principles contained in the 
Bible, and set forth in the Declaration of Independence. 

Slavery a Sin. 

We believe slavery to be a sin — sin, in itself, apart from its occa- 
sional rigors incidental to its administration, — sin, because it converts 
persons into things, makes men property, God's image merchandize. 

What is that but a sin, which sinks to the level of brutes, beings 
ranked and registered by God a little lower than the angels — wrests 
from their rightful owners the legacies which their Maker has be- 
queathed them — inalienable birthright endowments exchanged for 
no equivalent, unsurrendered by volition and unforfeited by crime — 
breaks open the sanctuary of human rights, and makes its sacred things 
common plunder — driving to the shambles Jehovah's image, herded 
with four-footed beasts and creeping things, and bartering for vile dust 
the purchase of a Redeemer's blood, and the living members of his 
body ? What is that but a sin, which derides the sanctity with which 
God has invested domestic relations — annihilates marriage — makes 
void parental authority, nullifies filial obligation — invites the violation 
of chastity by denying it legal protection, thus bidding God speed to 
lust as it riots at noon-day, glorying in the immunities of law ? 

Effects of Slavery. 
The influences of slavery upon slave-holders and the slave states, are 
an abiding sense of insecurity and dread — the press cowering under 
a censorship — freedom of speech struck dumb by proscription — a 
standing army of patrols to awe down insurrection — the mechanic 
arts and all vigorous enterprise crushed under an incubus — a thriftless 
agriculture smiting the land with barrenness and decay — industry 
held up to scorn — idleness a badge of dignity — profligacy no barrier 
to favor — concubinage encouraged by premium, the HIGH PRICE 
of the mixed race operating as a bounty upon amalgamation — prodi- 
gality, in lavishing upon the rich the plundered earnings of the poor,

accounted high-souled generosity — revenge regarded as the refine- 1 
ment of honor — aristocracy entitled republicanism, and despotism 
chivalry. 

It has desecrated our federal city, smitten with its leprosy our na- 
tional temple, turned its sacred courts into human shambles, and pro- 
vided seats for them that sell men. It is at war with the genius of 
our government, and divides it against itself. It scoffs at our national 
Declaration, brands us with hypocrisy before the nations, paralyzes 
the power of our free institutions at home, makes them a hissing and 
a by-woid abroad, and shouts our shame in the ears of the world. 

This is slavery — as it exists to-day, sheltered under the wings of 
our national eagle, republican law its protector, republican equality 
its advocate, republican morality its patron, freemen its body guard, 
the church its city of refuge, and the sanctuary of God and the very 
horns of the altar its inviolable asylum ! 

Against this whole system, we do with one accord, in the name of 
humanity and eternal right, record our utter detestation, and enter 
our solemn protest. Slavery being sin, we maintain that it is the 
duty of all who perpetrate it immediately to cease; in other words, 
that immediate emancipation is the sacred right of the slaves, and the 
imperative duty of their masters. — Ohio Declaration. 

Immediate Emancipation. 

By immediate emancipation we do not mean — 

That the slaves shall be turned loose upon the nation, to roam as 
vagabonds or aliens — nor 

That they shall be instantly invested with all political rights and 
privileges — nor 

That they shall be expelled from their native land to a foreign clime, 
as the price and condition of their freedom. But we mean — 

That, instead of being under the unlimited control of a few irre- 
sponsible masters, they shall really receive the protection of law : 

That the power which is now vested in every slave-holder to rob 
them of their just dues, to drive them into the fields like beasts, to 
lacerate their bodies, to sell the husband from his wife, the wife from 
her husband, and children from their parents, shall instantly cease : 

That the slaves shall be employed as free laborers, fairly compensa- 
ted, and fully protected in their earnings : 

That they shall be placed under a benevolent and disinterested 
supervision, which shall secure to them the right to obtain secular and 
religious knowledge, to worship God according to the dictates of their 
own consciences, to accumulate wealth, and to seek an intellectual 
and moral equality with their white competitors. — Garrison. 

Plan of Operation. 

We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in every city, 
town and village of our land. 

We shall send forth Agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance, of 
warning, of entreaty and rebuke. 

We shall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti-slavery tracts 
and periodicals. 

We shall enlist the pulpit and the press in the cause of the suf- 
fering and the dumb. 

3* 



3U Anti-Slavery Almanac. [l«3b 

We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participa- 
tion in the guilt of slavery. 

We shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves, 
by giving a preference to their productions ; — and 

We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation 
to speedy repentance. — Declaration of the A. A. S. Convention. 



YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT, 

Those who would paralyze our exertions and shut our mouths, in reference to our 
great national SIN, often tell us, that we at the north know nothing about, slavery, 
and that we must have nothing to do with it. We answer, first, that in questions of 
duty we- seek direction from the Scriptures of truth, and from the Fountain of wis- 
dom, — not from any inferior source. Eight and wrong are of the same nature, in all 
ages and places. We need not leave our own firesides to learn that man has no right to 
hole! his fellow man as property. Secondly, If we are ignorant, it is because the means 
of obtaining knowledge have been withheld. There has been a criminal neglect on 
the part of those who control the great avenues leading to the public mind. The man 
who repeats, this objection, should blush with shame. It is adding infamy to sin. 
We are scattering light and knowledge throughout the world, and striving to abolish 
every unholy practice, which exists in the most remote nations ; — but when we would 
turn our attention to a system of transcendant guilt in our own nation, we are met 
with the rude rebuff, '■Hands off! you knoiv nothing about the ■matter.'* But we ottght 
to know something about it, and we cannot remain innocently ignorant. Give us 
information. Let slavery be exhibited in the light of -day, if it will bear the light. 
We are participants in the crime, and are under solemn obligations to acquaint our- 
selves with its nature and its fruits. It is the duty of all who have light on this sub- 
ject, to spread it abroad., that we may act intelligently ; for, as we are personally im- 
plicated in this matter, WE MUST ACT. 

We are not, however, so destitute of information as our opponents wish we were. 
We derive much information from public documents. The_ following extiact3 will 
show that some of the important principles of northern abolitionists are advocated 
by southern legislators. The subject was discussed in the Virginia House of Dele- 
gates, Jau. 1832. The following are extracts from speeches made on that occasion. 



A VOICE FROM VIRGINIA. 

[Extract from the speech of John A. Chandler, of Norfolk Co.] 
After referring to the language used in the Bill of Rights, he says, 
' Has slavery interfered with our means of enjoying life, liberty, prop- 
erty, happiness and safety? Look at Southampton. The answer is 
written in letters of blood, upon the floors of that unhappy county.' 
. . ..' But,, sir, will this evil, this curse, not increase ? Will not the 
happiness and safety of those who may come after us, be endangered in 
a still greater degree by it ? How then can we reconcile it to ourselves 
to fasten this upon them? Do we not endanger our veiy national 
existence by entailing slavery upon them? . . . 

' The truth is, that our ancestors had NO TITLE to this property, 
and we have acquired it only by legislative enactments, sanctioned 
by the necessity of the case. It may be argued that length of 
time has created a title. Some thirty years ago, a frigate sailed on a 
cruise, and has never been heard of since. Imagine, for a moment, 
that it was now announced to this nation, that the ship had foundered 
on the coast of Africa, and her crew, or part of them, were SLAVES 
to some petty monarch in that country: — think you, sir, that we 
would listen to the plea of length of time ? No ; the voice of a mighty 
people, with resistless force, would proclaim that freemen can never 
be made slaves, and the hum of preparation to demand our long-lost 
brethren, would soon resound throughout the land.' 



1836] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 31 



[From the speech of Thomas J. Randolph of Albemarle.] 
' In the last 40 years, the whites in Eastern Virginia have increased 
51 per cent; the blacks 2.SCI P er cent. Forty years ago, the whites 
exceeded the colored 25,0U0 ; the colored now exceed the whites 81 ,000; 
a net gain of the blacks over the whites in 40 years of 106,000; and 
these results too, during an exportation of near 260,000 slaves since 
the year 1790, now, perhaps, the fruitful progenitors of half a million 
in other states.' . . . ' It is a practice, and an increasing practice, in parts 
of Virginia, to REAR SLAVES FOR MARKET. How can an 
honorable mind, a patriot, and a lover of his country, bear to see this 
ancient dominion converted into one-grand menagerie where men are 
to be reared for market, like oxen for the shambles ? Is it better, is it 
not worse than the [foreign] slave-trade, that trade which enlisted the 
labor of the good and the wise of every creed and every clime to 
abolish it? The trader receives the slave, a stranger in language, 
aspect, and manner, from the merchant who has brought him from the 
interior. The ties of father, mother, husband, and child, have all been 
rent in twain ; before he receives him his soul has become callous. 
But here, sir, individuals, whom the master has known from infancy,! 
whom he has seen sporting in the innocent gambols of childhood, who 
have been accustomed to look to him for protection, he TEARS from 
the MOTHER'S ARMS, and sells into a strange country, among 
strange people, subjkct to cruel task-masters. In my opinion, 
sir, IT IS MUCH WORSE.' 

' He [a member who preceded him] has attempted to justify slavery 
here, because it exists in Africa, and has stated that it exists all over 
the world. Upon the same principle, he could justify any of the 
abominations and enormities of savage tribes. Does slavery exist in 
any part of civilized Europe? JS'o, sir, in no part of it. America is 
the only civilized Christian natiok that bears the opprobrium ! 
In every other country where civilization and Christianity have ex- 
isted together, they have erased it from their codes, — they have 
blotted it from the page of their history.' 

Have civilization and Christianity no efficacy, in this country? Shall they ever be 
a theme of reproach for the savage and the heathen ? 

[From the speech of James M'Dowell, Jr. of Rockbridge.] 

1 Who, sir, that looks at this property as a legislator, and marks its 
effect on our national advance, but weeps over it as the worst of pat- 
rimonies ? Who that looks to this unhappy bondage of our unhappy 
people in the midst of our society, and thinks of its incidents and its 
issues, but weeps over it as a curse upon him who inflicts, as upon him 
who surfers it ? 

' If I am to judge from the tone of our debate, from the concessions 
on all hands expressed, there is not a man in this body, not one, per- 
haps, that is even represented here, who would not have thanked the 
generations that have gone before us, if, acting as public men, they 
had brought this bondage to a close.' . . . ' Proud as are the names for 
intellect and patriotism which enrich the volumes of our history, that 
name — that man — above all parallel would hare been the chief, who 
could have blotted out this curse from his country.'* . . . 

*And yet, if you relieve them from this dreadful curse, you must give tbem 

Compensation! 



Anti-Slavery Almanac. 



[1836 



' Slavery has come down to us from our fathers, and the question 
now is, shall we, in turn, hand it over to our children ? Hand it over 
to them aggravated in every attribute of evil? Shall we perpetuate 
the calamity we deplore, and become to posterity, the objects, not of 
kindness, but of cursing ? 

* Sir, you may place the slave where you please, — you may dry 
up, to your utmost, the fountains of his feelings, the springs of his 
thought, — you may close upon his mind every avenue to knowledge, 
and cloud it over with artificial night, — you may yoke him to your 
labor as the ox, which liveth only to work, and worketh only to live — 
you may put him under any process which, without destroying his 
value as a slave, will debase and crush him as a rational being; — 
you may do tins, and the idea that he was born to be free will survive 
it all. It is allied to his hope of immortality — it is the ethereal part 
of his nature which oppression cannot reach; it is a torch lit up in his 
soul by the hand of the Deity, and never meant to be extinguished by 
the hand of man.' [How fanatical !] 

' Admitting the subject cannot be approached without danger now, 
the great question for us to determine is, whether, by delay, it may 
not become fearfully worse, and in process of time attain a magnitude 
far transcending our feeble powers.' . . .< Gentlemen say, let things 
alone ; the evil will correct itself. • We may let things alone, but they 
will not let us alone.' . . . ' There is a still small voice, which speaks 
to the heart of man in a tone too clear and distinct to be disregarded. 
It tells him that EVERY SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IS BASED 
UPON INJUSTICE AND OPPRESSION. If gentlemen disregard 
it now, and lull their consciences to sleep, they may be aroused to a 
sense of their danger, when it is too late to repair their errors.' 

' If slavery can be eradicated, let us get rid of it. If it cannot, let 
that melancholy fact be distinctly ascertained ; and let those who are 
now awaiting with painful solicitude the result of your determination, 
pack up their household goods, and find among the prairies of the 
west, that security and repose which their native land does not afford.' 

Many interesting extracts from the same debate, are given in the "Testimony of 
God against Slavery," by La Hoy Sunderland. 



PR.ODUCE OF SLAVE LABOR— By C. Stuart. 

Why do slave holders keep slaves? 

For the sake of the produce of their labor. 

What makes them want the labor of slaves ? 

To make money by it. 

How can they make money by it ? 

By getting people to buy, sell and consume its productions. 

If they could not get any body to buy these productions, would they 
keep slaves ? 

Certainly not. 

What relation then is there between slave-holders, and the buyers, 
venders, and consumers of the produce of slave labor. 

The slave-holders are merely the hirelings of the consumers : — as 
slavery produces the slave-trade — so, buying, selling, and consuming 
the fruits of slave-labor, produces slavery. — Appetite creates a de^ 
mand for sugar, coffee, rice, cotton, &,c. &c.,and slave masters know 



1^36 1 Anti-Slavery Almanac. 33 

that this appetite is strong and universal enough, to secure a market, 
however it is supplied. They do not make sugar in order to oppress 
or destroy the slave, but in order to make money ; and their guilt is, 
that when they find, that they cannot make money so conveniently 
without oppression, they rather oppress than not make money. 

The buyers, venders and consumers of slave produce hold out the i 
lure and supply the motive. — They say, " We want sugar," &c. Thej 
slave-holders reply, " We will get sugar for you." — "How? " cry the 
consumers — " By the forced and unrequited toil of the guiltless poor," 
return the slave-holders. — " We wish you would get it for us," cry 
the others, "by paying your laborers fair wages, and by treating them 
like men." "That we will not," retort the slave-holders. — "But 
that is too bad," exclaim the consumers — " you are a set of men-steal- 
ers, and we abhor your system. — But we must have sugar! — We 
will raise societies against slavery. — We will petition Congress. — We 
will proclaim your guilt from the Pulpit, the Press and the Lecture 
room. — We know indeed that you would not keep slaves, if we did 
not hire you to do so. — But sugar we must have, cost what it may. — 
Here is our money. — Go — send your slaves to the field — drive on 
— never mind their wrongs — regard not their blood. — Yet, it is a 
horrible crime to keep slaves. — Oh, how we pity them ! " 

The consumers of slave produce consume it, not in order to sup- 
port slavery, but in order to please their appetites. — Their guilt is, 
that when they find, that they cannot get sugar so conveniently with- 
out having and supporting oppression, they rather support oppression, 
than not have sugar. — Appetite calls. — The consumer holds out his 
money. — The slave-holder takes it and does the work. — The plun- 
dered and outraged slave is hastening to meet them both at the bar of 
God. 



TO CHILDREN. — Imitation of Miss BarbaulcVs Seasons. 

Who is this that is walking to and fro in the land, with a forehead 

of brass, and a heart of steel? One of her hands is rilled with whips 

and fetters. In the other she grasps the hire of the laborer, which is 

kept back by fraud. Wherever she sets her foot, the land is cursed. 

j Thorns and briers spring up around her. Decay and ruin mark her 

jpath. Her breath is deadly poison. Churches and schools shrink 

I away from her approach. The colored man is filled with horror as 

she advances. She crushes his energies, and seeks to blot out his 

mind. Shrieks and groans are the music she delights to hear. 

I Hearts broken with anguish are her food Blood and tears are her 

drink. She tramples the Bible under her feet, and defies its Author. 

She loves darkness, and tries to cover herself with a thick veil. She 

has a multitude of flatterers, and many mouths are filled with her 

praise. She corrupts watchmen by bribery. They warn not the 

people against her. Lawgivers tremble at her frown. She laughs 

at their feeble efforts to oppose her. Youths and maidens, do you 

know this frightful monster ? Can you tell me her name ? 



Mr. Thome of Kentucky once said, "The plantations of the south 
are grave-yards of the mind : the inexpressive countenances of the 
slaves are monuments of souls expired, — and their spiritless eyes 
are their epitaphs."

1 Most of the slaves are not allowed to learn to read, 
and therefore cannot search the Scriptures. 

2 In Georgia, any Justice of the Peace may at his dis- 
cretion break up any religious assembly of slaves, and 
may order each slave present, to be " corrected, without 
trial, by receiving on the bare back twenty-five stripes, 
with a whip, switch or cowskin." Str. 91, 93. 

In Virginia, all evening meetings of slaves, or of free 
blacks or mulattoes associating with slaves, are forbidden. 

Laws of similar tendency exist in many of the slave - 
holding states. 

3 The laws recognize not the parental relation as be- 
longing to slaves. A slave has no more legal authority 
over his child than domesticated brutes have over their 

young. 

4 The law affords no protection to the marriage of slaves. 
They may indeed be formally married, but so far as legal 
rights and obligations are concerned, it is an idle cere- 
mony. The connection may at any time be legally broken 
up, to gratify the avarice or licentiousness of the master. 

5 In Georgia, if a white teach a FREE negro or slave 
to read or write, he is fined $500. and imprisoned at the 
discretion of the court. If the offender be a colored man, 
bond or free, he is to be fined or whipped. Of course a 
father may be flogged for teaching his own child! The 
law was passed in 1829. 

In N. C. it is unlawful to teach a slave to read or write, 
or to sell or give him any book or pamphlet, Bible not excepted. 

In Lou. the penalty for teaching slaves to read or write 
is one year's imprisonment. 

6 In N. C. it is unlawful for a colored man to preach 
the gospel, whatever his attainments or piety. 

In Geo. if a FREE negro preaches to his companions, 
or exhorts them, he may be seized without warrant, and 
whipped thirty-nine lashes, and the same number of lashes 
may be applied to each of his congregation. 

7 In Louisiana, the penalty for instructing & free black 
in a SABBATH SCHOOL, is for the first offence five 
hundred dollars, — for the second offence DEATH. 

Though similar laws do not exist in the other states, yet 
there are but very few Sabbath schools for slaves. In 1830, 
the number of slaves under the age of 24, was 1,322,490 ; 
No. of free colored persons in slave states under24, 108,149. 

8 In S. C. any assembly of free negroes, even in pres- 
ence of white persens, " in a confined or secret place, for 
the purpose of mental instruction," is an unlawful as- 
sembly, and may be dispersed by the magistrate, who is 
authorized to inflict twenty lashes on each free negro, mu 
latto or slave attending the meeting. Stroud, 89. 

9 In S. C. if a free negro entertains a runaway slave, he 
forfeits £10, and if unable to pay the fine, as must almost 
always be the case, he is sold as a slave for life. In 1827, 
a free woman a>id her three children were thus sold for har 
boring two slave children. 

10 In Ky. white men suffer death for four crimes only, 
slaves for 11. In Va. there are 71 crimes for which slaves 

; suffer death, and whites nothing worse than imprisonment 



ther did according to his 
will, shall be beaten with 
many stripes. But he that 
knew not, and did commit 
things worthy of stripes, 
shall be beaten with few 
stripes. Luke 12 : 47, 48. 

11 One witness shall not 
rise up against a man for 
any iniquity, or for any sin: 
at the mouth of two wit- 
nesses, or at the mouth of 
three witnesses, shall the 
matter be established. 

Deut. J9- 15. 

12 Thou shalt not deliv- 
er unto his master the ser- 
vant which is escaped from 
his master unto thee. 

Deut. 23: 15. 

13 Ye shall hallow the fif- 
tieth year, & proclaim l.b- 
erty throu'out all the land, 
unto ALL the inhabitants 
thereof. Lev. 25: 10. 



In Mississippi these offences are 38 in number, and for 
several of them whites are not punished at all. 

The slave is without religious instruction, unable to 
read, too ignorant to comprehend legislation, and probably 
does not know of the existence of half the laws by which 
he suffers. Thus slave-holders do in effect say, ' Where 
Uttle is given, much shall be required.' 

11 Neither a slave or FREE colored person can be a 
witness against any free white man, in a court of justice, 
in any case, but they may testify against a slave or free col- 
oredman, even in cases affecting life. Stroud says., this law 
"places the slave, who is seldom in view of more than 
one white perso i at a time, entirely at the mercy of this 
individual." (p. 66 ) He has a full license to commit any 
CRIME with impunity, for it cannot be provedagainst him. 

12 Not only do the slave holding states break this law 
in their intercourse with one another, but the free states 
(as the Constitution is generally interpreted) have enter- 
ed into a solemn compact with slave-holders to ; set it at 
defiance. 

13 Tn this ' land of liberty,' slavery is declared by law 
to be perpi tual. Laws exist in most of the southern states 
which forbid or discourage emancipation. Slavery ha? 
existed in this land two hundred years. Spread light and 
truth abroad, and soon the '■Tramp of Jubilee'' will sound. 



The above are only a few of the many particulars in which the 
slave laws are in direct opposition to the laws of God. Are we pre- 
sumptuous in saying- that they are " before God utterly null and void," 
and that " they ought to be instantly abrogated ?" 

These laws afford a melancholy proof that " what begins in injustice 
must be carried on in crime." If slavery were a "rightful relation,'' 
it could not lean for support on laws of such heaven-daring atrocity. 
By enacting them slave-holders have published to the world that slavery 
is in its own nature anti-christian and tyrannical, and that it can only 
be supported by adding sin to sin Slavery is the corrupt root from 
which all these bitter fruits proceed. Abolitionists are aiming heavy 
blows directly at the root, and every branch, twig and leaf of the sys- 
tem shows, by its trembling, that the blows are taking effect. Reader, 
are you assisting in the work ? If not, are you prepared with an excuse 
to render at the judgment of the great day ? 



FEMALES OF NEW ENGLAND. 

You, who are the favored inheritors of a country irradiated by the 
purest beams of heavenly truth; blest by freedom so perfect, that,

by comforts, gratifications and luxuries, showered in rich profusion —

come forth, and engage in the defence cf a large class of your fellow 
immortals, and of a countless host of ' daughters yet unborn,' who are 
doomed to cheerless bondage, compulsory heathenism, unrequited and 
unpitied toil, and who are shut out from all the tender charities and 
comforts of life. We ask you to engage in no enterprise of extrava- 
gant purpose, or of doubtful utility; but in the sober cause of truth,

justice, and benevolence. Come forth, then, under the guidance of 
the three Christian Graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity. In full assu- 
rance of Faith, founded on the rock of divine authority, and with 
Hope, anchored on the same immutable basis, in every difficulty that

cease, and knowledge vanish away,' that grace which ' never faileth,' 
Charity, ' the bond of perfectness,' shall finally unite the rescued 
race to those who have been made the favored instruments of their 
salvation, in the everlasting kingdom of their common Savior.

A WOMAN FOR SALE ! 

[The following is from the Portland Advertiser. It occurred in March, ]833.] 
Within ten feet of the office of the Richmond Enquirer, there was 
on an auction flag the following amusing advertisement : ' By virtue 
of an order of the Hastings Court for the city of Richmond, pronounc- 
ed on the 22d day of February, [Washington's birth day, mark ye,] 
will be sold, in front of the High Constable's office, on Monday the 
II th inst. one bright mulatto woman, about 26 years of age; (very 
likely.) also some empty barrels and sundry old candle boxes, £-c, to 
satisfy the above attachment, and all costs attending the same.' This 
was dated March 1st, and regularly signed. As I was going by the 
crowd, and this auction flag, I was struck with the question of the 
auctioneer, who seemed to have his eye on me. ' Do you want to buy 
a woman?'' I then read the advertisement, and remembered that I 
was in a land where slaves and horses were commodities equally 
marketable. ' Do you want to buy a woman ? ' was the interrogation 
pressed upon every passer-by. The auctioneer was loudly exclaiming, 
two hundred dollars, only two hundred dollars for this likely woman. 
Two hundred and ten shall I say ? Two hundred and ten, 210, 210 
— who bids ? 215, 215 — a likely woman — 21 5, only 215 — 215 — a 
good seamstress, stout, healthy — only 215 — 220 — is a good cook — 
230, only 230 dollars bid — 235 — 240— 245— 250,250 — going, a wo- 
man a going for only 250 dollars — 260, only 260, 260, shall I knock 
her off for only 260 dollars ? 260 dollars is the only bid. 270, did you 
say ? yes, 270, 270, 270, as fine a woman as was ever under the ham- 
mer — 275 — 280 — 290 — 300 1 am bid. 300 dollars for a woman 
worth 500 dollars. 310, going, a woman going for 310 dollars — fine, 
likely, stout — 315, 320 dollars, a going, a going — speak quick, a go- 
ing, a going, a going, going, and — and — and — agoing, for 320 dol- 
lars — and — and — gone to Mr. .' 

I give you details because they interested me beyond measure — 
and I think you have readers who will not be less interested than I 
was, in the details of the auction. The woman trotted off with her 
new master, and I busied myself with inquiring into the particulars. 
I learned that her husband was free, and that he bought her a slave, 
and then married her. Thus she was his wife and his slave, and he 
held her by a double tenure, and could sell her when he pleased. The 
husband got into debt and then ran off, — and his wife was attached 
as his slave, and sold by order of the Court, to pay the debt.

NEGRO HUNT. 

By the unsolicited kindness of Mrs. Child, we have been permitted 
to use some of the elegant engravings which appeared in the Oasis. 
We have placed one of them opposite the Calendar page for Novem- 
ber, to remind our northern sportsmen that while they are amusing 
themselves in hunting the wild game of the forest, others are em- 
ployed in bunting those whom God has stamped with his own image. 
The engraving, in the Oasis, accompanies a very interesting and af- 
fecting article, in which several " Negro Hunts" are mentioned; of 
which the author was himself a witness. 

The writer speaks of the man with whom he resided, as " an opulent 
planter, in the interior of Georgia, in whose family the evils of slave- 
holding were palliated by every expedient that a humane and generous 
disposition could suggest." But though the proprietor " was distin- 
guished for his generosity and kindness of heart," his overseer " was 
a man of depraved character, and a victim to brandy." This apparent 
anomaly is accounted for from the fact that a good man is seldom 
willing to become a slave-driver, and consequently the master is often 
obliged to employ bad ones or none. 

Four of the slaves on this plantation, having been treated with ex- 
treme cruelty by the overseer, deserted, and took to the woods, where 
they had not remained long, however, before he discovered their re- 
treat, and informed the master. They stayed in an extensive, swampy 
forest, and lived upon such provision as they could carry off from the i 
neighboring plantations. A night was agreed upon between the over- ! 
seer, and several adjoining planters, for a hunt. At midnight, when I 
active preparations were making for the expedition, a scene occurred, ! 
which the writer thus describes: "The children of the family had 
partaken of the general excitement, and arisen from their beds. As I 
entered the room, I could hear one of the youngest of them say, ' Why, 
pa, you would not kill Ralph, would you ? ' — 'I would take him, and i 
sell him, and get money for him,' said the next in age. 'You will 
only lame him, I suppose, so as to seize him,' said the mother. ' I 
would rather kill him, than the best fat buck in all the country,' re- , 
plied the father, as he rammed down the heavy charge." 

New England mothers, would the wealth of the world tempt you 
to expose your children to the influence of such a scene? 

The hunt, that night, was unavailing ; but a few days after, an in- 
vitation was sent, some distance, for a man whose dogs were famed 
for their scent, and whose death-dealing rifle had been repeatedly tried 
for a similar purpose. The gang which was to be taken consisted of 
the four slaves above mentioned, and several others, from different 
plantations, who had joined them. The rifle of the fortunate hunter 
laid Ralph bleeding upon the ground. Others were wounded less 
dangerously, and some were secured without injury. 

Reasonable request. We are natives of this country ; we ask only 
to be treated as well as foreigners. Not a few of our fathers suffered 
and bled to purchase its independence ; we ask only to be treated as viell 
as those who fought against it. We have toiled to cultivate it, and to 
raise it to its present prosperous condition ; we ask only to share equal 
privileges with those who come from distant lands to enjoy the fruits 
of our labor. — Rev. Peter Williams, (a colored man) Rector of St. '

38 Anti-Slavery Almanac. [183G 



EXTRACTS FROM A CHRISTIAN SLAVEHOLDER'S DIARY. 

Sabbath, May 21, 182- . Attended church to-day ; heard Mr. 
preach a Missionary sermon. Was very eloquent. Text — 



i Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' 
Displayed m glowing colors, the wretched state of the heathen, who 
are holden in the 'bondage of sin; and most affectingly described 
the dark places of the earth, which are full of the habitations of cru- 
elty. My feelings were greatly moved ; — in the collection taken up at 

the close of the service, gave dollars ; all the profit which I made 

yesterday in trading off my negro Sam, to parson G. Should have 
given more, but for the loss I experienced last week in the death of 
Bill, who took cold after being < flogged.' — Shall attend the auction 
to-morrow, and if I make a profitable bargain — as I hope to, for the 
slaves of squire B. must be sold — I shall remember the poor heathen. 
After Church, had to wait ten or fifteen minutes for my coachman; 
wondered why he did not come — when he came, he was unwilling 
to tell the reason of his delay ; promised him a flogging. When 1 
reached home, found he had been looking at the pictures in my' great 
Bible,'' — which was what detained him : gave him a sound flogging 
— as I never lie to my negroes — and told him if he ever touched the 
Bible again, I would double the castigation. This evening, heard a 
great noise in my outer kitchen — approached, to learn the cause, and 
found Sal, wailing bitterly, because I sold her son Sam, yesterday, 
to Parson G. ; told the foolish creature to be silent, or I would horse- 
whip her, as I could not be disturbed, — Finding she would not be 
quiet, I took my horse-whip, and let her feel the lash two or three 
times, which stilled her for the night. 

Monday, 22. — After morning pra3'ers, ordered my coach, for the 
purpose of attending the auction at 'Squire B's. Sale commenced at 
10 o'clock ; — he had a fine lot of negroes, two or three elegant horses, 
and considerable other live stock for sale. One of his servants, how- 
ever, had lost an eye, by the stroke of a whip : — strange that men will 
be so blind to their oxen interests, as not to be more careful where they 
strike, when they correct their slaves ! Bought a very likely looking 
young fellow, of about five and twenty, who I think will answer ad- 
mirably for a groom ; — he had one boy, three or four years old, who 
was bought by brother C, whom I saw at the communion table, yes- 
terday j — his wife was ' knocked off,' I think, to Rev. Mr. of 

, who wanted a wet nurse ; she having lost her child, by hav- 
ing been worked a little too heard the day belbre its birth. — Bought 
several others, at a very low rate, whom I intend for the plantation. 
On returning home, found, to my sore vexation, that Sal had cut her 
throat, for grief at being separated from her boy, whom 1 sold last 
Saturday. This loss will so far counterbalance the good bargains 1 
made at the auction to-day, that I shall not, for the present, be able 
to give any more for the conversion of the -poor heathen. 

Tuesday, 23. — Rode to my plantation to-day ; — looked into the 
cottage of my old slave, Sambo, and found him dead ! — Poor fellow ; 
— he was long a good servant, but for some time has not been able to 
earn his living. 1 intended to have given him his freedom, but it is 
now too late. — Wife says I must buy another woman to take Sal's 
place ; — regret that I did not buy the wife of my groom ; — though 1 
suppose it would have disappointed the minister. Boston Telegraph.

Yarrima, for that was the mother's name, ran out to the place where 
she saw the children last, calling, " Yazoo ! Yazoo!" but she heard 
no answer. Urged by a mother's love, she rushed forward, towards 
the hut of her nearest neighbor. But soon she saw the tracks of white 
men in the sand, and the foot prints of little children with them. At 
sight of these, she uttered a shriek of anguish, for then she knew that 
her little boy was stolen. Those men, whose faces you can see at. the 
left side of the picture, had carried off all the boys that had been so 
happy at their play. Though Yarrima knew that the men would catch 
her, if they saw her, yet she ran on towards the sea shore, calling 
" Yazoo." as loud as she could. She climbed to the top of the highest 
rock on the shore, and saw the white man's boat moving rapidly over 
the water towards a distant vessel. I have not room to tell you more. 
If you can get the Oasis, you will there learn what became of Yazoo, 
and his father and mother. 

Those white men stole the little boys because they knew they could 
carry them to places where men kept slaves, and get money for them. 
There are are a great many slaves in this country. The girls and

boys in Utica, N. Y. and the girls in Providence, R. I. and in some 
other places, have formed themselves into Anti-Slavery Societies, and 
have done something for the slaves. In Providence, the girls worked 
with their needles, and made watch-guards, bead bags, and many 
other pretty and useful articles. They put some little sentences about 
the slaves into the things they made, so that those who bought them 
might be often put in mind of those who are held in bondage. 

One sentence used by them was this : " May the use of our needles 
prick the consciences of slave-holders." I once saw a pretty watch- 
guard made by them, in which they had worked the sentence, 
" O sons of freedom, equalize your laws ; 
Be all consistent, plead the negro's cause." 

When they had sold the things they had made, they had thirty 
dollars to send to the treasurer of the American Anti-Slavery Society. 
This is enough to pay for 3600 eopies of the paper called Human 
Rights, or 4600 copies of the Slave's Friend. I think it will be so 
used as to "prick the consciences" of many slave-holders. If you 
will turn to page 12, you will see that the American Society rejoices 
in the formation of Juvenile Anti-Slavery Societies, and earnestly de- 
sires that they may be formed in all parts of the country. When the 
Almanac is printed for next year, I hope I shall be able to tell of many 
societies of children, who are showing their thankfulness for the bless- 
ings they enjoy, by doing something for the wretched slave children. 



Isaiah. 



WHERE IS THY BROTHER? 

" What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the 
faces of the poor ? saith the Lord God of hosts. 

What mean ye that ye bruise and bind 

My people, saith the Lord, 
And starve your craving brother's mind, 

That asks to hear my word? 

What mean ye that ye make them toil 

Through long and dreary years, 
And shed like rain upon your soil 

Their blood and bitter tears ? 

W r hat mean ye that ye dare to rend 

The tender mother's heart; 
Brothers from sisters, friend from friend, 

How dare you bid them part? 

What mean ye, when God's bounteous hand 

To you so much has given, 
That from the slave who tills your land 

You keep both earth and heaven ? 

When at the judgment God shall call, 

Where is thy BROTHER? say, 
What mean ye to the Judge of all 

To answer on that day?. E.

1&3()] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 41 

TO SLAVE-HOLDERS. 

[The following, though addressed to an individual, is designed for 
all, who hold human beings as their property.] 

To D. S,, Esq. , Virginia. 

^ To justify yourself for keeping your fellow men in slavery, you 
allege that you treat them well. They have no reason, you say, to 
complain of their tasks, or food, or clothing. You do not allow them 
to be shocked with execrations, or cut with whips, or burnt with irons. 
You are a kind master, every way ; and have no doubt, that your 
slaves love you tenderly and warmly. But all this, is just nothino' to 
the purpose. You do not touch the point where 1 would direct your 
eye and. fix your thoughts. I was not charging you with guilt in 
treating your slaves cruelly ; but in robbing thtm of to hat distinguished 
them from dogs. I charge you with seizing your own brethren, and, 
as far as you are able, reducing them to dogs. Your starving them or 
feeding them ; your kicking them or caressing them is altogether an 
incidental thing. It does not reach the spot, where your blame lies. 
However you may treat them, while you hold them as your slaves, 
you treat them not like men, as they are ; but like dogs, as they are 
not. And have you the face to say, that you are not to blame for 
turning human beings into brute beasts, merely because in doing so. 
you may not add some petty violence to this dreadful outrage ? A 
skilful hand and a keen razor, then, by which the life of your child 
may, without affright or pain, be taken away, ought to clear the act 
from the guilt of murder ! No, no. Your wickedness lies in robbing 
your fclloics of their dearest rigJds. And this act cannot be so per- 
formed as to change its nature. It is the act itself, however 
performed, which I call on you in the name of God and human na- 
ture, to hate, deplore and renounce. All nature is against you in this 
thing. And while anything of nature remains in me, 1 must still 
urge you to take your hand from your brother's throat ; and while any- 
thing of nature remains in you, you cannot help feeling, that so you 
ought to do. 

" But the Bible.''' I wonder much how, as a slave-holder, you came 
to betake yourself to the Bible for encouragement and support. To 
which of the precepts of the Bible does not the system, of which 
you are a living part, stand directly opposed? Which of these pre- 
cepts may the slave obey ? To ascertain his relations, duties, pros- 
pects, may he "Search the Scriptures?" May he employ all 
the time and means, which may be requisite, to make him " grow in 
the knowledge " of Jesus Christ; to enable him, " leaving the 
principles of the doctrine of Christ," to " go on unto per- 
fection?" Thus may he "let his light shine," by honoring 
the doctrines and precepts of the Savior ? Dare you appeal to the 
Word of God, in support of a system of theft, and adultery, and mur- 
der? You know, that slavery, under every aspect and influence, is a 
direct and foul attack upon the broad precept of the Gospel ; " Thou, 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. " And yet you quote the Bible, to 
justify your slave-holding ! For shame ! Give over such a task to those 
hold blasphemers, who, in priestly robes and in sacred places, dare to 
throw the Bible, as a shield, over a system of pollution and blood. 

You assure me, " that your slaves are not fit for freedom.'" How 
can that be ? A number of them were born on your premises, and

have always been under your control. Your own sons, trained by 
your hand, you regard as fit for freedom; and you assert, that your 
slaves have in no respect any reason to complain of the treatment 
they have received from so kind a master. Yet you now so boldly 
declare, that they are not fit for freedom ! Strange kindness you must 
have shown them ; to leave them twenty-five or thirty years so much 
neglected and degraded, as to be unfit to be trusted with themselves; 
That is to treat men like dogs, with a witness. 

But you mean "-to train them to act the part of freemen:' How ? 
By giving them the education of slaves ! Why , you beat the fool, who 
said he never would trust himself to the water, till he had learned to 
swim ! How can men be trained for freedom by being kept, in sla- 
very ? To be trained for freedom, they must breathe the spirit and 
cherish the sentiments, and exert the powers, and form the habits of 
freedom. And can they do this, with a yoke upon their necks ? — 
But what are you doing to prepare them for the rights and privileges 
which your sons so freely enjoy and so exultingly describe ? Why ; 
you keep them under the crushing force of iron laws and barbarous 
usages, which are adapted and designed to prevent them from escap 
ing from the ignorance and degradation, which, you say, unfit them 
for freedom ! When, at this rate, and under such influences, will 
they be prepared to walk at large ? 

But you dare not " let them go ; " they would hurt themselves and 
injure everybody else ! For what ? What would drive them to those 
dreadful excesses, which you so pathetically describe ? They love 
you now, you affirm, though you have robbed them of their dearest 
rights; but if you should turn around, and treat them like men; — 
yielding them their rights with a hearty good-will ; — why, they 
would be sure to hate you ! A conclusion too glaringly absurd to 
need refutation. 

" But they would be unable to take care of themselves." Their 
brethren, even in Virginia, who liave escaped from servitude, you 
fear would, if let alone, take care of themsplves — as special pains arc 
taken to depress their spirits and cripple their efforts, to prevent 
them from doing so. What would you think of a community, 
which should do everything in its power to discourage the enterprise 
and embarrass the industry of its poor; and then justify itself for 
putting them under hard measures, by the pretence, that such people 
cannot take care of themselves. This is covering cruelty with hj T - 
pocrisy. — You have work enough now for your slaves, which they 
perform under the influence of motives., which are adapted to depress 
their feelings and cripple their energies. ' Would they not, with higher 
motives, perform the same work as well ? Give them wages instead of 
stripes, and see. 

" The laics are in the way of emancipation" What have you done 
to get such laws repealed ? Nay ; 1 have heard you say strong things 
in their favor. Such laws, you said, are necessary and useful. How 
very convenient, to support laws which justify your crimes ! — And 
then, do the laws oblige you to go to New York to hunt up and drag 
away the poor fugitives, who had escaped from your iron grasp ? If 
you were not a tyrant, heartily in favor of oppression, you would let 
him alone. An honest man would sooner die, than obey a law, which 
required him to rob his brethren of their rights. Such laws are the 
grossest form, which human wickedness can take; if we except the 



1836] Anti-Slavery Almanac. 43 



blasphemy, by which modern Baalams try to force God himself to 
speak in favor of such bloody legislation. 

Ah, my friend ; you cannot justify yourself in doing to others, what 
you would rather be crucified than have them do to you. Why not 
let go of your brother's throat ? If you hold him fast, he may hurt 
you amidst the hard struggles by which he may try to get away. 
Prompt and hearty restitution may save you. Nothing else will do. 
You have hot iron in your hand. You cannot " let go " too soon. If 
you choose to hold on to your usurped authority, you will be sorry 
for your folly. But when God shall visit your iniquity upon your 
head, you shall not say, you were never warned. 

Do the slaves desire their freedom? There are in the city of Cin- 
cinnati 47G colored persons who have paid more than TWO HUN- 
DRED THOUSAND DOLLARS for their liberty. ($215,522.) And 
yet it is sometimes said, " They would n't take their freedom if their 
masters would give it to them." Will Yankees believe it? 



YE WHO HAVE PENS PREPARE TO USE THEM NOW. 

We feel very grateful to the few correspondents who have so kindly 
assisted us in preparing the matter for this number of the Almanac. 
They will not fail of their reward. We would respectfully suggest to 
the multitude of anti-slavery writers, who have shown their ability in | 
the use of their pens, that there is probably no way in which they can 
accomplish more in the cause of human rights by the same amount of 
labor, than in writing for this Almanac. We wish to have a great 
variety of articles, to give life and spirit to the ensuing numbers. 
To those who write poetry, we would recommend the article on page 
40 as a model. It combines simplicity, brevity, perspicuity and unity. 

We have not the vanity to recommend any of our prose articles as 
models, but we must be permitted to offer a few hints to writers of prose. 

1. Do not write unless you have clear, distinct and vivid impressions 
of the subject you intend to treat upon. 

2. Use plain, direct and forcible language, so as to convey your 
ideas distinctly to the minds of your readers. 

3. Carefully avoid all expletives, and superfluous words and phrases. 

4. Articles for the Almanac MUST be SHORT. If you have 
much to say, divide it into several short articles, but do not expect 
that we can insert a long one. 

Mathematicians, who have leisure, can furnish us with a series of; 
interesting population tables, founded on a comparison of the census 
of 1820 with that of 1830, exhibiting the number of slaves, free colored 
persons, and whites, in the several slave-holding states, for the years 
1840, '50 'GO, '70, &c. Facts, anecdotes, statistics, remarkable events, 
etcsetera, connected with the subject of slavery, will be very acceptable. 

Correspondents can, if they please, forward their articles to us 
without taxing us with postage. The price of the Almanac is so very 
low that we cannot afford to pay any extra expense. W 7 hen merchants 
or others are coming to Boston, hand your communications to them, 
directed u Webster & Southard, 9, Cornhill, Boston." If they are 
left at No. 144, Nassau st. N. Y. in care of R. G. Williams, or at the 
office of the Herald of Freedom, Concord, N. H. we can obtain them 
from either of those places.

LIST OF ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETIES. 


We have devoted much time and labor to the preparation of this 


list, and still it is imperfect and probably incorrect. Those who are 


aware of the difficulties of such an undertaking, will readily excuse 


our errors, — to others it would be in vain for us to attempt an expla- 


nation. We thank those who have sent us information respecting the 
societies with which they are connected, and regret that we have not 
room to refer to any of them more particularly.
