Of such as have not yet taken action, and to whom this sheet makes the first call they ever heard, 
upon their love of freedom and sympathy for humanity, we entreat a co-operation the more energetic 
for the long delay. Let each one who receives this address take a table at the Tenth Massachusetts 
Anti- Slavery Fair, or unite with others for the purpose. Much may be done in two mouths, by dint 
of industry, ingenuity, taste and determination. 

The Liberty Bell is to be published as usual, and we ask a few dollars from each town to de- 
fray the expense of publication. The funds raised by this book are always paid into the Fair, and it 
always doubles the money invested in it. 

All the friends who live in evergreen districts are entreated to search before the snow falls for the 
wreaths of running pine, &c, with which to ornament the two halls which wo shall occupy. 
The Fair is to be held at Amory Hall, and the Christmas Tree, with appropriate musical services, is 
to be exhibited at the Melodeon, which is to be floored over for the occasion, and arrangements for 
exit and entrance so planned as to prevent the inconvenience from a crowd experienced last year. 

The funds raised are to be expended under the direction of the Massachusetts Anti- Slavery Soci- 
ety, which is unconnected with any religious sect, political party, or peculiar opinion, and whose sole 
object is to abolish slavery by the regeneration of public sentiment, urging upon each man the appli- 
cation of his own principles of action for this end. 

Wishing that every reader of this communication might share with us the satisfaction imparted by 
efforts in the noble undertaking to which many of us have devoted our best years, 
"VVe are respectfully,

ADDRESS OF THE COMMITTEE 






r 



OF THE 



Sentl) StXaBsattynstttB anti-Slaucri) fair. 



All that persons of feeling and humanity need know of Slavery, to ensure their best wishes and 
aid for its extinction, is, that it exists. Statistics, arguments and appeals are for those whose intellects 
consciences and hearts are blinded and hardened by participation in the system. The Committee ot 
the Tenth Massachusetts Anti- Slavery Fa!r need only give notice, therefore, of their inten- 
tion to hold it at Arnory Hall and the Melodeon, on Christmas and New- Year's Week, and entreat 
your help. The steady continuance of such efforts as our Fairs, has already so greatly modified pub- 
lic sentiment that Slavery is half abolished. Let us then receive your aid to complete the good 

work so well begun. 

We have made arrangements for a Refreshment-Table, and supplies for it will be the same as 
money Sugar, eggs, bottles of cream, for the ice-creams ; coffee, (roasted and ground,) tea, fruit, and 
vegetables of all kinds, poultry, alamode beef, jellies and sweetmeats, cakes, pies, bread; in short 
every thing of this kind will find a ready and profitable sale. 

Donations of whole pieces or remnants of silk, velvet, linen, cambric, lace, ribbons, cords, tassels, 
trimmings, pattern-books of such goods, children's books, and ever/ fancy or useful article, will be 

most acceptable. . .. 

Any of the friends of the cause, who are skilled in turning and cabinet-making, are informed that 
nothing would meet a more ready sale than elegant little articles of drawing-room furniture. The 
latest models of what-nots, or book-shelves, little tables, desks, screen-mountings, arm-cha.rs, &c, are 
always sought after. Models will be gladly furnished to any friends who wish to help m this way. 

Friends who can raise supplies of boots, shoes, brooms, baskets, soap, candles, agricultural pro- 
duce &c &c, are informed that all such contributions will be the same as money. We are making 
arrangements to defray the expenses of the Fair from articles remaining, not from cash received. 

Q5^ Of all the customary little articles with which our Fairs have usually abounded, such as nee- 
,dle-books, pin and toilette-cushions, caps, collars, &c„ not one remains on hand. The whole has been 
sold at the various Fairs held during the summer, and the money passed into the treasury of the So- 
ciety In addition to such articles, we need a supply of quilted skirts, aprons, (of black s.lk and 
other colors.) Ladies' and children's work-baskets, lined with silk, have been much inquired for. 
Novelty, beauty, elegance, and exquisite workmanship, are in general more likely to command a pro- 
fitable and ready sale, than costliness. Many articles, under 25 cents each, will be wanted. 

We have adopted the following regulations of former years :-To receive no goods on commission ; 
■to pay no bills but the necessary carpenter's and advertising bills out of the receipts of the Fair; (i. e. 
not to buy materials to be paid for out of the proceeds of the sales ;) to give no tickets of admission, 
with the exception of the very small number allowed to each manager. 

All our friends from the country, who intend joining in this effort, will find a warm welcome among 
us for the cause's sake; and early notice of their intention of visiting us is requested, that we maybe 
able to make the requisite arrangements for their hospitable reception.
