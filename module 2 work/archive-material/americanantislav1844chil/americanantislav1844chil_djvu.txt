What will Rum do? — It will produce knawing care, heightened by re- 
morse, and prey upon the conscience. It will yield distress both of the body 
and the mind. Every time it is used, the person will find himself less capable 
of scaring away the fiend Melancholy. All who partake deeply of intoxicat- 
ing liquors, become peevish and discontented with the world, turn enemies to 
the established order of things, and go moping and growling through a brief 
existence, blamins", instead of themselves, their neighbors, or the government, 
s the cause of their miserable condition. But this utter destruction of the 
material man is nothing in comparison with the wreck of the immortal soul. 
To see the manly soul bowed down and deformed is sufficiently shocking: 
but when the undying soul is struggling with the destroyer, delirium tre- 
mens, the scene becomes horrible beyond all power of description. 



■2. FEBRUARY. Begins on Thursday, S9 days. 1844.

Plain Questions and Plain Answers. — Why does a man swallow Rum ? 




Because it makes him happy. — How long does the happiness last ? Until the 




gassy effect is over. — How does he feefthen? Wretched enough. — Does 




Rum render him healthy ? No, it diseases. — Does it make him respectahle ? 




Far from it ; it degrades him. — Does it make him prosperous ? It impover- 




ishes him, and beggars his wife and children. — What is the end of the vic- 




tim ? Disgrace. — Where does he repose after death ? In a dishonored grave. 




What is his memory ? Infamous : his wife and little orphans, his relations, 




and mankind, speak his name in whispers ! — Will you then swallow intoxi- 




cating liquors ? Let every man's answer be, No ! I will follow in the track 




of the immortal six of Baltimore, sign the pledge, and become a comfort 




and protector to my family, and a useful and respectable member of society, 




and an example to the rising generatioa

Female Nobility. — The woman, poor and homely-clad as she may be, 
who balances her income and expenditure — who toils unrepiningly among 
her well-trained children, and presents them, morning and evening, in rosy 
health and cheerfulness, as offerings of love to her husband— ^-who seeks the 
improvement of their minds rather than the adornment of their bodies — is the 
most exalted of her sex. Before her shall the proudest dame bow her jewel- 
led head, for the bliss of a happy heart dwells with her for ever. If there 
is one prospect more dear to the soul of a man than another, it is that of 
meeting at the door his smiling wife and group of happy children. How it 
stirs up the tired blood of an exhausted man, when he hears the patter of 
many feet on the stairs — when young voices mix in glad confusion, and the 
youngest springs to his arms with a mirthful shout. Father Almighty, thy 
glory shines around the group ! Thy smile and blessing huver there !

COMPETENCE. 

A competence is vital to content ; 
Much wealth is corpulence, if not disease ; 
Sick, or encumber'd is our happiness, 
A competence is all we can enjoy. 
O be content, where heav'n can give no more t 
More, like a flash of water from a lock, 
Quickens our spirit's movement for an hour; 
But soon its force is spent, nor rise our joys 
Above our native temper's common stream. 
Hence disappointment lurks in every prize, 
As bees in flow.'rs, and stings us with success.

The rich man who denies it proudly feigns, 
Nor knows the wise are privy to the lie. 
Much learning shows how little mortals know; 
Much wealth, how little worldlings can enjoy : 
At best, it babies us with endless toys, 
And keeps us children till we drop to dust. 
As monkeys at a mirror stand amazed, 
They fail to find what they so plainly see ; 
Thus men, in shining riches, see the face 
Of happiness, nor know it is a shade, 
But gaze, and touch, and peep, and peep again. 
And wish, and wonder it is absent still.

1 In a free country there is much complaint with little suffering — in ades- 
lipotism there is much suffering and little complaint. 

Truth may be often blamed but never shamed. 

Deliberate slowly, execute promptly. 

Idleness brings forward and nourishes many bad passions. 

We must stand or fall by our own conduct and character. 

To live soberly, righteously, and piously, comprehends the whole of our 
duty. 

When thy friend is calumniated, openly and boldly espouse his cause. 

Benefits should be long and gratefully remembered. 

If the mind sow not corn, it will plant thistles* 

They who raise envy, will easily incur censure. 

Labor gives a true relish to pleasure.

Temperance is the strength of the mind, 

No man need despair of being happy. 

There is no happiness on earth exceeding that of a reciprocal satisfaction 
in a conjugal state. 

Revenge is the pleasure of a little mind. 

We connot love those whom we do not respect. 

Every braggart is a coward. 

How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is, to have a thankless child. 

The purest treasure is spotless reputation. 

We can carry nothing out of the world, but a good or bad conscience. 

Never take it for granted, that a man will do his duty because he ought 
to do it. 

Let every man be the champion of right

If a man begin a fool, he is not obliged to persevere. 






Men often attribute their hardships to the misconduct of their rulers. 






Trust women who trust not men. 






Set not public opinion at defiance. 






Modesty is the strongest defence of the heart. 






Suspicion is always worse than fact. 






Science has no enemy but ignorance. 






Truth, however bitter, does the mind 'good. 






Our best instruction is gained from our own thoughts. 






Gambling- debases the mind. 






In factions the most ignorant are alway the most violent. 






Duplicity is the resource of a coward. 






True politeness springs from the heart.

Marriage is, of all human actions, the one in which society is the most 
interested. 

Every house should have a garden as a remembrancer of Paradise, 

Never seek friendship with one who is not better than thyself. 

Never do an act of which you doubt the justice. 

Promote not an unworthy man ; it disgraces humanity. 

Happy is that people, whose rulers rule in the fear of God, 

Happy is that country, whose public men are gentlemen. 

Ask not that of another which thou would'st deny to him. 

Remember the past, consider the present, provide for the future. 

Attend seduously, question clearly, answer cooly, and cease when you 
have nothing to say, 

A flatterer is a shadow of a fool.

A Lesson for Scolding Wives. — « And I dare say you have scolded 
your wife often, Newman/' said I, one day, while sitting by his fire-side. Old 
Newman looked down, and his wife took up the reply. "Never, to signify — 
and if he has, I have deserved it." " And I dare say, if the truth was known, 
you have scolded him as often," said I. " Nay," said the old woman, with 
a beauty of kindness which all the poetry in the world cannot excel : " how 
can a wife scold her good man, who has been hard at work for her and her 
little ones all the day ? It may do for a man to be occasionally peevish and 
fretful, for it is he who must meet the crosses and disappointments of the 
world ; and who should make him forget them but his own wife, for whom 
he braves and bears so much ? And she had best for her own sake ; for no- 
body can scold to a very great extent when the talking is all done on one 
side."

Labor, industry, and virtue, go hand in hand. Idleness and leisure, lead 
to weakness, immorality, and vice. Down with all aristocracy — all no- 
bility — save the nobility of true virtue and honest industry. Toil, either of 
the brain, of the heart, or the head is the only true manhood, the only true 
nobility. 

Good sense should be the test of all rules, both ancient and modern- 
whatever is incompatible with good sense is false. 

By observing of truth, you will command esteem, as well as secure peace. 

A person may be great or rich by chance ; but cannot be wise or good, 
without taking the pains for it. 

Self-conceit, presumption, and obstinacy, blast the prospects of many a 
youth. 

The man of order catches and arrests the hours as they fly.

How few can rescue opoulence from want ! 
Who lives to nature rarely can be poor; 
Who lives to fancy never can be rich. 
Poor is the man in debt ; the man of gold, 
In debt to fortune, trembles at her power ; 
The man of reason smiles at her and death. 
O what a patrimony this ! A being 
Of such inherent strength and majesty, 
Not world's possess'd can raise it; worlds destroy'd 
Can't injure it; which holds on its glorious course, 
When thine, O Nature ! ends ; too blest to mourn 
Creation's obsequies. What treasure this! 
The monarch is a beggar to the man. 



TEXAS. 15 



TEXAS. 

This country extends from the western boundary of the State of 
Louisiana, along the Gulf of Mexico, about 400 miles, and is estimated to 
contain 160,000 square miles. But the Texan revolutionists have under- 
taken, by act of their Congress, to add to Texas proper parts of the 
departments of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Sania Fe; em- 
bracing all the Mexican territory east of the Eio Bravo, and making 
140,000 square miles more. The whole, therefore, that is commonly 
meant, when we speak of Texas, amounts to 300,000 square miles, being 
more than six times the extent of Pennsylvania, seven times that of 
New York, and forty times that of Massachusetts. 

In the year 1819, the first grant of land in Texas was made to a citi- 
zen of the United States. It was made by the royal government. 

In 1821, Mexico threw off the yoke of Spain, and became an inde- 
pendent republic. 

In 1822, the first settlement was made by Americans, under the above- 
mentioned grant. 

In 1823, Mexico made with Great Britain a treaty for the suppression 
of the slave-trade. 

In 1824, Mexico passed a law prohibiting the introduction of slaves, 
and declaring them free as soon as they reached the Mexican soil. 

In 1829, slavery was totally abolished throughout Mexico. 

The Americans were allowed extraordinary privileges. Lands of 
great extent and fertility were freely given them. They were exempted 
from taxes, and from custom-house duties on all goods imported for their 
own use, for the space of ten years. In return, they were required to 
take an oath to support the constitution, and to observe the Catholic 
religion. By taking this oath, becoming the lawful proprietors of land, 
and residing in the province six months, they become Mexican citizens. 
That the settlers should be Roman Catholics, was made an express con- 
dition of every grant of land in Texas. No settler could complain of 
being deceived. 

Received and treated with this unexampled kindness and generosity, 
the Americans immediately began to violate the laws of their benefac- 
tors. They smuggled, for the Indian and other trade, under pretence of 
importing for their own use; and they introduced slaves from the United 
States, Cuba, and Africa, without paying the slightest regard to the legal 
prohibition, and when the total extinction of slavery was finally decreed, 
they prepared to resist with force and arms the execution of the law. 

In this posture of affairs, the slave States of the Union, with the federal 
executive at their head, began to conspire and plot for the separation of 
Texas from Mexico, and its annexation to the United States. 

Two considerations, each calculated to operate powerfully upon men 
of the lawless habits and ungoverned passions, which generally charac- 
terize slaveholders, impelled them to this policy. 

1. The acquisition of Texas would enlarge and perpetuate the Ameri- 
can market for slaves ; and thus encourage and extend indefinitely the 
business of slave breeding, which is a principal source of revenue in all 
the old slave States, and which reconciles two things generally found to 
beirreconcileable, viz. : pecuniary gain and personal profligacy. Lasci- 
viousness usually empties men's pockets, under the slave-breeding system 
it fills them; for mulattoes usually bring higher prices than pure blacks. 



16 TEXAS. 



2. It would create new slave States to balance the free, which will 
be formed in the North-west; and thus preserve the numerical equipoise 
of liberty and slavery in the Senate of the United States. 

To a class of men, who, with few exceptions, are of worldly, ambi- 
tious, and sensual character, these must be*controlling motives of action. 
In point of fact, the southern slaveholders have resorted to every sort of 
means to compass their darling object. 

They offered large sums of money and urge*d exaggerated claims to 
induce Mexico to cede Texas. They encouraged the emigrants to resist 
the abolition of slavery. They organized a party, extending through 
every portion of this country, for stirring up rebellion and effect- 
ing a revolution in Texas. 

The leader, Samuel Houston, the intimate friend of General Jackson, 
went to Texas for that purpose, and gave out to his friends, to the 
disaffected, and to adventurers, that he acted in conformity with the 
views of that high magistrate. 

Enlistments and expeditions for the service of the insurgents were 
everywhere openly made and encouraged in the United States, without 
an attempt on the part of the Government to execute the law, which 
imposes a fine of $11000 and imprisonment three years, for these offences. 
At a critical period, Gen. Gaines was sent into Texas with an army, 
under pretense of restraining the hostility of Indians, but in reality to 
create an impression on the minds of the contending parties, that the 
United States, in case of need, would ultimately take part with Texas. 

They repeatedly offered vast bribes to Mexican officers to betray their 
country, and become subservient to this great scheme of slaveholding 
aggrandizement. 

While these things were going on, the warmest professions of 
friendship to Mexico were constantly made by the Executive of the 
United States. 

By such means, was the separation of Texas from Mexico effected. 
It was done by intruders from the United States, a large portion of them 
fugitives from justice, aud not at all by the legitimate and industrious 
settlers of Texas. They were opposed to the whole scheme, but were 
overborne and silenced by the calumnies, threats, intrigues, and violence 
of ruffians coming from afar, and organized for crime. It only remains 
to take the final step of attaching the province to this Union. Had it 
not been for the earnest and strenuous opposition of abolitionists, that 
would have been done before now. There is great danger that it may 
still be done. Southern statesmen, by the corrupting influences of 
slavery, by education and habit, become, as a general thing, thoroughly 
Machivellian in character and policy. They are so secret and subtle in 
management, and so unscrupulous as to means, that there is no safety 
for philanthropists and freemen in this contest, except in an ever-wake- 
ful vigilance and unwearied opposition. The greatest danger is to be 
apprehended at the first session of the 28th Congress. The private 
declarations and correspondence of slave-members at the last session, as 
well as other signs, indicated the determination to make a desperate 
and decisive effort at the assembling of a new Congress. Meantime, 
the Executive has taken care that at every possible point of contact with 
Mexico, this republic (having but a handful of slaveholders in compari- 
son with her freemen) should be represented by slaveholders only. The 
commander of every vessel belonging to our Pacifie squadron is from a 



slave State. Com. Jones, who committed the outrage in California (a 
preliminary step in the slavemongers' scheme of seizing that vast pro- 
vince), and who now, nearly a year after that misdemeanor, is still in 
command of that squadron, is a Virginian and a slaveholder. General 
Gaines, so well known for his manoeuvres on and beyond the Texan 
frontier, in 1836, is now in command on the entire Mexcan line. _ He offi- 
cially avows that he will regard no line. He, too, is a Virginian and a 
slaveholder. The Commander-in-Chief of our army, is a Virginian. 
Mr. Upshur, who, as Secretary of the Navy, gave Jones his orders, and 
has encouraged American emigration to California, and directed its har- 
bors to be surveyed, and who is in the habit of declaring with oaths that 
" we must and will have Texas," is a Virginian, a slaveholder, and pro- 
bably si slave-breeder. Henry A. Wise, a man of decided influence with 
the present Cabinet, is from the same spot; the Old Eastern shore of 
Virginia, the hot-bed of slavery." President Tyler is from the same dis- 
trict. He is one of that numerous class of Virginia slaveholders, who 
has long ceased to reap from his barren acres any crop except " the vigin- 
tial ;"■* a crop flourishing only in moral decay and degradation. We 
have no doubt that each of these individuals, whose slightest action now 
affects the destinies of the country, considers the fortunes of himself , his 
family, and his State, to depend on the annexation of Texas as a slave 
market and as material for slave Stales. 

Let us then be up and doing! Let Memorials against the annexa- 
tion of Texas flood the Capitol ! Representatives and Senators may 
spurn them, but they will not dare to disregard them. Let us not rely 
on foreign aid. It is true that British abolitionists are aroused to a sense 
of the vast importance of this subject ; but they must depend upon us to give 
them information and warning. The responsibility of American aboli- 
tionists is therefore not divided, though their strength is doubled. Let 
them be vigilant and faithful, for the enemy is cunning and powerful. 



A GENEROUS OFFER. 

Tom and Esau, two slaves of Samuel Houston, President of Texas, 
ran away, and got safely into Mexico. Tom wrote his master from 
Matamoras, that if he was out of funds, he would send him some. 



MUNROE EDWARDS' SLAVES. 

This notorious individual is the owner of a considerable number of 
slaves in Texas. He got trusted in Havana, for a cargo of 100, sold part 
of them in Texas, and the rest are now let out for his benefit, at fifteen 
or twenty dollars a month, Texan currency. The Spanish dealers are 
waiting for Munroe to pay ! 



A TEXAN'S BAGGAGE. 

Case of pistols, bowie knife, and a pack of cards. This is a Texan 
proverb. 

* This term, meaning a twenty years' crop, was first used in the Legisla- 
ture of Virginia. It is applied only to a crop of human beings.

emancipation in the British West Indies, Look out for his paragraphs.

CASSIUS M. CLAY. 



This gentleman is entitled, as much perhaps as any one living, to the 
respect and admiration of the friends of freedom and humanity. In the 
midst of slavery and the menaces and violence of its mobs, and the cold- 
ness of its more prudent and more heartless supporters, Mr. Clay has 
fearlessly and nobly borne a true testimony against the iniquity of 
slavery and the slave-trade. He is said to be a nephew of Henry Clay, 
and one of the wealthiest men in Kentucky. Long may he live to apply 
his ample powers of doing good to so worthy and patriotic a purpose. 
At the late election in Kentucky, a desperate attempt was made to 
assassinate him. Although the immediate occasion was a political dis- 
pute at the hustings, there seems to be no doubt that the attempt was 
the result of a conspiracy to kill him, on account of his eloquent writings, 
speeches, and legislative efforts against slavery. Mr. Clay received 
a pistol ball in his bosom, which was arrested by striking the sheath of 
his bowie knife. 



20 CONCISE ANSWERS. 



CONCISE ANSWERS. 

Pro. I object to the harsh language of abolitionists* I approve of the 
old maxim, that " honey catches more flies than vinegar." 

Anti. The maxim is very true; and we leave it to those whose busi- 
ness it is to catch flies. If a man should seize your wife and sell her, or 
keep her for himself, as best suited his convenience; if he compelled 
you, year after year, to unrequited toil; if you saw your children bleeding 
under his lash, and knew that the law allowed him to kill them, provided 
it was done by "moderate correction;" how much honey should you 
think necessary to caich that fly? 

Pro. Show me the plan of the abolitionists. 

Anti. We intend to do our work as Paul did, by the " foolishness of 
preaching." 

Pro* The slaves must be fitted for freedom, before they are emanci- 
pated. 

Anti. That can never be done while they are slaves. Your proposition 
reminds me of the careful mother, who said her son should never go into 
the water, till he had learned to swim ; so she made him dive off the 
bureau, and he broke his nose. 

Pro. What do you talk to us at the North for ? 

Anti. Because the South could not sustain slavery without our con- 
tinual aid ; and this she acknowledges. Because when public opinion is 
right at the North, the South cannot possibly withstand it. 

An Irishman once went to a shop to buy one spur. " Why do you ask 
for one ?" said the shopman ; they are always sold in pairs." " Where's 
the use?" inquired Patrick: "And sure if 1 make one side of the horse 
gallop, won't the other gallop too?" 

Pro. The coloured and white race can never live together on equal 
terms ; there is an instinctive antipathy between them ; they won't mix 
any better than oil and water." 

Anti. Take a census of colored complexions, the mulattoes, quadroons, 
&c, and then tell me what you think of oil and water. 

Pro. But this plan of social equality is so dangerous. It will disor- 
ganize society. Give these blackies a good education, make lawyers 
and merchants of them, and the next thing we shall know, they'll be 
marrying our daughters. 

Anti. I thought you said just now that there was such an instinctive 
antipathy, they wouldn't mix any better than oil and water? 

Pro. The time hasn't come yet to agitate this question. 

Anti. To such a remark, Angelina Grimke once replied, " If thou wert 
a slave, toiling in the fields of Carolina, I apprehend" thou wouldst think 
the time had fully come." 

Pro. You are not aware of the danger involved in this discussion. I 
beg of you to remember the women of the South with their infants in 
their arms. 

Anti. I do remember the women of the South, with their infants in 
their arms ; but I remember them without regard to color. 

Pro. You do not realize what a horrible thing it would be to let the 
slaves loose upon their masters. 

Anti. Did it ever occur to you that the masters have always been let 
loose upon the slaves ? This has been literally true ; for they make all 
the laws, without allowing the colored man the slightest voice in them. 



GEORGE LATIMER. 21 



• Pro. The masters deserve pity rather than blame. Many of them 
would emancipate, if they could; but they cannot ; the laws forbid it. 

Anti. Who made the laws? Who sustains the laws? You forget 
that the people are the sovereign power in this country ; and these slave- 
holders are themselves the people. Your plea reminds me of the little 
girl- who told her mother she could not do the work she had been ordered, 
because she was tied. " Who tied you?" " I tied myself." 



GEORGE LATIMER. 

The hegira of George Latimer forms an epoch in the anti-slavery 
annals. He fled from " the happiness" of being a slave in Norfolk, Vir- 
ginia. His master, James B. Gray, pursued and arrested him at Bos- 
ton, on a charge of theft ; but this bejjjg found unsustainable, he was 
detained and committed to Suffolk jail, on the simple order of Gray, as 
a slave. Various judicial proceedings and delays took place, in which a 
deep and daily increasing interest on the part of the people was mani- 
fested. An immense meeting took place at Faneuil Hall, and very full 
and excited meetings in the neighboring towns. From the spirit and 
resolutions of those meetings, it became apparent that Latimer could 
never be removed from Massachusetts as a slave. The sheriff of Suf- 
folk, alarmed by the general indignation at the perversion of the power 
and the prisons of Massachusetts to the detention of a victim of kidnap- 
ping, gave orders to the deputy and jailor to discharge the prisoner. 
When he was on the point of doing so, Gray's attorney executed a deed 
of manumission in favor of Latimer, in consideration of $400 paid him 
by a citizen of Boston. Gray had previously demanded $800. 

The case, however, did not end here. A petition, signed by 60,000 
citizens, was presented to the Legislature of Massachusetts ; and, in 
consequence thereof, an act passed for " the protection of personal liberty." 
By this act, all judges, justices of the peace, and officers of the common- 
wealth, are forbidden, under heavy penalties, to aid, or act in any man- 
ner, in the arrest, detention, or delivery of any person claimed as a fugi- 
tive slave. 

A petition signed by nearly an equal number, praying that Massachu- 
setts may be exempted from any part in the maintenance of slavery, and 
relieved from all connection with it, was forwarded to Washington. 
After repeated attempts of John Quincy Adams to present it to" the 
House, it was at last silently given over to the Speaker, under a rule of 
the House, and was by him referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, 
with whom it remained at the close of the session ; Mr. Barnard, the 
chairman, having been unable to assemble a quorum of the Committee 
for the purpose of considering it. 

The case of Somerset is famous, as the first in which it was decided 
that a slave cannot by law exist on Old England's ground; that of Lati- 
mer will be equally famous, as the first in which it was decided that a 
slave shall not exist on New England's ground, whether there be law for 
it or not. We have been quibbling too long on laws which consign 
innocent men to a fate worse than death.

22 THE EAST INDIES. 



THE EAST INDIES. 

The Governor General of India, in Council, passed the following Act 
for the Abolition of Slavery in the British Settlements of the East: 

" Whereas in certain parts of the Straits' settlements, slavery has 
never had any legal existence, and in the other parts in which it is doubtful 
whether formerly it had such legal existence it is no longer warranted 
by custom, or the supposed rights connected therewith have been ex- 
pressly abandoned : 

" It is hereby declared and enacted, that in no parts of the Straits' set- 
tlements shall the status of slavery be recognised as ; existing by law. 
And all courts and officers of law are hereby prohibited from enforcing 
any claims founded on any supposed rights of masters in regard to slaves 
within the settlements aforesaid, and are enjoined to afford protection to 
all persons against whom any supposed rights of slavery are attempted 
to be enforced." 

This act was for some time understood in the United States to abolish 
slavery throughout British India ; but in point of fact it extended only to 
Malacca, Singapore, Penang or Prince of Wales' Island, and Province 
Wellesley. It freed about 10,000 slaves. 

Subsequently, on the 7th of April, 1843, the East India Directors, and 
the Gov. Gen. and Council of India, passed an act which has become 
law, whereby 10,000,000 of slaves were set free. The following is a copy : 

" An Act for declaring and amending the law regarding the condition 
of slavery within the territories of the East India Company. 

" 1. It is hereby enacted and declared, that no public officer shall, in 
execution of any decree or order of court, or for the enforcement of any 
demand of rent or revenue, sell, or cause to be sold, any person, or the 
right to the compulsory labor or services of any person, on the ground 
that such person is in a state of slavery. 

" 2. And it is hereby declared and enacted, that no rights arising out 
of an alleged property in the person and services of another, as a slave, 
shall be enforced by any civil or criminal court or magistrate, within the 
territories of the East India Company. 

" 3. And it is hereby declared and enacted, that no person who may 
have acquired property by his own industry, or by the exercise of any 
calling, art, or profession, or by inheritance, assignment, gift or bequest, 
shall be dispossessed of such property, or prevented from taking posses- 
sion thereof, on the ground that such person, or that the person, from 
whom the property may have been derived, was a slave. 

" 4. And it is hereby enacted, that any Act which would be a penal 
offence if done to a free man, shall be equally an offence if done to any 
person on the pretext of his being in a condition of slavery." 

By this last act slavery is legally abolished throughout British India. 

In Ceylon, a colony of the Crown, slavery expired on the 31st of Dec, 
1842; and 30,000 slaves found themselves changed into freemen on the 
1st of January, 1843. 

All the British laws against slavery and the slave-trade have been 
extended to Scinde, a couniry on the Indus, lately acquired by the British. 

If these laws are faithfully executed, slavery is extinct in the whole of 
British India. So the advocates of slavery can no longer comfort them- 
selves with the wickedness of Great Britain. Alas ! where will they 
look for refuge or example? 



A KENTUCKY ABOLITIONIST. — COLONIZATION SOCIETY. 23 

A KENTUCKY ABOLITIONIST. 

[From the Louisville, Ky., Advertiser.'} 

"Mr. Thomasson, we understand, in his speech on Tuesday evening, 
again avowed his anti-slavery sentiments, and repelled, with scorn, any 
concealment of them. He even goes a step farther than we believed 
(reckless as he is,) he would dare to do before any enlightened commu- 
nity of slaveholders in the country. He stated, we are credibly informed, 
that at the time of the exciting agitation of the Missouri Question, he 
was opposed, on constitutional grounds, to her admission to the Union, 
and still condemns the policy and constitutionality of her reception into 
the confederacy. He continues to allege his unequivocal hostility to the 
admission of Texas among our sovereignties, with the stigma of slavery 
on her escutcheon — and in fine is about as thorough an Abolitionist in 
theory, as can be found outside of the liberator office, or the world's 
convention. If he isn't a pretty tea-pot for a Representative in Con- 
gress from Old Kentucky, we are no democrat." 

The man thus denounced was nevertheless elected ; and is now one of 
the Representatives of Kentucky in the Congress of the United States. 
Honor for his noble independence, and true bravery, and large-hearted- 
ness ! Honor to the people who appreciated and stood by him. While 
there is one such man in the republic, we will not despair of it. 

Be noble ! and the nobleness that lies 
In other men, sleeping, but never dead, 
Will rise in majesty to meet thine own. 



COLONIZATION SOCIETY. 

The Colonization Society was organized Jan. 1. 1817, and has there- 
fore been in existence a little over 26 years. This plan originated at 
the South, and was occasioned by several attempts at insurrection by 
the slaves, about the year 1800, and afterwards. The legislature of Vir- 
ginia, at its sessions in 1800, 1802 and 1805, passed resolutions urging 
Congress to purchase some territory out of the limits of the United States, 
on which to colonize free persons of color, and slaves that might be 
emancipated for that purpose, and those who should " be dangerous to 
the public safety." It was not until after the formation of the Society 
that anything was said about its being the means of abolishing slavery, 
or of christianizing Africa. It was first got up by the slaveholders of 
the South, to remove the free negroes who were thought to be danger- 
ous to the perpetuity of slavery ; an appeal was then made to the anti- 
slavery and religious feeling of the North, that they might receive aid 
from that quarter in accomplishing their purposes. A delusion of this 
kind would also serve to quiet the sensitiveness of the North, and allay 
the anti-slavery feeling that has always existed there — a very important 
requisite for the continuance of slavery. This is a fair representation of 
the manner in which the spirit of slavery has deluded the North in all 
the questions that relate to its own support. The double-dealing of 
that system of iniquity is yet too little understood.

To the above amount of expenses should be added $130,000 received

sum total of the expenses of the Society, $732,840 39. From the 
whole number of emigrants should be deducted 300 recaptured Africans, 
which would leave 3704 free blacks and emancipated slaves, the Society 
has colonized at Liberia in twenty-three years, being an average of 168 
a year. 

The colony is composed of four principal settlements, viz., Monrovia, 
Bassa Cove, Greenville, and Maryland. The territory is about 300 
miles in length, and from 10 to 40 miles in width. 

The number of persons sent to Liberia by this Society each year has 
been less than the average increase of slaves every day. How absurd it 
is, then, to present the colonization scheme as. a remedy for slavery ! 
Ten times the number of slaves colonize themselves in Canada every 
year, at little or no expense whatever. 



THE BIBLE SOCIETY. 

The statistics of this Society mention various grants of money, &c, to 
foreign societies and nations for the diffusion of the Scriptures, viz. : for 
the Hebrew Spanish Old Testament, $7,000; for Madras, $6,000; Sand- 
wich Islands, $5,500; Ceylon, $4,000; Madeira, $2,000; Russia and 
Finland, $1,000 ; Northern India, $1,000, &c. A donation has been made, 
also, " to print some of the gospels in the Jubo tongue, on the coast of 
Africa." But I do not perceive any account of Bibles or Testaments 
distributed amongst the millions of our oivn slaves. 

Would the Christians of the South lynch the Society, if it dared to 
attend to heathen at home ? 



JOHN QTJINCY ADAMS. 25 



JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. 

Extract from his letter in reply to a invitation to deliver an address at 
Bangor, Maine, on the 1st of August, 1843. 

How can we presume to share in the festivities and unite in the songs 
of triumph of the first of August ? Have we emancipated our slaves ? 
Have we mulcted ourselves in a hundred millions of dollars to persuade 
and prevail upon the man stealer to relinquish his grasp upon his preyt 
Have we encompassed sea and land and sounded the clarion of freedom 
to the four winds of heaven to break the chain of slavery in the four 
quarters of the earth ? Has the unction of our eloquence moved the 
J bowels of compassion of the Holy Pontiff of the Roman Catholic church, 
to issue his commands to his christian flock against slavery and the slave 
trade ? Have we softened the heart of the fiery Mussleman of Tunis, the 
follower of the war denouncing prophet of Mecca to proclaim liberty 
throughout his land ? Are we carrying into Hindostan, the inexpressible 
blessings of emancipation ? Are we bursting open the everlasting gates 
and overleaping the wall of China to introduce into that benighted 
empire in one concentrated sunbeam the light of civil and of christian 
Liberty? Oh no, my countrymen ! No! Nothing of all this ! Instead 
of all this, are we not suffering our own hands to be manacled and our 
own feet to be fettered with the chains of slavery ? Is it not enough to 
be told that by a fraudulent perversion of language in the constitution oi 
the United States we have falsified the constitution itself, by admitting 
into boih the Legislative and Executive Departments of the Government 
an overwhelming representation of one species of property to the exclu- 
sion of all others, and that the odious property in slaves? Is it not 
enough that by this exclusive privilege of property representation, 
confined to one section of the country, an irresistible ascendency in the 
action of the general Government has been secured not indeed to that 
section, but to an oligarchy of slaveholders in that section, and to the 
cruel oppression of the poor in that same section itself? Is it not enough 
that by the operation of this radical iniquity in the organization of the 
government, an immense disproportion of all offices from the highest to 
the lowest, civil, military, naval, executive and judicial, are held by 
slaveholders? Have we not seen the sacred right of petiuon'totally 
suppressed ? Have we not seen for the last twenty years the constitution 
and solemn treaties with foreign nations trampled on by cruel oppression 
and lawless imprisonment of colored mariners in the Southern States, 
in cold blooded defiance of a solemn adjudication by a southern judge in 
the Circuit Court of the Union ? And is this not enough ? Have not 
the people of the free States been required to renounce for their own 
citizens the rights of Habeas Corpus and trial by jury, and to coerce that 
base surrender of the only praciical security to all personal rights? 
Have not the slave breeders by State Legislation subjected to fine and 
imprisonment the citizens of the free States for merely coming within 
their jurisdiction ? Have we not tamely submitted for years to the 
daily violation of the freedom of the Post Office and of the Press by a 
committee of seal breakers; and have we not seen a sworn Post Master 
General formally avow that thousb he could not license this cut-purse 
protection of the peculiar institutions, the perpetrators of this highway 
robbery must justify themselves by the plea of necessity? And. has the i 

pillory or the penitentiary been the reward of that Post Master General? i

motion of human freedom levelled wilh the dust, and consumed by fire, 
and wanton, unprovoked murder perpetrated with impunity by "slave 
mongers? Have we not witnessed human beings, men made in the 
likeness of God, and endowed with immorlal souls, burnt at the stake, 
not for their offences but for their color? Are not the journals of our 
Senate disgraced by resolutions calling for War to indemnify the slave 
pirates of the Enterprise and the Creole for the self-emancipation of their 
slaves, and to inflict vengeance by a death of torture upon the heroic 
self-deliverance of Madison Washington ? Have we not been fifteen 
years plotting rebellion against our neighbor Republic of Mexico for 
abolishing slavery throughout all her Provinces? Have we not aided 
and abetted one of her provinces in insurrection against her for that 
cause ? And have we not invaded openly, and sword in hand another 
of her provinces, and all to effect her dismemberment, and to add ten 
more slave States to our Confederacy ? Has the cry of war for the con- 
quest of Mexico, for the expansion of re-instituted slavery, for the robbery 
of Priests and the plunder of religious esiabiishments yet subsided ? 
Have the pettifogging, hair-splitting, nonsensical and yet inflammatory 
bickerings about the right of search, pandering to the thirst for revenge 
in France, panting for war to prostrate the disputed title of her King, — 
has the sound of this war trumpet yet faded away upon our ears ? 

Has the supreme and unparalleled absurdity of stipulating by treaty 
to keep a squadron of eighty guns for five years without intermission 
upon the coast of Africa, to suppress the African slave trade, and at the 
same time denying at the point of the bayonet the right of that squadron 
to board or examine any slaver all but sinking under a cargo of victims, 
if she but hoist a foreign flag — has this diplomatic bone been yet picked 
clean ? Or is our indirect participation in the African slave trade to be 
protected at whatever expense of blood or treasure ? Is the Supreme 
Executive Chief of this Commonwealth, yet to speak not for himself, 
but for her whole people, and pledge them to shoulder their muskets 
and endorse their knapsacks against the fanatical non-resistant aboli- 
tionists, whenever the overseers may please to raise the bloody flag with 
the swindling watch- word of the Union ? Oh, my friends! I have not 
the heart to join in the festivity on the first of August, the British anni- 
versary of disenthralled humanity, while all this and infinitely more than 
I could tell, but that I would spare the blushes of my country, weighs 
down my spirits, with the uncertainty, sinking into my grave as I am, 
whether she is doomed to be numbered among the first liberators> or the 
| last oppressors of the race of immortal man. 



THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO SLAVES. 

Frederic Douglass, the eloquent fugitive slave, sometimes mimics the 
preaching he heard while in bondage. lie tells of a preacher, who 
called the attention of his slave hearers to the wonderful adaptation of 
things to their appropriate use, as manifested in the Creator's works. — 
" The white man," said he, " has a soft and slender hand ; but you, who 
are made to laoor for him, have large and horny hands, that enable you 
to do his work." The poor ignorant creatures had had no opportunity 
to learn that cessation from labor would make their hands likewise soft ; 
and some of them went home, saying, " What a nice preacher that was ! 



THE POST OFFICE. BEASTS OF BURDEN. 27 

Every word he spoke was true. — How kind it was of God to make our 
hands so hard ! How they would blister, if they were as soft as the 
white man's." 

Another story he tells is of a Methodist class leader, who tied up a 
slave woman, and flogged her till the blood streamed down her back j 
and when he had finished his brutal task, he quoted to her the text, 
" He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten 
with many stripes." 

THE POST OFFICE. 

D. L. Child, in one of his letters from Washington, says he has heard 
it stated, he knows not how truly, that at the South newspapers go by 
mail, postage free. The following from the Lowell Journal, it will be 
seen, confirms the statement by southern testimony. 

"Southern Postage. — Did you know that south of the Potomac, the 
people never pay a cent of postage on newspapers? Mr. Sevier, of 
Arkansas, said in the Senate, when the Post Office bill was under con- 
sideration, that the Southern people would not put up with a postmaster 
who vjould attempt to make them pay postage on newspapers." 

So here is another mode of picking Northern pockets for the slave- 
holders' benefit. The North, as official documents of the Post Office 
Department show, pays in postage much more than the whole cost of Mail 
transportation within her own bounds; while the South falls vastly short 
of paying the expense in hers. It is vastly convenient, no doubt, to be 
above the littleness of dealing in paltry coppers, like a Yankee pedlar, 
when the alternative is to pay a cent or pay nothing. But if the charge 
of postage on papers at the North is a just one; if so much money be 
longs of right to the Post Office Department, for so much service ren-" 
dered, what better than systematic theft — on a small scale it is true — is 
the refusal to pay the price while receiving the service. 

Voice of Freedom. 



BEASTS OF BURDEN. 

A gentleman from South Carolina once said to me, " I reallv pity you 
northern women. 'As I walked home from church yesterday, I heard one 
lady say to another, ' I want you to dine with me to-morrow ; that is, if 
all my servants don't take it into their heads to go off before that time.' 
I thought to myself, how I would make the southern ladies laugh by 
repeating this remark. Our slaves would consider it a hard exchange to 
become New England house-keepers. Professor Dew said rightly, ' The 
women of the North are mere beasts of burden.' " 

I did not enter into a prolonged argument. Under the influence of 
alarmed self-interest and strongly excited prejudice, the man was saying 
much that he knew to be untrue. 

I told him so, with as much courtesy as possible ; and quietly remarked, 
"I, for one, consider it more respectable, and more comfortable, to be a 
Beast of Burden than a Beast of Prey."

28 RAILROAD INCIDENT. — MOHAMMEDAN EXAMPLE. 

A RAILROAD INCIDENT IN WASHINGTON, D. CT 

A few mornings since, about half past five o'clock, I went to the depot 
in this city, to leave my letters lor the North. While standing in the 
ticket office, a neat dressed young man, in the blue coat of a sailor, and 
with a frank, manly countenance, entered the office, and laid down his 
money for a ticket to Baltimore. 

"Have you got your free papers?" said Mr. Stetinius, the master of 
the depot, if that be his proper title, 

" Papers ! yes, to be sure !" and the tar pulled out his honorable dis- 
charge from the naval service of the United States, dated a few days 
before. 

"That won't do," said the ticket sellet, in imperious tones, " you 
must have a magistrate's certificate that you are free." 

" Free ! why I always was, and it's only a few days, as you may see, 
since I was discharged from the Navy Yard at New York." 

" No matter : you must go and get your pass." 

" But I must be in New York to-night. It's now almost time to start, 
and what shall I do, if I can't find a magistrate ?" 

" Why, you can't go to Baltimore, that's all." 

The poor fellow turned away with an indignant countenance, to go a 
mile to hunt up a sleepy justice to endorse his papers. 

What was the matter? does the reader ask. That sailor was not 
quite so white as the bronzed ticket seller ! 

" They are not so careful about those who are going South," said a 
laboring white man, who looked on, with a flowing eye. 

This is only one little instance of the petty despotism exercised upon 
free men, free sailors too, in the Capital of their own free government. 

May 17th, 1842. 



A MOHAMMEDAN EXAMPLE. 

The Bey of Tunis has abolished slavery in his dominions. He first 
began in April, 1841, to prohibit the importation of slaves into Barbary, 
by sea; his next move was to -declare the slave market illegal, and 
finally to raze it to the ground. He subsequently issued a decree forbid- 
ding the introduction of men of color, from the interior, under any pre- 
text, and any negro so introduced, to be free. His last proclamation has 
-declared all negroes born since the 8th of December, 1842, shall not 
only be free, but have all the rights and privileges of the most favored 
Mussulman. 



Patriots of .the Olden Time. — The wife of Samuel Adams, of revo- 
lutionary celebrity, one day informed her husband that a friend had 
made her a present of a female slave. Mr. Adams replied, in a very de- 
cided manner, "She may come, but not as a slave; for a slave cannot 
breathe in my house. If she comes, she must come free." The woman 
took up her abode with rhe family of this champion of liberty ; and there 
she li rr ed free and died free.

WEATHER WISDOM. EFFECTS OF EMANCIPATION, ETC. 29 

Weather Wisdom. — The following are a few of the common or 
popular proverbial " saws" relative to the weather, viz. — "A rainbow in 
the morning gives warning." That is, if the wind be easterly; because 
it shows that the rain cloud is approaching the observer. "A rainbow 
at night gives delight." This adage may also be a good sign, provided 
the wind be westerly, as it shows that the rain clouds are passing away. 
" Evening red and next morning grey, are certain signs of a beautiful 
day." " When the glow worm lights her lamp, the air is always damp." 
" If the cock goes crowing to bed he'll certainly rise with a watery head." 
"When you see gossamer flying, be ye sure the air is drying." " When 
black snails cross your path, black cloud much moisture hath." 
,; When the peacock loudly bawls, soon we'll have both rain and squalls." 
" If the moon shows like a silver shield, be not afraid to reap your field ; 
but if she rises haloed round, soon we'll tread on deluged ground." 
" When rooks fly sporting high in air, it shows that windy storms are 
near." If at sun rising or setting, the clouds appear of a lurid red color, 
extending nearly to the zenith, it is a sure sign of storms and gales of wind. 

Effcts of Emancipation. — A Quaker friend of ours, who recently 
travelled extensively in the Island of Jamaica, and other British West 
India Islands, with a view to learn from his own observation, the prac- 
tical workings of the new system, came to the following conclusions: 

1. Wherever the emancipated negroes are fairly, kindly, and wisely 
treated, there they are working well on the properties of their old mas- 
ters, and the existing instances of a contrary description must be 
ascribed to causes which class under slavery, arid not under freedom. 

2. An increased quantity of work thrown upon the market, is, of 
course, followed by the cheapening of labor. 

3. Real property has risen and is rising in value. 

4. The personal comforts of the laboring population, under freedom, 
are multiplied tenfold. 

5. Lastly, the moral and religious improvement of the negroes, under 
freedom, is more than equal to the increase of their comforts. For, in 
the first place, there has been a rapid increase and vast extent of ele- 
mentary and Christian education, schools for infants, young persons and 
adults, multiplying in every direction; and secondly, the gradual but 
decided diminution of crime, amounting in many country districts almost 
to its extinction ; and thirdly, the happy change of the general and 
almost universal practice of concubinage* for the equally general adop- 
tion of marriage. — Journal of Commerce. 

A good illustration. — At a temperance meeting in Western New 
York, some one alluded to the plea so often urged by the Society of 
Friends, that it is not well to aid in the reformatory movements of the 
day, because it leads to "mixing with the world." The speaker was 
followed by Henry Col man, of agricultural celebrity. In the midst of 
his remarks, he stopped suddenly, pointed out of the window, and look- 
ing at a Friend opposite to him, exclaimed in a tone of alarm, " Dr. 
Robinson ! is that your house that's on fire ?" Instantly the whole'au- 
dience were on their feet. "Stop! stop!" shouted he: "Nobody must j 
go but the Quakers. Don't mix with the world ! Nobody must go but I 
Quakers." The fire was, of course, a hoax; but we trust a serious use | 
will be made of its witty application.

30 ADROIT MANAGEMENT. WITHERING REBUKE. 

ADROIT MANAGEMENT. 

About twenty slaves in the State of Maryland lately took it into their 
heads to make a push for Canada. They met together in a common 
band, in Baltimore county. They proceeded as far as the bridge at Havre 
de Grace, where they sent two of their number forward, to make the 
experiment of crossing. The gaie keeper refused to let them pass. The 
couple then returned to their companions; when after some consultation, 
they built a coffin of rough boards, put it on a bier and placed one of 
their number on it. Then in a solemn funeral procession they marched 
up to the bridge, and asked the privilege of crossing to bury their friend 
on the other side. The ruse took. The procession crossed over, and 
kept on the highway, till they got out o£ sight; they then took to the 
woods again, and resurrected their dead companion. So says a fugitive, 
who saw several of them in Philadelphia, 



A WITHERING REBUKE. 

It is well known that Liverpool was formerly very largely engaged in 
the Slave Trade. An extensive block of stores on the quay, erected by 
merchants engaged inthat trade, took the name of the " Goree Piazza," 
which they still retain. George Frederick Cooee, the great Tragedian, 
who came on the stage in 1779, to play Richard the Third, after having 
knelt too devoutly at the shrine of Bacchus, was loudly hissed, but after 
resolute efforts to hiss and pelt him off, finally obtained a hearing, and 
addressed the audience as follows: 

" It is hard enough to submit to the degradation of such a profession 
as that in which I appear; but it is the lowest depth of disgrace to be 
compelled to play the buffoon for the amusement of a set of wretches, 
every stone of whose streets, every brick of whose houses, every block 
of whose docks, is grouted and cemented by the blood and marrow of 
the stolen and murdered African." 

It is added, that the indignant and withering rebuke of a drunken play- 
actor was more effective, in arousing the shame or stinging the con- 
science of the Liverpool African merchants, than the appeals of Clark- 
son or Wilberforce. 

J. Q. ADAMS. 

Last summer, the "old man eloquent" visited Saratoga Springs. 
Everywhere, the people came in crowds to see and honor him. A cap- 
tain of one of the steamboats on the Lakes, after listening to a thrilling 
speech from the veteran statesman, exclaimed, " By Jupiter, I wish we 
could take the engine out of that old ship and put it into a new hull !" 



THEY ARE A STUPID RACE. 

Of the many cunning contrivances to escape from slavery, we think 
the following is about the most shrewd we have heard yet. Two slaves 
in a certain county of Virginia, ran away with one of their master's 
horses. They started very early in the morning, in the following fashion : 
One of the slaves fastened a strong rope round the other's body, tied him 
to the saddle, and drove off. When met and questioned, the rider 
answered, " That black rascal undertook to run away from massa. I've 
caught him, and am taking him home, quick step. I guess he won't be

for running away again in a hurry, after massa's had the cooking of him." 
This failed not to elicit warm approbation, accompanied with hospitable 
offers of refreshment for himself and his horse. 

When arrived at a convenient place, the slaves exchanged places ; the 
rider submitting to the rope in his turn, while the other performed his 
part to admiration ; and, like him, received assistance and praise for his 
honest zeal in his master's service. 

Thus they journeyed " in tye," till they reached Pennsylvania, when 
the rope was no longer necessary. Thence they passed over into Canada. 



WORDS OF JOHN WESLEY. 

The slaveholder rests the strength of his cause on" necessity, If slavery 
is not quite right, yet it must be, because there is an absolute necessity 
for it. It is necessary we should procure slaves; and when we have 
procured them, it is necessary to" use them with severity, considering 
their stupidity, stubborness, and wickedness. 

" I answer, You stumble at the threshold ; I deny that villainy is ever 
necessary. It is impossible that it should ever be necessary, for any 
reasonable creature to violate all the laws of justice, mercy, and truth. 
No circumstances can make it necessary for a man to burst in sunder all 
the ties of humanity. It can never be necessary for a rational being to 
sink himself below a brute. A man can be under no necessity of degrad- 
ing himself into a wolf. The absurdity of the supposition is so glaring, 
that one would wonder any one could help seeing it." 



PROGRESS. 
Seven years ago, it was extremely difficult to get an article on slavery 
imo any paper, except the few supported by anti-slavery socieiies ; now 
columns on this subject may be found every week, in two-thirds of the 
newspapers throughout the land. 



HYMN. 

BY JOHN PIERPONT. 

We ask not that the slave should lie, 
As lies his master, at his ease, 

Beneath a silken canopy, 

Or in the shade of blooming trees. 

We mourn not that the man should toil ; 

'Tis nature's need, — 'tis God's decree ; 
But let the hand that tills the soil, 

Be, like the wind that fans it, free. 

We ask not " eye for eye," that all, 
Who forge the chain and ply the whip, 

Should feel their torture ; while the thrall 
Should wield the scourge of mastership. 

We only ask, O God, that they 
Who bind a brother, may relent ; 

But, Great Avenger, we do pray 
That the wrong doer may repent.

THE WITNESSES. MISSIONARY HYMN. 



THE WITNESSES.— by prof, longfellow. 



In Ocean's wide domains, 
Half buried in the sands, 

Lie skeletons in chains, 

With shackled feet and hands. 

Beyond the fall of dews, 
Deeper than plummet lies, 

Float ships with all their crews, 
No more to sink or rise. 

There the black slave-ship swims, 
Freighted with human forms, 

Whose fettered fleshless limbs, 
Are not the sport of storms. 

These are the bones of Slaves;' 
They gleam from the abyss ; 

They cry from yawning waves, 
f We are the witnesses !' 



Within Earth's wide domains 
Are markets for men's lives ; 

Their necks are galled with chains, 
Their wrists are cramped with gyves. 

Dead bodies, that the kite 

In deserts makes its prey ; 
Murders, that with affright 

Scare schoolboys from their play ! 

All evil thoughts and deeds, 
Anger, and lust, and pride ; 

The foulest, rankest weeds, 

That choke Life's groaning tide ! 

These are the woes of slaves; 

They glare from the abyss ; 
They cry from unknown graves, 

' We are the Witnesses !' 



MISSIONARY HYMN, FOR THE SOUTH. 



' Spread far the gospel tidings !' 
Call ocean, earth, and air, 

To aid your ceaseless labor 
To spread them everywhere, 

Save in the bondman's cabin — 
Let them not enter there f 

Send Bibles to the heathen ! 

On ev'ry distant shore, 
From light that's beaming o'er us, 

Let streams unceasing pour ; — 
But keep it from the millions, 

Down trodden at our door ! 

Send Bibles to the heathen, 

Their famish'd spirits feed ! 
Oh ! haste, and join your efforts, 



The priceless gift to speed ! 
Then flog the trembling bondman, 
If he shall learn to read ! 

Let love of filthy lucre 

Not in your bosoms dwell ; 

Your money, on our mission, 
Will be expended well ; — 

And then, to fill your coffers, 
Husbands and fathers sell! 

Have even little children 
All they can gain to save, . 

For teachers of the heathen, 
Beyond the ocean wave ; 

Then give to fire and faggot, 

Him who would teach your slave ! 



THE LORD'S FREEMAN. 

George Lewis, a fugitive slave, on his way to Canada, was asked 
whether he did not wish to wreak vengeance on his master for his cru- 
elties before he left. He replied, " Oh no, I would not injure a hair of 
his head, if I had the power. He has a wife and four children, and they 
love him and think a great deal of him, and it would not be right for 
me to injure so many to gratify the revenge of one." • 



AN EXAMPLE FOR STATESMEN. 

Franklin's last public act was the presentation of a Memorial to the 
House of Representatives of the United States, praying them to exert 
the full extent of the powers vested in them by the Constitution, to put 
an end to slavery. 



THE CHURCH IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. PENITENT BOY. 33 

THE CHURCH IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. 

If the light be turned to darkness, how great is that darkness ! 
The Baptist Alabama Association lately resolved that they had read their 
Bibles, and were fully convinced, that " Slavery is in accordance with its 
holy dictates." 

Of all the arts sasacious dupes invent, 
To cheat themselves, and gain a world's assent, 
The worst is — Scripture warped from its intpnt. 
Thus men go wrong with an ingenious skill ; 
Bend the straight rule to their own crooked will ; 
And with a clear and shining lamp supplied, 
First put it out, then take it for a guide. — Cowper. ' 
Elder John Peck, a Baptist minister of the State of New York, in writing 
home from Georgia, says, ' he traveled in company with one Csesar Blacka- 
moor, who was a Baptist minister, and a slave, the property of the Georgia 
Baptist Association !' 



THE PENITENT BOY. 

" Clear out, you nigger ! — we don't choose 

To have you in our play ;" 
So said a Christian father's son, 

And turned with scorn away. 

The little black boy, as the tears 

Came dropping from his eyes, 
Said kindly to the haughty lad, 

" 'Tis not so in the skies. 

" There, irTHhe songs of heavenly love 

The souls of all unite — 
And God does ne'er the question ask, 

If they were black or white. 

" Although you cast contempt on me, 

Nor let me join your play, 
To-ni^ht I will remember you, 

And for your welfare pray." 

These kind, soft words, like arrows sure, 

Were fastened in his heart — 
And in the haughty white boy's eyes 

The tears began to start. 

He asked forgiveness of the black, 

And then he wept aloud : 
" To play with you I never will 

In future be too proud." 

Together, hand in hand, they went 

To some sequestered spot: 
First one and then the other prayed, 

And heavenly wisdom sought. 

And now whene'er they meet they speak 

In kindness and in love — 
And hope when God shall call them hence 

To rest in peace above. 



34 FIRST ABOLITION MEETING. ANTI-SLAVERY DATES. 

FIRST ABOLITION MEETING. 

"We have recently had an interview with a person who was present 
at the first abolition meeting ever held in the United States. It took 
place in the township of Woodbridge, County of Middlesex, in this 
State, on the 4th of July, 1783, being the first anniversary of our Inde- 
pendence, after the close of the Revolutionary War. Great prepara- 
tions had been made — an ox was roasted, and an immense number had 
assembled on the memorable occasion. A platform was erected just 
above the heads of the spectators, and at a given signal, Dr. Bloomfield, 
father of the late Governor Bloomfield of this State, mounted the plat- 
form, followed by his fourteen slaves, male and female, seven taking 
their stations on his right hand and seven on his left. Being thus 
arranged, he advanced somewhat in front of his slaves, and addressed 
the multitude on the subject of slavery and its evils, and in conclusion 
pointing to those on his right and left : " As a nation," says he, " we are 
free and independent — all men are created equal, and why should these, 
my fellow-citizens — my equals, be held in bondage ? From this day 
they are emancipated, and I here declare them free and absolved from 
all servitude to me, or my posterity." Then calling up before him one 
somewhat advanced in years — "Hector," says the doctor, " whenever 
you become too old or infirm to support yourself, you are entitled to 
your maintenance from me or my property. ■ How long do you suppose 
it will be before you will require that maintenance V s Hector held up 
his left hand, and with his right drew a line acrost the middle joints of 
his fingers, saying — " Never, never, massa, so long as any of these fingers 
remain below these joints." Then turning to the audience, the Doctor 
remarked — " There, fellow citizens, you see that liberty is as dear to 
the man of color as to you or me." The air now rung with shouts of 
applause and thus the scene ended. 

Dr. Bloomfield immediately procured for- Hector, either by purchase or 
setting off from his own farm, three acres of land, and built him a small 
house, where he resided and cultivated his little farm until the day of 
his death,* and it was a common remark with the neighbors^ that Hec- 
tor's hay, when he took it to Amboy to sell, would always command a 
better price than theirs. — Newark Eagle. 



ANTI-SLAVERY DATES. 

1787. Committee formed in London for the Abolition of the Slave- 
Trad e. 
1807. Slave-Trade abolished by Great Britain and the United States. 
1823. Society formed in London for the immediate abolition of Slavery. 
1833. Act passed for abolishing Slavery in the British West Indies. 
1843. Slavery totally abolished in the British East Indies. 

* This took place within the last nine years, near Metuchin, in New Jer- 
sey, at the advanced age of 105 years. An interesting fact is connected with 
this gift of freedom and land. The son of Hector inherited it, and his widow 
now resides on it. The freed slaves generally took care of and supported 
themselves. 



A BEAUTIFUL FACT. 35 



A BEAUTIFUL FACT. 

A lady in England, about the year 1832, had left her, by a relative, a 
small legacy in the island of Antigua. It consisted of ten slaves, to be 
divided between herself and her brother, who was the overseer of a large 
plantation in the island. Her share consisted of a man, two women, and 
two children. 

Many would have said, ' Now I have an addition to my property !' 
But this good woman heard only the voice of God in this bequest, saying, 
' Here are five of my poor. I have sent them to you that you may 
deliver them from the hand of the oppressor." Her resolution was 
instantly taken; no doubts, no thoughts of wealth or inheritance clouded 
her vision ; but how shall she proceed ? Shall she trust her brother ? 
Alas! she knew him too well. To hire an agent, her means were not 
sufficient, and she took the heroic resolution that she would be herself 
the instrument of their deliverance. With her babe in her arms, she 
crossed the ocean at an inclement season of the year, and arrived at 
Antigua only to meet the reproaches of a brother, and the sneers and 
insults of almost the whole population. They told her of dangers and 
fears, but she went calmly on. They could not prevent her purpose, 
and the liberated slaves poured out their blessings and thanks amid tears 
of gratitude and joy. 

About six months after this event, a young missionary was about 
returning to England for his health, and was desirous of taking with him 
some preserves, shells, &rc, as presents to his friends. They happened 
to be very scarce at that time: at last, he heard of two women who had I 
a very fine stock. He went to their hut, and they willingly displayed 
their little store. ' Well, now,' said he, * name your price.' ' We no f 
want to sell them, massa,' was the reply. ' Why ? I will give a large j 
price for them, as I must sail to-morrow.' Still the reply was, ' We i 
cannot sell them, massa.' His curiosity was excited, and when they | 
could no longer with courtesy refuse to give a reason, they said, with a 
pathos and sweetness which thrilled the young man's heart, ' You no 
hear about our good missis, massa; how she came over the great sea, 
with ner little picaninny in her arms, and all to make us free : and how 
all the buckra massasand her brother mad with her 'bout we: and you 
think we ever forget her ? No ! massa, never. And so we getting 
these things, massa, to send to our kind missis !' 

Oh ! why will not mankind learn that love wins with peace and 
sweetness, what force labors in vain to compel ? 



Duty of Ministers. — Old John Adams understood well the duties of 
the pulpit. In a letter addressed to his wife, dated, Philadelphia, July 
7, 1774, he inquires, — 

" Does Mr. Willbind preach against oppression and the other cardinal 
vices of the times? Tell him the clergy here of every denomination, not 
excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten every Sabbath !" 



Hints to Quakers. — We are wearied and disgusted with 
ual cant, this unnecessary caution about working in r»»- 
time, for the promotion of the abolition of slaver - 
cautious enough about doing good. Wor 
those people work in, who do just no 1 
who do work ?

FOURTH OF JULY. 




FOURTH OF JULY. 

— — Men like household goods or servile beasts, 
Are bought and sold, kidnapped and pirated; 
Driven in droves e'en by the Capitol ; 
Then haul our striped and starry banner down ; 
Our cannon freight not ; step the noisy breath 
Of heartless patriotism ; be our praise unsung. 
To-day we'll not discourse of British wrong, 
Of valorous feats in arms by freemen bold, 
Nor spit, on kings, nor tauntingly call names ; 
But we will fall upon our bended knees, 
' weep in bitterness of heart, and pray 
1 to save us from his gathering wrath ; 
"-nger multiply our boasts 
* 1} are truly free. 

W. L. Garrison.
