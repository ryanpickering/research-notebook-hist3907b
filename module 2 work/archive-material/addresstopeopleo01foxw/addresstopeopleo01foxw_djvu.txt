NOtwithftanding the late determination of the 
Houfe of Commons on the Slave-Trade, we 
may hope that the difcuflion it has received will not be 
ufelefs ; and that the public attention has not been 
excited in vain, to a fyftem of cruelty which it is 
painful even to recite. It may be hoped that, claim- 
ing for ourfelves the moft perfect freedom, we fhall 
no longer impofe upon others a flavery the raoii op- 
preffivc ; and that, enjoying a degree of felicity un- 
equalled in any age or country, we fhall no longer 
range the world to incrcafe the mifery of mankind. 

The luft of power, and the pride of conqueft, have 
doubtlefs produced inftances far too numerous, of man 
enflaved by man. But we, in an enlightened age, have 
greatly furpafTed, in brutality and injuftice, the moft 
ignorant and barbarous ages: and while we are pre- 
tending to the fineft feelings of humanity, are exercif- 
ing unprecedented cruelty. We have planted flavery 
in the rank foil of fordid avarice j and the produce 
has been mifery in the extreme. We have afcertain- 
ed, by a courfe of experiments in cruelty, the lead 
portion of nourifhment requifite to enable man to lin- 
ger a few years in mifery ; the greateft quantity of la- 
bor which, in fuch a fituation, the extreme of punifh- 
ment can extort ; and the utmoft degree of pain, 
labor, and hunger united, that the human franae can 
endure. 

In vain have fuch fcenes been developed. The 
wealth derived from the horrid traffic, has created 
an influence that fecures its continuance, unlefs the 
people at large (hall refufe to receive the produce of 
robbery and murder. 

The Legiflature having refufed to Interpofe, the 
people arenowneceffarily called on, either to reprobate 
or approve the meafure 5 for Weft-India flavery muft 



■ ( 4 ) 
depend upon their fupport for its cxiAence ; and it 
is in the power of every individual to iocreafe, or to 
diminifli its extent. The laws of our country may 
indeed prohibit \is the iagiir-caae, unlcfs we will re- 
ceive it through the medium of flavery. They may ' 
hold it to our lips, fceeped in the blood of our fel- 
low-creatures j, but they cannot compel us to accept 
the loathfome potion. IVith us it refts, either to 
receive it and be partners in the crime, or to exone- 
rate ourfclves from guilt, by fpurning from us the 
temptation. For let us not think, that the crime 
re{is alone with thofe who conduct the traffic, or the 
Legiflature by which it is protected. If we purchafe 
the commodity, we participate in the crime. The 
fiave-dealer, the fiave-hokler, and the flave- driver, 
are virtually the agents of the confumer, and may be 
confidered as eoitployed and hired by him to procure 
the commodity. For, by holding out the temptati- 
on, he is the original caufe, the firft mover in the 
horrid procefs j and every diftin6\:ion is done away 
by the moral maxim, That whatever we do by ano- ' 
ther, we do ourfelves. 

Nor are we by any means warranted to confiderour 
individual fhare in producing thefe evils in a trivial 
point of vie'-v. The confumption of fugar in this 
country is.fo immenfe, that the quantity commonly 
ufed by individuals will have an important effecl. A 
family that ufes only 51b. of fugar per week, with the' ' 
proportion of rum, will, by abftaining from the con- 
fumption 21 months, prevent the flavery or murder 
of one fellow-creature*, eight fuch families in 194- 
years, prevent the flavery or murder of 100, and 
38,000 would totally prevent the Slave-Trade to fup- • 
ply our iflands. Nay, fo neceffarily conne<5led arc 
our confumption of the commodity, and the mifery"- 



( 5 ) 
TefuUing from it, that in every pound of fu-gar Mfed, 
(the produce of flaves imported from Africa) we 
may be confidered as confuniing two ounces of hu- 
man flefh, befides deftroying an alarming number o£ 
featnen by the SUve-Trade, and fpreading incon- 
ceivable anguifli, terror and difmay, through an im- 
menfe continentj by the burning of their villages, 
teariflg parents from their families, and children from 
their parents; breaking every bond of fociety, and 
dcftroying every fource of human happinefs. A French 
writer obferves, ** That he cannot look on a piece of^ 
fugar, without conceiving it ftained w^ith fpots of 
htimah blood :" and Dr. Franklin adds, that had he 
taken in all the cotifeqiiences, *' he might have fecti 
the fugar not merely fpotted, but thoroughly dyed 
fcarlet iti grain." 

Dreadful cohfideration---that our increafing hap- 
pinefs aiid profptrity has fpread delolation and mi- 
fery over a country as large as all Europe I For it 
is an indifputable fa<Sl:, that it is Britifh luxury, the 
African Slave Trade depends on for fupport : they 
have increafed, and they would fall together. Fot 
our confumption of fugar is now fo immenfe, that 
it nearly equals that of all Europe befides ; and Ja-* 
ftiaica now fupplies more than all our Weft-India 
Iflands did at any period prior to 17s 5» 

But amazingly extenllve as is the increafe of the 
culture, fo far is it frorri keeping pace with our lux^ 
ury, that (before the difturbances in the French If- 
lands> within thefe two or three years) fugars have 
ever fold in the Britifh market 20 or 30, fometimes 
^b per cent, dearer than in any other part of tile 
world. Nor is it to fupport the old plantations, as 
is pretended, but to form new ones, for the fuj*- 



( 6 ) 

ply cf this OTir increafing luxury, thnt the yvretch- 
cd Africans are torn froai their native land. 

Let us then imagiue our Imfnenfe confumption 
wholly, or in great part to ceafe, and our fugars to 
-be thrown on the foreign market's *, v/ould additional 
fiaves be wanted to fupply an overflowing market; at, a 
falling price r No : ths African Slavs Trade, by 
whomfoever conduced, to fupply fugar colonies, by 
xvhatevcr nation polTeiled, mufl totally ceafe. Hor- 
ror and difmay would give place to peace and civili- 
zation, through a coaPt oF above three thoufand miles 
extent, and abcve a thoufand miles inland : for fo 
cxtenfivs are our depredations, and Co extenfive are 
the benefits which it is in our power to^ confer. Nor 
would the beneficial effects ceafe, even here. The 
Wefl-India iflands, finding lefs demand for fugar> 
niuft appropriate lefs ground to the fugar-cane, and 
leave more for provifions : the Haves would be lefs 
worked, better fed, and in a few years confillintirely 
of native Creoles. Or if the planters appropriate 
the land to the other produdlions of the iflands, the 
fame beneficial efFe<Sts inufi: enfue. For M. Cooke 
tells us, *' the cultivation of cotton, pimento, and 
-•* co:ffec, is eafier than fugar: the fi^ives look better, 
and Increafe faftcr ;" and infteadof requiring additi- 
onal ilaves, they v^rould be able to increafe their plan- 
tations with thofe already in the iflands.^ For Go- 
vernor Pari-y fays, " ont- acre of fygar requij-es ,as 
** much labour as three of cotten" Thus our re- 
fraining from the confumption of the fugar-cane,,ey^i| 
for a few years, would deftroy;iJie Slave Tra;de.tQ,.tf?e 
Weft^India IQands, bring frefh land in.ro xuUure^ and 
place the flaves in fuch a fituaiion, that ihcy mufc 
rapid lyjncrftafe, 



( 7 ) 
The diminution of the confumption cf V/efl I^dia 
produce, would nifo have a po^ve^ful effe€\ by link- 
ing thje price of tiie com modi ly y and thereby take a- 
way the temptation to iiiiport addiilQiial flaves. The 
effect a fn^iall variatiGa io, th^ fupply of dcrE-and has 
on' the price, wje have rs<:entlylexperienced. ' The di- 
iluibances'in the Fi-ench fugar iilards^ has fuddeniy 
raired/omc of the maikecs, i^hich were 20 or 3c per 
cent, lower than the Britiih, much above it ; and 
thereby occaiiuntd an exporr.iricn from this country 
10. iupply the deficiency r and our txporcation, though 
only anitvinting to a lOth of oui' importation, has 
raifed our fu gars 50 per cent. And as a fall in the 
price would obftrucl the Slave Trade, and meliorate 
the condition cf the il.iycs ; fo this rife will produce 
cSecls the raoft baneful. The planter, tempted by 
the high price to get uigar and rum to market while 
that high price continues, wiU deprive his flaves of 
their provition grounds, to plant them v/ith canes ; 
and by the energy of the v.hip, they will be forced 
to the moO: extreme exertions. '1 he murder, or, in 
the technical language of the Weft-Indies, the /&/s of 
his flaves, v.-ill be tp him but a fecondary coniidera- 
lion. The large crop, and the high price, v/ill am- 
ply com pen fate him: and the qucftion nov/ is, not 
merely whether we ihall hold out to him an induce- 
ment to purchafe additional flaves; but whether we 
fliall tempt him to murder thole he already has. Wc 
can hardly doubt, but that Weil India packets have 
already borne the murderous dlipatches, exprefTed in 
language too dicadfully explicit, and to the follow- 
ing eiTcct. '* The price of iugar and rum itill continues 
*' high. You muft adopt every mode to fprw.ard as 
** large a cargo as poliible. A fortunate crih5 now 
** o5ers iticlf for eitricatino my efuiefron-i tlie diili'- 



( i^ ) 

'* cnlties In which it is involved. We muft avail Oiir- 
*^ felvcs of it: another may never occur. Confe- 
" qiiences, though difagreeable, mufl at the prefent 
*-* moment be overlooked. The (lave market is. ftill 
" open for a fupply. Ncvj-fangied- humanity is iw 
*^ mcrey The day hardly dawns when the whip re- 
founds through thofe regions of horror; nor ceafes, 
till darknefs clofes the fcene, which day after day is 
renewed. The miferable viclims, deCiitute of every 
f^urce of comfort to body or to mind, and finking 
under the three endemic difeafcs of our iflands, hun- 
ger, torture, and extreme labour; and urg^d t'6 ex- 
ertions they z^re unable to fuftain, at lengrh expire 
beneath the laOi, which in vain endeavours to roufe 
them to a renewal of their labour. 

As neither the flave-dealer, nor the planter, cart 
have any moral right to the perfon of him they 
fiile their fiave, to his labour, or to the produce of 
it ; fo they can convey no right in that produce to 
us: and whatever number of hands it may pafs thrb* 
if the criminal circumftances appertaining to it be 
known to them at the time of the transfer, they can 
only have a criminal pofTeffion : and the money paid^ 
either for the Have, or for the produce of his labour, 
is paid to obtain that criminal pofTeffion; and can con- 
fer no moral right whatever, So, if the death of the 
perfon called a flave, be occafioncd by the criminal 
pofTeffion, the criminal poffiefTor is guilty of murder; 
and we, who have knowingly done any a<Si; which 
might occafion his being in that iituationj are aecef- 
laries to the murder hefore the fa(Sl; as by receiving 
the produce of his labour, we are acceffiiries to the 
robbery, after the fadl. 

If we, as individuals concerned in the Slave Trade 
Tmhcr by procuring the ilaves, compelling theni to 



( 9) 
labour, or receiving the produce) imagine that our 
iliare in the tranfaiftion is fo minute that it cannot 
perceptibly increafe the injury; let us recoile<El that, 
though numbers partaking of a crime may diminifti 
the fliame, they cannot diminifh its turpitude. Can wc 
fuppofe, that an injury of enormous magnitude caa 
take pbre, and the criminality be deftroyed merely 
by the criminals becoming fo numerous as to render 
their refpedive fhares indiftinguifhable? Were an 
hundred aflaflins to plunge their daggers into their 
viiflim, though each might plead, that without his 
affiflance the crime would have been compleated, and 
that his poinard neither occaiioned nor accelerated 
the murder, yet every one of them w^ould be guilty 
of the intire crime. For into how many parts foever 
a criminal a£lion maybe divided, the crime iifelfrefts 
intire and compleat on every perpetrator. 

3ut waving this latter confideration, and even fup- 
poiing for a moment, that the evil has an exiftence 
from caufes totally independent of us, yet it exifts ; 
and as we have it in our power jointly wirh others, to 
remedy it, it is undoubtedly our duty to contribute 
our fliare, in hope that others will theirs -, and to a£l 
that part from confcience, which we fhould from in- 
clination in iimilar cafes that interefted our feelings. 

For inftance: Let us fuppofe the Algerines to eftab- 
lifli fugar plantations, and refort to the banks of the 
Thames for Haves, as the only place to be infulted with 
impunity. Suppofe our wives, our hufbands, ouf 
children, our parents, our brethren, fwept away, and 
the fruit of their labour, produced with agonizing 
hearts and trembling limbs, landed at the port of 
London. What would be our condua? Should wc 
fay. Sugar is a necefTary of life ? I cannot do without 
it. Befides, the quantity I ufe is but a fmall propor- 



( lo ) 
tion: and though it is very criminal of the Algcrines 
to enflave others, yet I am not bound to look to the 
nature or co.nfequences of the tranfacftion ; and pay- 
ing for the fugar, I have a right to confume it, how- 
ever it may Iiave been obtained. If fucli would be 
our language in that cafe, be it fo on the prefent oc- 
cafion. For let us recolleci, that the only difference 
is, that in one cafe our relation to the enilaved is ra- 
ther more remote, but that in both cafes they are oui' 
brethren. 

But it is hardly requiilte to ftate fo ftrong a cafe as 
that fuppofed. For were only one EngliOiman to re- 
ceive injuries, that bor€ but the flightell: refemblancc 
to thofe daily committed in our iflands, the nation 
would be inflamed with refentment, and clamorous 
to avenge the injury. And can our pride fugged to 
us, that the .rights of men are limited to any nation, 
pr to any colour? Or, were any one to treat a fellow 
creature in this country as we do the unhappy Afriw 
cans in the Weft-Indiesj flruck with horror, wefliould 
be zealous to deliver the opprefTed, and punifli the 
opprefTor. Are then the olnces of humanity and 
funfdonsofjuftice to be circumfcrlbed by geographi- 
cal boundaries? Can reafon, can confcience juftify 
this contrafc in our condudl, between our prompti- 
tude, in the one cafe, and our torpor in the other? 
Mr. Addifon juftly obferves, that " humanity to be- 
come eftimable nnirt be combined v/iih jufticei" But 
we feem to a6t as if we thought that the relief of our 
fellow-creatures; prote(flion from injuries, commu- 
nication of benefits, were works of fuperero^atibn, to 
be granted or with-held, as caprice, or cuflom, or 
inclination may fuggeft. 

After the important confideratioris adduced, it 
iTxioht be reckoned a degradation of the fubjedt to 



menti9;rr the n^itional dignity; or even that might In- 
duse us to counteracfk a powerful body cf men, who 
are trampling under foot the diflates o£ humanity, 
and the intereft of the nation : men, who have in 50 
^eais received for fugar alone^ above 70 millions more 
than'it vvQuId have cofl: at any other market. And 
from Mr. Botham's evidence it appears, that in Bata- 
via, where labour is as high as in England, fugar^ 
equal to the beft Weil-India, is fold at id halfpenny 
per pouud, Thefe are the men, who are endea- 
\ourii>g to overthrow a plan for fupplying us with 
fugars, by means of free labour; and have the auda- 
city to tell the Britifli legiflature, *' Tiiat they cannot 
aboiifli the flave trade ; for that if England refufe to 
furniOi them with flaves, they will obtain a fupply 
through other channels." And a governor of Barba- 
does admoniflKs us, ** From policy, to leave the iflands- 
to the quiet management of theh' own affiiirs." Thele 
nominal colonies iiave, it feems, been taught, that 
we have n^o right to controul them ; that the acts of 
their AiTemlDles alone are obligatory; and that thof^ 
ot Britiih legiilators, are binding only on thofe v/honi 
they reprefent. The right of enilaving others, they 
contend for, as the niofl: valuable of their privile<^es. 
Thus it appears, that the legiflature is not only 
unwdlllng, but perhaps unable, to grant redrefs; ancl 
therefore it is more peculiarly incum.hent on us, To 
ahfiainfrGm the vfe of fugar and rum, until our IVeJt^ 
India Planters thcinflves have prohibited the itnpcrta- 
iion of additional flave Sy and commenced as fpeedj and 
effeaual afubverfon cf flavery in their iflands, as tha 
circumfances andfituation of the flaves will admit :'Ir 
till we can obtain the produce of the fugar cane in fome 
other mode, unconne^cd with flavery, and unpolluted 
with blood. 



( 12 ) 
For furcly it may be hoped that we fliall not lamit 
our views merely to the abolition of the African flave 
trade, as the colonial flavcry formed on it, is in its 
principle equally unjuft. For if it be iniquitous to 
force the Africans from their native land; equally 
iniquitous muft it be, to retain them and ijieir pofte- 
rity in perpetual bondage. Though the African 
flave trade be the moO: Prominent feature in this 
wickednefs, yet it is but a feature: and where it 
abolilhed, the Weft India flavery would ftill exin. 
Our planters would breed, inftead of importing (laves j 
and fhall we fuffer half a million of fellow fubjeas, 
and their poaerity, to be held in flavery for ever ? I 
fay, fellow fubjeas. For undoubtedly, every perfon 
born in the dominions of Great Britain is a fubjecb, 
bound to obey and entitled to the protetflion of the 
common law of England ; and in oppofition to which 
the a<fls of AiTemblies, exifting merely by grant from 
the crown, can be of no authority. 

In demanding liberty then for the perfons called 
flaves in our iflands, we demand no more then they 
are entitled to by the common law of the land. The 
moft eligible mode of putting them in pofltflion of 
their legal and natural right, may be a queftion of 
difficulty; but it is a queftion that ought to be con- 
iidercd with no other view, but to their happincfs. 
The plan to be adopted, ought to be certain and 
fpeedy in its operation ; without any confideration of 
the fuppofed, or even real intereft, of their oppref- 
fors : and let it be remembered, that it i* in the pow- 
er of a fmall proportion of the people of England to 
effecl it, by refufing to receive the produce. For the 
planters themfelves would adopt the plan, were that 
the only condition on which we would confume the 
.produce of their iflands: nor would the legiflature be 



( 13 ) 

then harraiTcJ with prepoflerous claims for compen- 
fluion; which, however unfounded in jullice or rea- 
fon, will be fupportedby influence, and enforced with 
-clamour. 

The cafe now full^ lies before us ; and we have 
to make our choice, either to join ourfelves with thef^ 
manufadurers of iiuman woe, or to renounce the 
horrid aiTociatioa. It we adopt the former, let us at 
leaft have the candour to avow our conduct in its real 
deformity. L^t us no longer afiecl to deplore the car 
lamities attendant on the Slave Trade, of which tvc 
are tlie primary caufe : nor let us pretend to execrats 
the condudc o£ the flave-dealer, the ilave-holder, or 
the {lave-driver 5 but apologize for them as cur part- 
ners in iniquity : and be aiTured, that if we now take 
cur fhare in the tran faction, we fhould, were we placr 
ed in a iimiiar fituatipn with them, with as little com-r 
pun£lion take theirs; unlefs we can fuppofe the or- 
der of nature would be fo far inverted, as that we 
ihould become virtuous, in proportion as the temp- 
tation to vice increafed. Nor Ihould we then, any 
more then now, be deftitute of fubterfuges to deftroy 
the feelings of our minds, and the convidtions of ouc 
confciences. 

If ignorance and inattention may be pleaded as our 
excufe hitherto, yet that can be the cafe no longer. 
The fubjecl has been four years before the public. Its 
dreadful wickednefs has been fully proved- Every 
falfliood, every deception with which it has been dif- 
giiifed, has been compleatly done away; and it Hands 
before us in all its native horrors. No longer can it 
be pretended, that Africa is a barbarous, uncultivated 
land, inhabited by a race of favages inferior to the 
reft of the human fpecics. Mr. How, who was m- 
ployed by government to go up the country, depofej. 



( 14 ) 
thit in land it is every where well cultIrF!ted, abound- 
ing with rice, millet, pot.!'- e^.. c'-aor; .-^ikI indigo 
plantations; and that the )u -:-'^\anis are qviick in 
learning laoguagt-s^ and reraark;.: "y iridartrious, hof- 
pitable and obliging. 'It appears that they pofieTs no- 
ble and heroic minds, difdaining flnvery, and frequent- 
ly feeking refuge from it in the arms of death. Nor 
ihall we be again told, of the fuperior happinefs they 
enjoy under the benevolent care of the planters-, Mr. 
Coor having depofed, that ** fetting flaves to work 
** in the morning, is attended with loud peals of 
** whipping;" — and General Tottenham, ** that there 
'* is no comparifon between regimental flogging, which 
*' only cuts the Ikin, and the plantation, which cuts 
" out the flefli ;"— Capt. Hall, *« that the punifli- 
** ments are very fhocking, much more fo then in 
** .men of war -" Capt. Smith, ** that at every fbroke 
*^ of the whip a piece of flefli is cut out,"— and Mr. 
Rofs, ** that he conflders a comparifon betv/een Weft- 
" India flaves, and the Britifh peafantry, as an infult 
** to common fenfe." 

We are now called on to redrefs evils, in compari- 
fon with which, all that exift in this nation iink be- 
Ticath our notice *, and the only facrifice we are re- 
quired to make in order to effe<ft it, is the abandon- 
ing of a luxury^ which habit alone can have rendered 
of importance. If we refufe, can we form the leaft 
pretence to a moral character ? May it not be juftly 
inferred, that thofe numerous difplays of humanity, 
of which this kingdom boafts, have not their foun- 
dation in any virtuous or valuable principle ; but that 
to cuftom and oRentation they owe their origin ? And 
if our execration of the flave trade be anymore than 
mere declamation againft crimes we are not in a fitu- 
ati^f> to commit, we ihall, inftcad of being foUck- 



( '5 ) 
ous to fine! defpicable diftiajStions to juftify our con- 
daft, abhor ihe idc-?. of contributing, in the leaft de- 
cree, to fuch fcenes of miferv. 

If thefe be the deduftions from the mofl obvious 
principles of re.ifoi^, juifice, and humanify, Avhat muft 
be the refult if we extend our views to icligious eon- 
iiderations ? It will hardly be faidj that we affume a 
religious profeiliion to d^iminiih the extent of our mo- 
ral duties, or to weaken the force of our obligation 
to obferve them. 

We will therefore aik, if it be meant to infult the 
God we pretend to woifhip, by fupplicating him to 
•"^ have mercy upon all prifoners and captives," and ta 
** defend and provide for the farherlefs, widows, and 
<* children, and all that are defolate and opprefTed." 
But, if the national religion be a mere matter of form, 
yet fureiy we may cxpe6l that the various denomina- 
tions of diffenters, will think it at the leafb as requi- 
fite to diiTent from the national crimes, as the nation- 
al religion ; urilefs they mean to exhibit confciences 
of fo peculiar a texture, as to take offence at the re- 
ligion of their country, while they can conform with- 
out fcruple, to its moft criminal practices. If indeed 
they are fatisjSed, after an impartial examination, that 
the traffic alluded to is fair and honeft, and that the 
produce ought to be considered as the refult of lawful 
commerce, it will become them to encourage it ; it 
will become them to reprobate this work as an attempt 
to flander honeft men, and to injure their property, 
by holding ft out to the public, as the produce of rob* 
bcry and murder. But, if the arguments be valid, 
will they prefume to treat the fubje<fl with cool indif- 
ference, and continue a criminal practice? May we 
not ^Ifo hope that the Methodifts, who appear to feel 
forcibly their principles, will feriouily confidcr it ? 



( i6 ) 
Th^y are £%) numerous, as to be able of tbenvfelves to 
defti-oy ihat dreadful tralEc, which is the fole obfta- 
cle to their miiiircers fpreading the gofpel in the ex- 
tenfive continent of Africa; and, however others 
.may afFecStto degrade the Negroes, they are bound to 
confider thourands of them as their brethren in Chrifh 
But there is one ciafs of diiTenters who juAly ftand 
high in the public eil:imatiors, for their fteady, manly 
and uniform oppofition to our coloni-al flavery. And 
can 5t be fiippofed thcit, after having awakened the 
pubh'c attention, they can refufe to contribute what 
is in their own power to remedy the evil? The p!ati 
propofed, is a plain and obvious dediidtion from th(^*|' 
uniform principle, of having no concern in what they 
diiapprove. Thus, confidering war as unlawful, th6y
