Resolved, That this Society would recommend to all ', in one class, and dependence and servility in the other, 
those interested in Social Reform to become subscribers :■ creating physical and mental imbecility; and whereas 
to the " CoMMUNiTisT," tfio Organ of the Skancatc- ; our social duties may be embraced in the following 
los Community, that while it is free to all, " without ; sentence, viz.: — " Therefore alt things whatsoever ye 
ino:icy and without price," yet its publication depends would that men should do unto you, do ye even the 



same unto them;" and wiiereas society not only dis- ; 
courages the practical application of this sublime and ( 
ennobling precept, but, on the contrary, encourages J 
fraud, deception and crime; — and whereas labor-sav-J 
ing machinery, and all scientific improvements, adapt- ', 
ed, in a true social condition, to exonerate man from 
the toil and excess of burdens to which he is now ne- ' 
cessarily subjected, are converted into instruments of 
tyranny and oppression, — they surfeit the market,' — ■> 
they diminish the demand for hand labor, — they throw j 
many^ entirely out of employment; — they reduce the j 
wages and means of support among those having em- > 
ployment; and whereas this individual interest has; 
robbed the people of the soil and its products, their 
birthright, by which the whole of -life is a struggle to ' 
live, requiringall their power to resist the overwhelm- ' 
ing and multiform encroachments of capital; and J 
whereas, if man has an inalienable right to life, it;; 
legitimately follows that he has an inalienable right ' 
to that which can alone sustain life — that all withhold- j 
ing from the destitute the necessaries of life audi 
means of enjoyment, unless they have an equivalent) 
to give in exchange, is a practical denial of this prin- J 
ciple; and whereas if there was no individual and ab- ; 
solute proprietorship in the earth and its products, ; 
there would be no buying and selling, and hence no ; 
temptation to fraud, theft, slavery, piracy, or war;; 
and whereas the principle which recognises the legiti-J 
macy of individual and absolute ownership in the soil j 
and the products of human industry, by which these 
become the objects of speculation, of barter and sale, ) 
is the greatest outrage that can be inflicted upon the | 
race, and is the fruitful source of all the evils of civil- j 
ized society; and whereas in our present isolated socie- 
ty, with its enormous outlay for separate labor, build- > 
ings, teams, fences, fuel, &c., with but one quarter of j 
society, producing any thing that is really valuable — ; 
so boundless and inexhaustible are the resources of the j 
earth, that there is, if equally enjoyed by all, enough ; 
to satisfy the wants of the entire community ; and > 
whereas, when the people shall unite in communities, ; 
and all become producers, and, without infringing;, 
upon the rights of the individual — take advantage of J 
labor-saving machinery, and all the economies of as- ; 
soriations, superseding by this unity and oneness of) 
interest, the necessity for governments of force, with \ 
their armies and navies, prisons and gibbets, for a } 
hireling priesthood, for speculators, bankers, and all / 
other supernumeraries, then the productions of the ; 
earth will be so abundant that no one need take ; 
thought, saying, "What shall I eat, or what shall I '> 
drink, or wherewithal shall I be clothed?" — then the i 
end and aim of all man's efforts would be, not to ac- ; 
cumulate as now, but to develope full and harmonious- ; 
ly his entire nature; and whereas the human mind is ; 
in its nature progressive and adapted to receive, ap-j 
preciate and follow the truth; and whereas this pres- J 
ent selfish and isolated society, not only discourages ; 
progression, but forbids it, threatening as a penalty, j 
both reputation and living, thus offering the greatest J 
possible encouragement to the practice of deception, ', 
hypocrisy and intolerance; and whereas the three 5 
learned professions have their origin in the infraction j 
of the physical, mental and social laws of our nature, f 
and the instincts of self-preservation lead them rather J 
to perpetuate than to destroy the cause of their exist- \ 
ence; and whereas written, traditional and oral autho- ; 
rities, creeds and sects, governments of force and po- ' 



liticai parties, are checks to freedom of thought, and ( 
freedom of action — (indispensable to intelligence, 
purity and peace;) and whereas every thought has its; 
foundation in a material organ of the hrain — that J 
man's character is the product of the physical consti- i 
tution and the peculiar organization of the brain which J 
he receives at birth, together with his education and ', 
the combined influences which surround him from birth S 
to death, — it therefore follows, that all rewards and ; 
punishments, other than those which inhere in man, >, 
^d follow his act — all praise and blame are unnatural ; 
.■^/id artificial excitants which tend to vitiate and de- ) 
.prave rather than to purify and exalt his mind; and j 
whereas the idea which so universally obtains that' 



man is morally, mentally and physically depraved — • 
that vice, ignorance and indolence are the natural 
product of his being, and that virtue, intelligence and 
industry are exotics, and not the legitimate and natur- 
al fruit of all true minds; and whereas if man's nature 
is adapted to health, virtue and intelligence, it follows, 
that when society is constituted so as to harmonise 
with the wants of his being, disease, vice and ignor- 
ance must soon disappear; and whereas all human 
action, which is not mechanical, arises from the 
strongest motive in the mind of the actor, therefore 
one great object of reform should be to remove all 
temptation to idleness, selfishness and vice, and to 
give encouragement to industry, benoT-oIcnce and vii*- 
tue;' andwirereas a healthy and vigorous organization 
is absolutely indispensable to clearness of mind, to 
purity and benevolence of character; and whereas the 
present mode of slaying animals to satisfy man's per- 
verted appetite, not only adds immensely to his labor, 
— predisposes his person to disease, — stimulates his 
selfish and combative properrsities, — awakens into 
life and activity his lustful passions, — vitiates his en- 
tire constitution, — gives the animal the ascendency 
over his moral and intellectual nature, but is supreme- 
ly selfish, acting, as he does, upon the principle that 
might makes right — the principle which gover'ns all 
tyrants — cruel in the highest degree to the animals — 
familiar'ises his mind with suffering and fits, and pr'c- 
pares him to exercise cruelly over his own species; 
and whereas we believe that a true state of society 
can be predicated upon the unchanging laws of man's 
nature, by which an equality of rights and a oneness 
of interest may be secured to all, and to obtain this 
most desirable end, and to examine into the nature 
and truth of all the propositions above enuruerated, 
we form ourselves into arr Association to be governed 
by the following

reason and moral suasion, unencumbered by oi-ganised
