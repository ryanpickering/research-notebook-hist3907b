AMERICAN 



ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



%* For the calculations of this Almanac we are indebted to the Christian Alma- 
nae for 1842. 

Note. — Use the Calendar under the State in which you reside, and the corres- 
ponding column of Moon 's Phases at the top of the page, and no calendar can be 
more simple or convenient. 

Eclipses in 1842. 

I. Three Eclipses of the Sun — At the time of New Moon, in January, July, 
and December, all invisible in the United States. (1.) Jan. 11, annular at the south 
pole ; visible in South Africa ; central and annular in long. W. from Greenwich, 
57° 28' ; S. lat. 88° 41'. (2.) July 8, will be central and total E. long. 77° 27', N. 
lat. 51° 47', and pass central and total through Europe and Asia. At London, 9.61 
digits eclipsed on sun's south limb. (3.) Dec. 31, visible throughout South America 
and New Zealand ; centrai and annular, W. long. 104° 21', S. lat. 33° 18'. 

II. Two Eclipses of the Moon. — (1.) Jan. 26, at the time of Full Moon, in- 
visible in America ; visible in nearly the whole Eastern hemisphere. (2.) Eclipse 
of the Moon on Friday, July 22, morning ; invisible at Boston and New- York, but

fpf The Calendar page in this Almanac is adapted for nse in every part of the 
United States. It is based on the fact, that, in the same Latitude, that is, onaline 
running due East and West, the Sun and Moon rise and set at the same viomentby 
the clock or Almanac, not only throughout the United States, but around the world — 
the variations being so small as to be of no importance for ordinary purposes. Thus, 
if on any day the sun rises at Boston at five minutes past six, it rises at five minutes 
past six on the same line of latitude westward throughout the States of Massachu- 
setts, New- York, and Michigan, and so on to the Pacific Ocean. 

Hence, a Calendar adapted to Boston for New-England, is equally adapted, as 
to the rising and setting of the sun and moon, for use in Northern New- York and 
Michigan. A Calendar for New- York city is adapted for use in the States of Penn- 
sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A Calendar for Baltimore is adapted for 
Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri. And a Calendar for Charleston will answer for 
North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana. 

Wherever, then, the reader may reside, by looking for the State at the top of the 
Calendar page, he will find underneath the rising and setting of the sun and moon 
sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes. 

The changes, fulls, and quarters of the Moon, however, are governed by another 
principle, and are essentially the same for all places on the same Longitude, u 
is, on any line extending due north and south. Thus, the moon's phases for Charles- j- 
ton suit Pittsburgh, &c. Any phasis takes place at the same instant of absolute I

time ; but the local time is earlier at the westward, and later at the eastward, at 
the rate of/our minutes for ea,ch degree of Longitude; or at the rate of one minute 
for every 12 miles 273 rods in the latitude ol Boston ; 13 miles 60 rods in the lati- 
tude of New- York city ; 13 miles 143 rods in the latitude of Baltimore j and 14 
miles 199 rods in the latitude of Charleston. 

The Sun's declination, as masters of coasting vessels will observe, is adapted in 
this calendar to the meridian of New- York city. The declination varies most 
rapidly about the time of the equinoxes ; but even then, it changes but 1' while the 
sun is passing from the meridian of New- York to that of New-Orleans or St. Louis. 
The column of sun's declination is therefore designed, like the days of the week 
and month, for general use throughout the country. 



Clock Time. 

This Almanac shows the rising and setting of the Sun, &c. according to a clock 
that keeps accurate time throughout the year. As the Sun is sometimes fast or 
slow of clock, the forenoon will of course be, by clock, so much longer or shorter 
than the afternoon. Some observing this, think they have found an error in the 
Almanac ; but it is no error. The table, " Sun on the Meridian," at the head of 
the Calendar pages, shows at what moment the Sun, according to a true clock, is 
on the meridian, or strikes an accurate noon-mark. The London Nautical Alma- 
nac, and a large portion of the Almanacs in our country, are now adapted to true, 
or clock time.

Effects of Drinking. 

Wine and other physical exhilerants, during the treacherous truce to wretched- 
edness which they afford, dilapidate the structure, and undermine the very founda- 
tion of happiness. No man, perhaps, was ever completely miserable, until af'er he 
had fled to alcohol for consolation. The habit of vinous indulgence is not nore 
pernicious than it is obstinate and pertinacious in its hold, when it has once fastened 
itself upon the constitution. It is not to be conquered by half-way measures. The 
victory over it, in order to be permanent, must be perfect. As long as there lurks 
a relic of it in the frame, there is imminent danger of a relapse of this moral malady, 
from which there seldom is, as from plvysical disorders, a gradual convalescence. 
The cure, if at all, must be effected at once ; cutting and pruning will do no good.

The Ballot-Box. 

We have a weapon, firmer set 
And better than the bayonet-^- 
A weapon that comes down as still 
As snow flakes fall upon the sod ; 
But executes a freeman's will 
As lightning does the will of God. 



" I'll aslc my Wife." 

That is what old Judge Thatcher, of Massachusetts, said to Blount, of North 
Carolina, when they were members of Congress, at Philadelphia, and when the 
latter challenged the Judge to fight a duel . " I'll ask my wife, sir," replied the 
Judge, taking off his three-cornered hat and making a bow ; " and if she is willing, 
I'll meet you." 

Unconstitutional Law of Alabama. 

"And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for any person to seize and 
make a slave for life, to his own use, any free person of color who may have come 
into the state of Alabama since the first day of February, 1832 ; and be it further 
enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for any person to seize upon and make a 
slave for life, any free person of color who may be found in the state of Alabama 
after the passage of this act, and who shall have come into the state since its pas- 
sage."— Approved, Feb. 2, 1839. 

It will be perceived at once that all this is in direct defiance of the following 
provision of the Constitution of the United States. 

" The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities 
of citizens in the several states." — Constitution of the United States, Art. IV. Sec. 2.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERlf ALMANAC. 



Notes on the Census Tables. 

1. The ratio of increase is surprisingly uniform in each ten years$ having never 
Varied more than a small fraction from 34 per cent. This will give a population, in 
I860, of 22,848,581, and in 1860, of 30 millions. It doubles in 24 years. 

2. The increase of the free states is about 39 per cent., and of the slave states but 
26. At this rate, they will stand, in 1850, in the proportion of 4 to 3 in population^ 
and in political power as 7 to 4. But the disproportion is every year greater. 

3. The increase of the slaves in the preceding ten years, was 29.5 per cent. ; in 
the last ten, only 24*5 per cent. Had the ratio been the samej the number would 
have been 2,581,646. The difference) 98,1 10 j nearly a hundred thousand, must be 
set down as the waste of life created by the opening of the new plantations in the 
3outh West, the growth of sugar, and the misery created by the forced removal of 
the hundred thousand victims of the American Domestic Slave Trade. 

4i The new states have gained, in slaves, beyond their proportion, 315,125. So 
many Americans have been forcibly removed from home and kindred under our Re- 
publican Government. 

5. The increase of the free colored people is 57,336 2 or 21 per cent* The small- 
hess of the increase is not easily accounted for. The increase in the free states is 
24 per cent;, that of the South but 19 per cent. 

6. The increase of the six new free states and Territories of the North West, is 
102 per cent. Should the same ratio continue, which is highly probable, those states 
will have a population of about six millions in 1850. 

7» The proportion of slaves to the white population, in 1830, was 15.5 per cent. S 
in 1840, it v/as but 13.9 per cent. 

8. The Federal number is made, according to the TJ. S. Constitution, by adding to 
the free inhabitants, " three fifths of all other persons," i. e., of slaves. The num- 
ber of representatives has been calculated on the supposition that they will be ap* 
portioned at the rate of one per 60,000. By the Federal numbers, the slave states 
have 97 representatives in Congress 5 by their free population they would have but 
73 ; were all the population free, they would have 104, or rather, there would then 
be no distinction of North and South. 

9. By the new census, the slave states will have 38.6 per cent, of the federal 
power — by the census of 1830 they had 41 per cent. — by their free population they 
would now have but 32 per cent. — by the whole number they would have 40 per cent. 

10. Slaves have no political power, no political consideration whatever them* 
selves, being, in fact, mere property ; but the southern states have 24 representa* 
tives on account of the slaves — 24.7 per cent of their representation, equal to 9 per 
cent, of the federal power of the union as the mere representatives of property— 
and such property. 

N. B. No other species of property entitles a state to political power. 

11. Three of the free states, New- York, New- Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and three 
of the slave states, Maryland, Virginia, and Missouri, have each one representative 
on account of their free colored inhabitants. 

12. The land dividend is calculated upon the supposition that there will be three 
millions of dollars to divide yearly, under the act of Congress of 1841. The table 
shows what each state will receive by the federal numbers, according to the existing 
law, and what each would receive were the distributions made according to the free 
population, who alone can be benefited, and who alone can be taxed to make up the 
deficiency to the TJ. S. treasury. 

13. By the census of 1790, the free states had 60 per cent, of the white population, 
45 per cent, of the free colored, and 50 per cent, of the whole. Now they have 68 
per cent, of the white, 44 per cent, of the free colored, and 57 per cent, of the whole. 

14. In 1790, the population of Virginia, 748,308, was greater than of New- York 
and Pennsylvania together ; and Ohio had not begun to be settled. Now Virginia 
is behind all these States. 

15. Virginia, with 70,000 square miles, has now but 50 per cent, as many people 
as New England, with 66,000. In 1790, she had 70 per cent. New England has in- 
creased from 1,009,813, to 2,432,818— an increase of 142 per cent, in 50 years, while 
Virginia has gained, in the same time, but 491,489, being 65 per cent. 



AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 

Illinois and South Carolina are now equal in power — i. e. the 267,360 free people 
of S. C. weigh as mush in national influence as 475,852 in Illinois — about in the pro- 
portion of two Carolinians to three Illinoians. And when it comes to receiving 
money, each free person in Illinois divides 18.8 cts. and each free person in South 
Carolina 32.6 cents, or in the proportion of $1 to a Carolinian as often as the Illi- 
noian receives 57 cents. 

New Jersey has a free population greater by one-tenth than that of Alabama, yet 
New Jersey receives $70,130, from the public purse, and Alabama $91,996. The 
free population of New Jersey is greater than that of Mississippi and Louisiana 
together, which states receive by the land distribution $28,167 more than N. Jersey. 

On the free basis, the six northern states would receive $460,366 yearly, and 
the six southern states only $299,165. Consequently, they first gain 12 represen- 
tatives for their slave property, and then a yearly gift of $115,980, for being the 
owners of property so peculiarly meritorious ! While New England is mulcted in 
the yearly penalty of $40,224, for the crime against republicanism of refusing to 
hold slaves. 

New- York has a free population of more than half the entire south, yet she re- 
ceives but 38 per cent as much money. Her power to uphold the government and 
defend the country is greater and more available than that of the whole slave sec- 
tion, because she has no internal enemies ; yet she has 40 representatives and they 
97; she receives $456,636, and they $1,181,702. By a free basis, New- York would 
receive $500,357, and the whole south $991,206. 



Mountains. 

" For the strength of the hill, we bless thee I 

Our God, or fathers' God ! 
Thou hast made thy children might, 

By the strength of the mountain sod ! 
For the strong pine of the forest 

That by thy breath is stirred — 
For the deep gorge of the mountain, 

Where thy still voice is heard — 
For the deep storm on whose free pinions 

Thy spirit walks abroad — 
For the strength of the hills we bless thee ! 

Our God, our fathers' God !" 

The spirit of liberty dwells in the mountains ! It was with the Scots who bled 
with Wallace ! It was with Switzerland, on the hills of the Vandis, sustaining the 
Waldenses against their ruthless persecutors ! It was with William Tell when he 
fought for the freedom of his native land ! It was with the Tyrohse, when on the 
green hills of Tyrol the gong of freedom sounded ! It is now with the brave Cir- 
cassians, on the hills of Caucasus, assisting them to crush the hordes of the Rus- 
sian tyrant ! 

We expect, ere long, to see the movements of the same spirit in the mountains 
of East Tennessee. 



Southern Debts. 

The South is indebted to the manufacturers of slave-shoes in Lynn, Massachu- 
setts, about $3,000,000 ; to the city of New York more than $100,000,000 ; and to 
the whole North from 3 to $500,000,000. Such statements we have seen going the 
rounds of the press. Can they be true ? If so, we seem to have something to do 
with the domestic system of the South, at least so far as the Northern purse is con- 
cerned. Can the South pay their debts in money? It is conceded they cannot. 
What then have they beside their growing crops ? Twelve hundred millions in 
slaves. But these will not sell for a single dollar in our northern markets. We 
fear that there is too much truth in the assertion, that they cancel their debts by be- 
coming bankrupt. — Portsmouth Gazette.

The Public Lauds. 

A bill having passed the last Congress for the distribution of the net proceeds 
of the sales of Public Lands among the several States, in the proportion of their 
federal representative numbers, it may be well to show the relative claims of the 
two sections. The following tables were prepared from official documents, in 
January, 1841.

It appears, then, that of the 134 millions of dollars which the public lands in the 
States and Territories have cost, 33 millions are chargeable to the free states, and 
90 millions to the slave states. The 178,616,672 acres of land in the free states 
cost $33,233,510, or 19 cents per acre, while the 182,524,002 acres in the slave 
states cost $90,350,930, or 50 cents per acre. There is no justice, therefore, in 
dividing with the slave states, until the prodigious difference in the cost of their 
igmds and ours is equalized in some way or other. But the next table will show the 
slight prospect there is that this will ever be done. It gives the quantity of land 
originally owned by the United States, the quantity sold in the several States, north 
and south, the aggregate value, the price per acre in each State and in each section 
of country, and the quantity remaining unsold, January 1, 1841.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



This table shows, that while the lands of the north have produced, on an average, 
138 cents per acre, those of the south have averaged only 127 cents ; that the aggre* 
gate value of lands sold in the free state* is $72,214,932, while the aggregate ol the 
slave states is only $47,728,899 : that while the northern lands have already yielded 
218 per cent, of their cost, making a balance in their favor of $38,981,422, the 
southern lands have yielded but 63 per cent, of their cost, leaving a balance against 
ihem of $42,622,031, showing a money difference between the two parties of more 
than 80 millions of dollars. 

The next table will show, by contrast, the comparative growth of the two sec- 
tions at the present time ; from which it will appear evident that the inequality is 
continually becoming greater, and that while the growth of the free states advances 
in an increased ratio, that of the slave states is yearly lessening in proportion.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



From this it appears, that during the years 1833 — 6, called the years of specula- 
tion, the free states and territories sold 12 per cent, of their original lands, and the 
slave states and territories sold 11 per cent. In the four years of re-action follow- 
ing, the free states sold six per cent, and the slave states three per cent, of their 
original contents. But if we compare their sales respectively with the quantities 
of land now remaining unsold, we find that the free states sold in the last four years 
10 per cent, of the amount, while the slave states in the same years sold but four 
per cent. Iu the eight years subsequent to 1832, the free states sold a quantity 
equal to 30 per cent, of the amount now remaining, or about one-quarter of what 
was unsold at the end of the year 1832, while the sales in the slave states in the 
same time equalled but 11 per cent, of the quantity now remaining, or less than one- 
tenth of what was unsold at the end of 1832. In the year 1838, which is regarded 
as about an average year, the free states, excluding territories, sold three per cent, 
of their lands, and the slave states only one per cent. Of the sales in the slave 
states since 1836, amounting to 5,478,792, more than one half, 2,867,067 acres were 
sold iu the state of Missouri, nearly all, I believe, to free laborers, goiug therefore 
to hasten the period of revolution in that state, while it also shows that the future 
resources of the country in the public lands depend mainly on free labor. 

The land sold by Government in the free states may be regarded as all bought for 
cultivation, and exceeds by more than five millions the quantity now under cultiva- 
tion in the United Kingdom. The sales in the last eight year's are 31,758,666 acres, 
being only two and a quarter millions less than the land now cultivated in the 
island of Great Britain. Of this quantity, 10,06S,999 acres, or 31 per cent., were 
sold in the last four years, since the season of speculation was over ; which fact, 
taken in connection with the vast influx of emigration during the preceding four 
years, conclusively proves that a much smaller proportion of the land sales of that 
remarkable period, in these states, were- taken for speculation than is generally 
supposed. At the rate of sales of the whole eight years, the lands in these states 
would be entirely disposed of in less than twenty years ; and at the rate of the last 
four years, the whole would be sold in seventy-two years. 

The running down of the sales in the slaveholding country since the credit bubble 
burst, is very instructive, falling from seven and a-half millions in 1836, to a trifle 
over one million in 1840, and of that amount more than 60 per cent, was in Missouri, 
chiefly to free cultivators. The sales in the two new territories of the north, one 
of which began to be settled in 1835, and the other in 1838, showing in the whole 
but little over 54 millions of acres, exceed by 13 per cent, the sales in the whole 
south, (leaving out Missouri,) containing three times the quantity of land. 

We call upon the new states of the north-west to look where they will be twenty 
years hence, when their public lands will be nearly all sold, and the avails put into 
the national treasury, and divided among all the states, or expended for the com- 
mon benefit, while the new states of the south-west will be dragging along, at 
about one per cent, a-year, and will still have a hundred and tw r enty millions of 
acres under mortgage to pay one-half the proceeds to the Federal Government. Do 
you think they will be quiet ? No, certainly, here will be another source of con- 
tention between the north and the south, and another nullification war. Let us 
avoid, as far as possible, the multiplication of causes of controversy with the south, 
so that both they and we may be able to give undivided attention to the GREAT 
QUESTION. 

The effect of adopting the federal numbers as the basis of distribution, instead of 
the free population, may be seen by comparing the two columns in the census table 
for 1S40, marked Land Division and Free Division. The table is calculated upon a 
distribution of three millions annually. By adopting the federal basis, the slave 
states receive $190,496 more, and the free states $173,644 less, than equity allows, 
making a difference of $364,140. By taking this property basis, Maryland receives 
first a gratuity of one representative in Congress, and then a further gratuity of 
$3,260 yearly in money from the national treasury. The two adjoining states of 
Indiana and Kentucky, are now equal in political power — but of this public dona- 
tion, each free inhabitant of Kentucky will receive 22.2 cents and each free inhab- 
itant of Indiana but 18.8 cents. Perhaps it is a conceded point in all the west, that 
100 Kentuckians are equal in merit to 118 Hoosiers. _■_-.

American Wheat and English Corn Laws. 

Within a few months, the attention of philanthropists, on both sides of the At- 
lantic, has been drawn to a consideration of the English Corn Laws, as connected 
with the abolition of slavery in the United States. The only article of American 
production which Great Britain receives free from burdensome duties, is cotton, the 
growth of the Slave States, while grain, the growth of the free States, is burdened 
with heavy duties. Would she allow an open trade in grain, it would help the 
growth of the new states of the North West, and throw the whole influence of trade 
and of politics, in this country, into the hands of freemen, and in favor of free 
labor. 

The British corn law, as settled in 1828, by the act of 9 Geo. IV., c. 60, is one of 
the most ingeniously contrived schemes that can well be imagined, calculated to in- 
jure the grain-growing interests of other countries, and the grain-consuming portions 
of her own people, without, it is believed, a corresponding advantage to the agricul- 
tural interests, for whose benefit it was intended. The variable scale of duties, ris- 
ing as the price of grain falls, and falling as the price rises, is but little understood 
in this country. The " general average," as it is called, is declared every Thurs- 
day, at the exchequer; and is obtained by first finding the average of all the grains 
sold during the week ending on the preceding Saturday, at 150 of the principal towns 
and markets, and then taking an average of this with the five last preceding general 
averages ; and this last is the declared or general average for that week. When the 
declared average of wheat is 73s. or upwards per quarter of 8 bushels, the duty is Is.; 
and when the price is 52s. or under, the duty is 34s. 8d. ; the intermediate duties be- 
ing graduated by a scale, or tariff, as follows :

cy, and the rate per cent, of the duty.

The attempt to overrule the great and irreversible laws of trade, which strike the 
balance between demand and supply — or, in other words, to prevent fluctuations in 



AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



a market where the demand was constant and the supply variable — could not but 
fail. Twenty years ago it was considered that a deficiency of one-tenth in the har- 
vest would raise the price or wheat three-tenths, and a deficiency of one-third would 
treble the price. This thermometrical sensitiveness of the market increases, as the 
increase of population overpasses the increase of production. The yearly consump- 
tion of all kinds of grain in Great Britain is estimated at 52 million quarters, equal 
to 416 millions of bushels, or 15 bushels to eaeh inhabitant ; of which 13 millions of 
quarters, or 104 million bushels, being 3f bushels to each inhabitant, is wheat. The 
only country to which she can look, with advantage, for supplies, is the free North 
West. Here is at once an immense market for manufactures, and an unlimited capa- 
city for the production of wheat in return.

There is a great increase since, in the North West. The Hon. Henry W. Taylor, 
of Michigan, estimates the disposable surplus of wheat in that State alone, for the 
year 1841, at from two to two and a half million bushels, and he says the present po- 
pulation would easily raise five million bushels for sale if there was a steady mar- 
ket.

AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



Suppose England would agree to receive our wheat free of duty. Orders would 
be sent from this country for manufactures, that would set every wheel, and spindle, 
and hammer in motion. Immediately, the north-west states would be willing to 
tax themselves for the interest of the state debt, because they would see how taxes 
could be paid. Immediately the state stocks would rise, because the interest would 
be secured, with a certainty that the public works would be completed and ren- 
dered productive. The free manufacturing industry of England, and the free agri- 
cultural industry of the north-west, would be stimulated to the highest productive- 
ness, by the best of all encouragements — the hope of a fair reward. 

The demand for the public lands would pour a steady stream into the national 
treasury on the one hand ; to be met by a deeper current from the imports on the 
other, furnishing an adequate revenue for the completion of our harbor works and 
national defences. Our exports, no longer confined to a single staple raised by 
slaves, but drawn from the most productive of all branches of labor — the cultivation, 
by free hands, of a rich soil that costs next to nothing — would keep foreign ex- 
changes in a healthy state 5 new ties of mutual advantage, and new inducements to 
mutual justice, forbearance, and peace, would arise between two nations of common 
origin, from whose influence the world has so much to hope for ; our own manufac- 
tures would be left, under their present protection, to a healthy and natural growth 
with the growth of the country ; and our nation would be saved from another tariff 
controversy, to occupy and embitter the debates of another political generation. 



A Terrible Deed. 

In illustrating the desperate condition to which the lower classes in England are 
reduced through grinding poverty and scarcity of food, the London correspondent 
of the Boston Post relates the following occurrence, the bare perusal of which makes 
the blood run cold ; he says, however, that it is too well authenticated to be doubted. 

" One of the rules of the < Stockport Burial Society ' is, that if a member loses a 
child by death, the parents receive j£3 8s. 6d. for funeral expenses. At the late 
Chester Assizes, two married couples, whose average ages were only twenty-six, 
were indicted. Their names were Sandys — and one couple were charged with 
having administered arsenic to their child, by which they murdered it, and the others 
were charged with being accessories to the crime before and after the fact. The 
deceased, with whose murder they were accused, was thus awfully killed for the 
diabolical purpose of obtaining the sum of three pounds eight-and-sixpence from 
the Stockport Burial Society I" 

The Difference. — It is estimated that the English Corn Laws cause 20,000 
deaths annually, and the American Slave Laws 25,000. Which is worse ? 



The Spirit of Liberty. 

Soon after the close of the long French war in Europe, a boy was standing on one of 
the bridges that cross the Thames at London, with a number of small birds in a cage 
for sale. A sailor who was passing, observed the little prisoners fluttering about 
the cage, peeping through the wires, and manifesting their eager desire to obtain 
their liberty. He stood for some time looking at the birds, apparently lost in 
thought. At length, addressing the boy, he said, — 

" How much do you ask Tor your birds ?" u Sixpence a piece, sir," was the reply. 

" I don't ask how much apiece," said the sailor j " how much for the lot f I 
want all hands." 

The boy began his calculations, and found they came to six shillings and sixpence. 

" There is your money," said the sailor, handing out the cash, which the boy 
received with evident satisfaction at his morning's trade. No sooner was the bar- 
gain settled, than the sailor opened the cage door, and let the birds fly away. 

The boy, looking quite astonished, exclaimed, " What did you do that for, sir? 
See, you have lost all your birds now." 

1" I'll tell you why I did it," said the sailor. 1 1 was shut up three years in a 
French prison, as a prisoner of war, and I am resolved never to see anything in a 
prison that I can make free."

The Cedar Tree. 

Those abolitionists who have entered systematically upon the political warfare 
against slavery, have adopted for their emblem the Cedar of Lebanon. The print 
below, taken from the Pictorial Bible, is said to be an exact picture of one of these 
venerable trees, supposed to have stood from the days of King David. 

" The Righteous shall grow like a Cedar of Lebanon. — Psalm xcii. 12. 



THE CEDAR OF LEBANON. 

The Cedar is the emblem of Constancy, of Protection, of Renown, of Immortality. 

" JAMES G. BIRNEY.— When the Hickory of Tennessee, the Elm of New 
York, the Buckeye of Ohio, and the Persimmon of Virginia, shall have perished 
into oblivion, our serviceable, fragrant, and ever-enduring CEDAR shall stretch its 
sheltering arms over the nation, and tower aloft, as a memorial of virtuous deeds, 
and a witness to the latest ages that God loves the good, and them that honor him 
he will honor." 

Song. 

A song of the towering Cedar Tree, 

The emblem of the free ; 
Here's glorious success to his tall, proud crest, 

May it shade the Buckeye tree ! 
He hath stood in the wintry tempest's blast, 

No trembling fear showed he ; 
But firm he stood as the storm howled past, 

With his strong arms branching free. 

Chorus. — Then sing to the brave old Cedar Tree, 
Who shall rule in this land ere long ; 
Here's health and renown to his broad green crown f 
When the Buckeye tree is gone. 



AMERICAN ANTI SLAVERY ALMANAC. 



He saw the dark age, when popular rage 

Was a saddening sight to see, 
And church and hall, both large and small, 

Were shut in the face of the free ; 
And the night throughout, the maddening shout 

Was heard of the drunken train ; 
They, the vile and the base, shall die in disgrace, 

But the Cedar shall remain. 
Chorus. — Then sing to the brave old Cedar Tree, 

Who shall rule in this land so long ; 
Here's health and renown to his broad green crown, 

When the Buckeye tree is gone. 



Political Principles. 

The Anti-Slavery Almanac for 1839, which obtained universal currency among 
abolitionists in that day, laid down the principle as an axiom, " We will vote for 
no man who votes against liberty !" 

The great National Convention, of August 1, 1S39, at Albany, adopted the fol- 
lowing resolutions : — 

1. " Resolved, That we will neither vote for, or support the election of any man 
for President or Vice President of the United States, or for Governor or Lieutenant 
Governor, or any legislative office, who is not in favor of the immediate abolition 
of slavery. 

2. " Resolved, That every abolitionist who has a right to vote, be earnestly en- 
treated to lose no opportunity to carry his abolition principles to the polls, and 
thereby cause our petitions to be heard through the medium of the ballot-box. 

The following pledge is now recommended by the New- York Central Committee 
to be circulated by town committees, for the purpose of ascertaining how many 
voters may be depended on in elections : 

Pledge. — The undersigned, legal voters of the town of , believing that 

slavery is the greatest political evil in this nation, and that while it continues we 
cannot hope for permanent prosperity, do agree to unite our political power for its 
peaceful and constitutional overthrow ; and we hereby pledge to each other and the 
world our sacred honor to vote for the candidates of the Liberty Party for executive 
and legislative offices whenever that party nominate men of good character and 
suitable qualifications ; and in case that party should fail to nominate such candi- 
dates, we agree to vote for such persons only as will go to the extent of their con- 
stitutional power for the immediate abolition of slavery. 

Necessity. 

One crime creates a necessity for another ; but this very necessity aggravates 
rather than justifies the guilt it produces. A case : The colored steward of a steam- 
boat hears a white man abuse his captain, and call him a miserable, trifling fellow. 
The steward gives him the lie — the white man strikes him, and is struck in return. 
The negro is taken up and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, and the white 
man goes clear. " It is necessary," said the gentleman who told this — they could 
not get along in safety without such severity. Yes, it is necessary — and so, he that 
steals, finds it necessary to lie. 

Another case : — A minister of the gospel — we knew such a one — meek, pious, 
gentle, self-denying : he is a merciful master, and has been so educated that it never 
strikes him slavery is wrong. One of his negroes expresses his feelings in rather 
too manly a style, on being rebuked ; in o her words, is " impertinent." The mer- 
ciful man, the minister of Christ, draws off, and fells him to the earth with his fist. 
He never imagines that he is doing wrong — he sees that such acts are absolutely 
necessary, if he would maintain obedience among his slaves. Having once admitted 
the rightfulness of slavery, he must, by logical necessity, recognize as right what- 
ever is necessary to maintain it. If slaves are insolent, they must be whipped — 
else slavery must cease. If slaves run off, they must be whipped, stocked, or 
thumb-screwed, else slavery must cease.

In the Senate the north had a majority of two, (except from 1796 to 1802,) till 
1812, when the admission of Louisiana equalized the representation in that body. 
Still the north, having power to choose the Vice President, may have the casting 
vote. It follows that every act of the nation is an act of the free nation. They are 
virtually the nation. Whatever Congress does, or refuses to do, the final responsi- 
bility rests upon the free states. The only way to absolve ourselves from the 
guilt and shame of our national crimes is to discard those who perpetrate them, 
and choose men to represent us who will not vote down the foundation principles of 
our government. 

After the new apportionment, which will take effect in 1842, the representation 
on a basis of 60,000 will be, north 154, south 97 ; north majority, 57. On the ad- 
mission of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Florida, which will doubtless take effect in 1843, 
it will be 156 to 98 ; north majority, 58. The Senate will then stand, north 30, 
south 28 ; north majority, 2. The electoral vote will then be, north 186, south 126 ; 
north majority, 60 ! 



" To the Polls." 



BY SUSAN 

Father ! in a happy home, 
Smiling when thy children come, 
Clustering around thy knee, 
Wilt thou have those children free? 
Have them, one day, firmly stand 
On their " own," their " native land," 
Never for a single hour, 
Helpless slaves of tyrant power ; 
Have the proffer'd gifts of heaven, 

Chainless hand,unbranded brow, 
Ever to thy loved ones given ? 

To the polls ! — secure them now. 

Husband ! who each passing year 
Provest thy chosen one more dear, 
Think of many a deep felt trial, 
Uncomplaining self denial ; 
Torturing cares in silence borne, 
Smiles of love, forever worn ; 
All her warm heart's pure affection, — 
Every claim on thy protection ! 
Be her breast to fear a stranger ! 

Though the threat'ning Southrons come, 
Guard her from approaching danger, 

To the polls ! — protect her home. 



Brother, with a parent's care ! 
He who filled that vacant chair, 
He who watched thy early years 
With a father's hopes and fears, 
Left a sacred charge to thee, — 
Blooming youth and infancy •' 
Guard that precious charge from wrong ! 
Threat'ning ills around them throng; 
Though a darkening cloud is o'er thee, 

Heed it not J — serenely bright 
Is the narrow path before thee, 

To the polls ! — support the right. 

Freemen ! would you still be free ? 
As ye prize j^our liberty, 
As you wish your sons may stand 
With unfettered soul and hand ; 
As ye feel for those who've borne 
Undeserved reproach and scorn ; 
As ye do not seek to find 
Heavier chains the slave to bind ; 
As ye will not, lowly kneeling, 

Bend your own necks to the chain — 
Oh ! by every generous feeling, 

To the polls ! — ne'er pause again. 



A Church Sorely Bitten. 

The committee of funds of Old School Presbyterians, lately reported, forty three 
thousand three hundred and fifty four dollars, exclusive of the funds invested in the 
Vicksburg bank — as having been lost by the depreciation in the value of stocks, 
chiefly in the South and South West. The amount sunk in the Vicksburg Bank is 
supposed to be very large. So much for church investments among those who trade 
in the souls and bodies of men.

Relief for Sorrow. 

The following stanzas, by the late Rev. C. Wilcox, contain true philosophy, as 
well as poetry of surpassing beauty. 

Wouldst thou from sorrow find a sweet relief, 

Or is thy heart oppressed with woes untold? 

Balm wouldst thou gather for corroding grief? — 

Pour blessings round thee, like a shower of gold. 

Rouse to some word of high and holy love, 

And thou an angel's happiness shalt know — 

Shalt bless the earth, while in the world above : 

The good begun by thee shall onward flow, 

In many a branching stream, and wider grow ; 

The seed that in these few and fleeting hours, 

Thy hands unsparing and unwearied sow, 

Shall deck thy grave with amaranthine flowers, 

And yield the fruits divine, in heaven's immortal bowers. 



Education Maxims. 

The following maxims, from the Common School Almanac for 1842, will show 
where the strength and wealth and improvement of the country are found. Re- 
marks are added in brackets. 

Protection. — " Education," said Edmund Burke, " is the cheap defence of 
nations." 

[In the slave states, the mass of the people are uneducated, and the slave com- 
munity is unprotected.] 

Insurance. — Education is the great Insurance Company, which insures all other 
insurance companies. The safety of life and the security of property lie in the 
virtue and intelligence of the people ; for what force has law, unless there is intel- 
ligence to perceive its justice, and virtue to which that law can appeal. 

[Hence the insecurity of both life and property throughout the south, and the 
anxiety of slaveholders to remove their families and their capital to the north.] 

Agriculture. — The soil does not produce according to its natural richness, but 
according to the intelligence that works it. Therefore, the best manure farmers 
can obtain, is a good school for the district where their children are to receive the 
entire education. A good school will make the rich soil a blessing, and the barren 
one productive. 

[Who wonders that the soil of the south wears out, when " the intelligence that 
works it" is systematically reduced to the lowest possible degree ?] 

Government. — To govern men, there must be either Soldiers or Schoolmasters, 
Books or Bayonets, Camps and Campaigns, or Schools and Churches — the cartridge 
box or the ballot box. . • 

[The south is governed by the bowie knife and whip, and governs the north by 
the power of sectarian and party discipline.] 

Economy. — I would say, It is cheaper to educate the infant mind, than to sup- 
port the aged criminal. Yes, bestow the pence on common schools, and save the 
pounds on prisons. Man was not made to be sent to prison, but to be educated ; 
and " the very worst use you can put a man to is to hang him." 

[The next worst use of a man is to make him a slave ; for 
" Jove fix'd it certain that whatever day 

Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away." 

Unknown Laws. — The writer was once passing through a park and saw nailed 
to one of the trees, this warning : " All dogs found in this park will be shot." A 
friend who was with us, remarked, " unless dogs can read they are pretty badly off 
here." Now a man not able to read is worse off than the dog, for the dog has a 
master to read for him ; but man has no master between him and his God. 

[How dreadful the cruelty of making statutes, as is done in the slave states, to 
punish men who cannot read them, and how satanical the sacrilege of prohibiting 
man from learning to read the laws of his God.]

Fruits of Emancipation, 

The liberality of the freed Christians in the West Indies, in contributing money 
from their scanty resources for the furtherance of the gospel, is most remarkable, 
and may well attract the attention of those managers of benevolent societies in the 
United States, who are courting the patronage of a handful of slaveholders, forgetful 
of the time to come, when three millions of emancipated Americans will throng 
with their gifts to the treasury of the Lord. 

The following anecdote, related by a minister from the West Indies, at a mis- 
sionary meeting in England, is copied from the London Chronicle : 

" You will perceive a considerable increase in the income of the station during 
the past year. That increase has been chiefly owing to a great effort which the 
people are now making towards a new chapel. In many instances I was obliged to 
restrain their liberality. One incident occurred which 1 shall never forget. In 
calling over the names, to ascertain how much they could give, I happened to call 
the name of " Fitzgerald. Matthew." " I am here, sir," he instantly replied, and 
at the same time, I saw him hobbling with his wooden leg out of the crowd, to come 
up to the table pew, where I was standing. I wondered what he meant, for the 
others answered to their names without moving from their places. I was, however, 
forcibly struck with his apparent earnestness. On coming up, he put his hand into 
one pocket, and took out a handful of silver wrapped in paper, and said, with a 
lovely kind of abruptness, " That's for me, massa." " Oh," said I, "keep your 
money at present, I don't want it now, I only wanted to know how much you could 
afford to give ; I will come for the money another time." " Ah massa," he replied, 
" God's work must be done, and 1 may be dead,'' and with that he plunged his hand 
into another pocket, and took out another handful of silver, and said, " That's for 
my wife, massa." Then he put his hand into a third pocket, and took out a some- 
what similar parcel, and said, " That's for my child, massa," and at the same time 
giving me a slip of paper, which somebody had written for him, to say how much 
the whole was. It was altogether near j£3 sterling — a large sum for a poor field 
negro with a wooden leg. But his expression was to me worth more than all the 
money in the world. 1 have heard eloquent preachers in England, and have felt, 
and felt deeply under their ministrations ; but never have I been so impressed with 
anything they have said, as with the simple expression of this poor negro. Let me 
never forget it ; let it be engraven on my heart ; let it be my motto in all that I 
take in hand for the cause of Christ — ' God's work must be done, and I may be 
dead.' » 



Woman. 

Not she with trait'rous kiss her Saviour stung, 
Not she denied him with unholy tongue ; 
She, when apostles shrunk, could danger brave, 
Last at the Cross, and earliest at the grave. 



Public Opinion. 

Laws do not change opinion, but opinion changes Law. 

Public opinion is the Throne of a republic ; and it is eloquently and correctly said 
by M. de Tocqueville, that " the greatest despotism on earth is an excited, untaught 
public sentiment ; and hence, we should not only hate despots, but despotism." 

" When I feel the hand of unjust power, I care little to know who oppresses me ; 
the yoke is not easier, because it is held out to me by the hands of a million of men." 

The best means of correcting public sentiment, is to agitate it ; for " when thought 
is agitated truth rises." Therefore, let light, by means of the Press, and the living 
voice, be poured upon the public mind. 

We must agitate : for Reform, like a top, will fall as soon as we stop whipping. 

We have not only to strike while the iron is hot, but we must make the iron hot 
by striking.

" They can't talte care of themselves." 

Two slaves in Louisiana were let nut by their master, at a considerable distance 
from his own residence. They were skilful, intelligent mechanics, and of course 
he obtained high wages for their work. What time remained after their daily al- 
lotted tasks were finished, they were allowed to have for themselves ; and these 
precious hours they employed most industriously, with the view of purchasing their 
freedom. When they had accumulated, by patient toil, a sum which they deemed 
sufficient, they endeavoured to negotiate with their master; but without success. 
Again they went to work ; and after two or three years, were enabled to offer a sum 
so large, that they felt almost certain it would tempt him to accede to their wishes. 
But he found them too profitable to be lightly parted with ; moreover, whatever 
they had of property was in reality his. He might, with perfect impunity, have 
taken all their hard-earned wages, and kept them in slavery still, as thousands of 
slaveholders had done before him. But whether he doubted their having so much 
money as they pretended, or whether he was too honorable to steal more than ninety- 
nine hundredths of their earnings, I know not ; at all events, he would not listen to 
their proposition on any terms. 

Finding they could not purchase liberty, they wisely resolved to take it. The 
enterprise was a perilous one ; for through a long line of slave States, they must run 
the gauntlet of patrols, blood-hounds, lynchers, jail-keepers, and rifles — and if they 
reached the States called free, they must dodge constables and kidnappers, backed 
by the glorious Constitution. 

They were sufficiently intelligent and well-informed to understand the dangers 
they would incur, and to devise a most cunning method of avoiding them. 

They made themselves acquainted with a white beggar and made him offers large 
enough to secure his secresy. They dressed him in a handsome suit of clothes, and 
through his agency purchased a carriage and a fine span of horses. They brought 
the carriage to an appointed place, stood hat in hand while he entered, and then 
mounted outside, as footman and groom. Of course no patrol thought of challen- 
ging such an equipage ; and a white gentleman travelling through the country, at- 
tended by his servants, was welcome at all the inns. The obsequiousness of their 
manners was an admonition to their brethren in bonds. " Yes, massa," and " Cer- 
tainly, massa," were accompanied with the most profound bows, and spoken in the 
humblest tones. 

The trio arrived in Buffalo unmolested ; there the carriage and horses were sold ; 
aDd the white beggar paid handsomely for consenting to play the gentleman. 

The slaves passed over to Victoria's dominions, whence they wrote a very friend- 
ly letter to their whilom master, begging that he would feel no uneasiness on their 
account, as they were most comfortably situated. — l. m. c. 



Southern Paymasters. 

At a late anti-slavery convention in Hamilton county, Ohio, S. P. Chase, Esq., 
said he had endeavored to ascertain the amount annually lost by the counties of 
Hamilton, Clermont, and Brown, through the inability of southern planters and 
merchants to pay their debts, contracted for produce and merchandise sold to them 
on credit from those counties, and that so far as he could find data, the sum teas 
equal to the taxes paid by those counties. The Hon. Thomas Morris confirmed this 



statement, and said moreover, that it was in reality greater than the amount of 
taxes thus paid. The daily professional business of these gentlemen is extending 
to all these counties, and they have every facility to ascertain the fact 



In looking over the June number of the Knickerbocker, we perceive the names of 
delinquent subscribers are published, with the sums that are due from each. The 
whole sum due from such subscribers in the number before us, is $173, of which sum 
$145 50 is due from southern subscribers, which is more than five-sixths of the 
whole. It is believed that there are ten numbers of the Knickerbocker taken at the 
north, where there is one at the south. If so, then we have indebted ess from the 
south about 60 to 1.

Patriotism and its Reward, 



An Ohio paper gives the following piece of history, which may well make our 
Anglo-Saxon pride hide its head. 

" In the late American war with Great Britain, at the battle of Brownstone, in 
the year 1812, when the American soldiers were defeated and flying in every direc- 
tion from a savage foe, ensign Foster, of Williamsburg, Clermont county, discovered 
his friend, Capt.Boerstler, of the same place, wounded in the forehead with a small 
rifle ball, which had penetrated the skull, but had lodged on the dura mater. Cap- 
tain B. was sitting on a log, his horse killed, and he unable from his wound to make 

a retreat. At this moment Mr. B , who was slightly wounded in the wrist, 

came hurrying by on horseback, under the care of Col. , of the Chilicothe regi- 
ment. Ensign Foster, seeing this opportunity for the escape of his friend, Capt. 
Boerstler, seized him with herculean strength, and in an instant set him on the 

horse behind Mr. B . Mr. B. immediately became alarmed for his own safety, 

and began to cry, supposing the weight of the captain on his horse would retard his 
flight. Col. , who had the care of Mr. B., on seeing what had transpired, im- 
mediately drew his sword on Ensign Foster, who gave back, and Capt. Boerstler 
fell from the horse to the ground. At this moment, Capt. John, a man of color, the 
waiter of Gen. Finley, of Cincinnati, came in sight, making good his retreat oir a 

swift horse. On seeing the ignoble conduct of Col. and Mr. B., in refusing 

assistance to a wounded fellow soldier in the hour of danger, he became indignant, 
dismounted his horse at once, placed the captain in his saddle, and ensign Foster 
behind to assist him in securing his retreat, while he (Capt. John,) fled on foot. 
So the persons of whom I have spoken arrived safely at the fort. Capt. Boerstler, 
though his wound was not mortal, died in a short time, being killed by a drunken 
surgeon in attempting to extract the ball. 

All will be anxious to know what has become of Mr. B., and what has become of 
Capt. John. Mr. B.'s wound in the wrist being slight, he soon recovered, returned 
to his friends, by whom he was caressed and regarded as an honorable man, and a 
soldier who had braved the dangers of war, and fought the battles of his country. 
Nor did his country do him less honor. He has drawn a pension of ninety-six 
dollars per annum, to the amount of hundreds of dollars. He is now living in 
Clermont county, in the possessioff.of a good living, enjoying all the blessings of 
liberty. 

But where is Capt John, who so generously perilled his own life to save that of a 
fellow soldier? Did he return to his country crowned with military honors? He 
was denied a country. Was he pensioned by the General Government for his 
bravery on the battle field, and his generosity evinced in voluntarily giving up his 
own horse to save a fellow soldier, and trusting to his own fleetness for safety ? 
No \ He was one of those persons who, by the black acts of 1804 and 1807, are 
prohibited from settling in Ohio, unless they give a resident white security for their 
good behavior ! Ask a man to give security for his good behavior, who behaves 
himself as Capt. John did at the battle of Brownstown ! I 

In 18 — , when the doctrine held and taught by the Colonization Society, that ne- 
groes are fit only for missionaries, had been extensively propagated and generally 
believed, the self-styled guardians of the liberties of the people, in true mobocratic 
style, drove Capt. John, with hundreds of others, out of Cincinnati. As Capt. John 
was on his way from Cincinnati to Canada, he called at Williamsburgh, where he 
had an interview with the surviving friends of Capt. Boerstler, who advised him to 
give security for his good behavior, &c, to which he replied, " I will give no security 
in a country where I have fought its battles and am not even suspected of crime." 

The Greatest Man. 

The greatest man is he who chooses the right with invincible resolution ; who 
resists the sorest temptations from within and from without ; who bears the heaviest 
burdens cheerfully ; who is calmest in storms, and most fearless under menaces and 
frowns ; whose reliance on truth, on virtue, on God, is unfaltering. — Channing.

Testimony from Jamaica. 

The Hon. Edward Jordon, of Kingston, Jamaica, is a magistrate, a member of 
the Provincial Assembly, and one of the editors of the leading daily Journal. His 

Eosition is conservative, rather leaning to the planting interest ; so much, that he 
as been denounced by the ultra-abolitionists of the island as recreant to liberty. 
In a letter to the Rev. C. S. Renshaw, dated May 5, 1841, he makes the following 
statements in regard to the effect of emancipation. 

You ask, " is there any manifest improvement in the physical and moral con 
ditions of the rural population generally." My answer is, I think there has been a 
very manifest improvement in the physical and moral condition of the rural popula- 
tion of the island. The transition from slavery and apprenticeship, to unrestricted 
freedom, has been productive of the best effects. The increased pecuniary means 
of the people, has led to their increased comfort and happiness. They are better 
fed, clothed, and lodged, than they were. They have more time for rest, and to 
attend to their religious duties. Marriage is becoming, or has become more gen- 
eral among them, and altogether the effects of religious instruction appear to me 
more evident, than at any previous period. It is impossible to contrast the present 
and the past condition of the people generally, without being struck with the aston- 
ishing change that has taken place for the better. 
" What are the causes of the great falling off in the island staples ?" 
The demand for high wages on the part of the newly emancipated, which the 
employers would not consent to pay, together with the disputes about rent of houses 
and grounds, prevented the available labor of the colony from being applied to the 
extent it otherwise would have been. These disputes had scarcely terminated, 
when the drought set in. To these circumstances I attribute the falling off, which 
has been very considerable. 
" Has property generally appreciated, or only when broken into small lots?" 
It is not only when broken into small lots that the value of property has increased. 
Estates in the country, and houses in the towns, have since the abolition sold 
readily, and at higher rates than were ever expected. This, however, was the 
result of a large amount of compensation money being brought into the colony for 
investment, as well as the increased confidence produced by emancipation. 



Be Faithful unto the End. 

A German, whose sense of sound was remarkably acute, was passing by a church, 
a day or two after he had landed in this country, and the sound of music attracted 
him to enter, though he had no knowledge of our language. The music proved to 
be a piece ol nasal psalmody, sung in a most discordant fashion ; and the sensitive 
German would fain have covered his ears. As this was scarcely civil, and might 
appear like insanity, his next impulse was to rush into the open air. " But this, 
too, I feared to do ? " said he, " lest offence might be given ; so I resolved to en- 
dure the torture with the best fortitude I could assume j when, lo ! I distinguished 
amid the din, the soft, clear voice of a woman, singing in perfect tune. She made 
no effort to drown the voices of her companions, neither was she disturbed by their 
noisy discord ; but patiently and sweetly she sang in full, rich tones ; one after 
another yielded to the gentle influence ; and before the tune was finished, all were 
in perfect harmony." 

I have often thought of this story, as conveying an instructive lesson to reform- 
ers. The spirit that can thus sing patiently and sweetly in a world of discord, must 
indeed be of the strongest as well as the gentlest kind. Scarce can one hear his 
own voice amid the braying of a multitude ; and ever and anon comes the tempta- 
tion to sing louder than they, and drown the voices that cannot thus be forced into 
perfect time. But this were a pitiful experiment ; the melodious tones, cracked 
wto shrillness, would only increase the tumult. 

Stronger, and more frequently comes the temptation to stop singing, and let dis- 
cord do its own wild work. But blessed are they that endure to the end — singing 
patiently and sweetly, till all join in with loving acquiescence, and universal har- 
mony prevails, without forcing into submission the free discord of a single voice.' — 
Mrs. Child.

Principles of Christian. Fellowship. 

The Congregational Church in Canterbury, N. H., April 9, 1841, 

Resolved, That we cannot, conscientiously, extend the hand ^ r Chrsstian fellow- 
ship to churches that tolerate slaveholding in their members ; nor will we invite to 
our communion table, or into the pulpit, those who claim a right to hold property 
in man. 
, The Presbytery of Ripley, Ohio, May 7, 1841 , 

Resolved, That in the opinion of this Presbytery, the sin of slaveholding should 
be treated as any other sin, and therefore, that this Presbytery will not receive 
under its care, for the purpose of licensure, any person known to be guilty of this 
sin/ without satisfactory evidence of his having repented of it. And that ministers 
thus guilty, who may be received to this Presbytery by certificate from other Pres- 
byteries, be instructed, that we shall feel ourselves bound to pursue the same steps 
of labor and discipline, as in the case of any other similar offence ; and that the 
sessions of our churches be requested to act on the same principle in regard to the 
admission of members to their respective churches. 

The Baptist Association of Black River, N. Y., 1841, 

Resolved, That American slavery is sinful under all possible circumstances — 
essential ingredients are those flagrant violations of God's law and the rights of 
man which the Bible everywhere condemns, and- which, separate from slaver y, 
everywhere exclude those who are guilty of them from the pale of the christian 
church. 

Resolved, Therefore, that to exclude slaveholders from the pulpit and the com- 
munion table, is^to institute no new " test " — that the test is as old as Christianity, 
and identical with its most legitimate workings aud its most commonly received 
practices. 

The General Anti-Slavery Convention in London, June, 1840, on motion of Rev. 
John Angell James, 

Resolved, That this meeting, while it disclaims the intention or desire of dictating 
to Christian communities the terms of their fellowship, respectfully submits that it 
is their incumbent duty to separate from their communion dll those persons, who, 
after they have been faithfully warned in the spirit of tke? gospel, continue in the sin 
of enslaving their fellow creatures, or holding them in slavery — a sin, by the com- 
mission of which, with whatever mitigating circumstances it maybe attended in 
their own particular instance, they give the support of their example to the whole 
system of compulsory servitude, and the unutterable horrors of the slave trade. 



What has become of that Leather 1 

An industrious and careful citizen of the North, a tanner by trade, was arguing 
with an abolitionist, that he had no concern with slavery. 

Abol. How much did you lay up last year ? 

Tan. You know I could not lay up a great deal, I lost so much. 

Abol. How came you to lose so much ? 

Tan. I sold fifteen hundred dollars worth of leather to Mr. , the carriage- 
maker, on credit, and he failed, and I lost the debt. 

Abol. How came Mr. ■ lb fail? He has been considered a very industrious 

man and a good manager, neither intemperate nor extravagant? 

Tan. You know he sells his carriages chiefly at the South, where they always 
have to give long credits, and for four or five years it has been so difficult to collect 
debts in Mississippi and Alabama, and the exchanges have been so bad, that it has 
used up all his capital, profits, credit; and everything, and he can't pay me a cent 
for my leather. 

Abol. But what makes it so difficult to collect debts at the South? Why don't 
they work harder and live closer, when it comes hard times, as we do, and so pay up ? 

Tan. I see what you are driving at. It is all owing to slavery. I understand 
now, that the fifteen hundred dollars is my tax for this year to support slavery. 

Abol. Just so.
