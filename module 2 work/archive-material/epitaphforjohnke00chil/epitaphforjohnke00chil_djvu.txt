JOHN KENRICK, Esq. 

Aged 77 Years. 



He was laborious, honest, and frugal. 

Though possessed of wealth, 

He loved not money, but loved his fellow men : 

Rigidly sparing in self-indulgence, but bountiful to others. 

He was a benefactor to the needy and unfortunate ; 

To the funds for the poor of this his native town. 

And to benevolent societies and Christian charities every where. 

To the temperance reformation he was an efficient and devoted friend. 

Early impressed with the unlawfulness, impiety and inhumanity of Slavery, 

And its peculiar incompatibility with republican government. 

He strove long and unassisted to awaken his countrymen to the subject: 

He wrote often and persuasively for the press ; 

He republished gratuitously the writings of others ; 

And if there had been " ten " like him in these States, 

The stain of slavery would not have darkened another Star 

In the North American Constellation. 

A forerunner of Abolition, he was a liberal benefactor 

Of the first Society formed for that object in our country. 

And died its presiding officer. 

He believed that goodness consists in doing good. 

And that the truest homage of Almighty God 

Is a reverent imitation of his blessed works. 

He was born November 6, 1755, 

And died March 28, 1833. 

His grateful children have placed this marble over his remains.
