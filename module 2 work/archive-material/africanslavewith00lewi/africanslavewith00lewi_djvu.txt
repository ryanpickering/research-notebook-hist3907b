TO- MY HEADERS. 



Encouraged by the favourable reception of the first 
Number of my Poems, from my generous Friends and 
the Public, I again take the liberty of claiming their 
indulgence ; and trust they will be kind enough to 
pardon me for obtruding upon their notice a second 
Number. Well am I aware that these Poems are not 
the productions of sovereign genius. No^ — they are 
only the effusions of a mind possessed of some of the 
peculiar feelings of human nature; and I shall be highly 
gratified, should the ideas tliey suggest impart half the 
energy and glowing enthusiasm which I felt when com- 
posing them. The discrimination of my Readers will 
readily point out the inaccm-acies that may occur 
in these pages ; but I hope they wiU accompany their 
censure with moderation and candour; — ^nor give way to 
those censorious reflections that are too often the re* 
suit of insensibihty and ignorance. I can estimate, 
according to their true value, obligations of friendship ; 
and for these obhgations, which have been many, gra- 
titude and sincerity bid me return my warmest ac^ 
knowledgment.

THE AFRICAN SLAVE. 



«* See the poor natire quit the Lybian slioTes, 

Ah ! not in love's delightful fetters bound ; 

No radiant smile his dying peace restores ; 

Nor love, nor fame, nor friendship, heals the w(Jund.^* 

3HENST0NE. 



Generous, philanthropic Britons, 

Sons of sacred liberty ; 
Deign to hear a Slave's narratioij. 

Doomed to want and misery. 

List to poor Moranza'^s story, 
Bom a prince on Afric's soil. 

Now a western Indian island. 
Hears me sigh, and sees me toU. 

A 



Bara's groves and green savanna's 
Own'd me once their honoured lord ; 

There, I liv''d in ease and freedom. 
Plenty daily crowned my board. 

There, first I saw the dear Almayda, 

Lovliest maid of Bara's vale ; 
Her form, the tallest pine surpassing. 

Her breath, more sweet than balmy gale. 

Long with love''s soft cares I w0o'd her ; 

Oft my sighs confessed the same; 
Won at last, my matchless maiden 

Own'd a tender, mutual flame. 

Afric's simple sons of Nature, 
Pay no vows at Hymen's shrine ; 

Now the day was fast approaching. 
When she promised to be mine. 



11 

In the interim, from Old England, 
Scudding brisk before the gale. 

Her white canvass, high displaying, 
We descried a merchant's sail. 

Gambia's stream received the stranger 5 
All her crew on shore did rove ; 

The Captain, with his matss attending. 
Came, by chance, to Bara's grove. 

Warm'd by Nature's friendly icta ^ 
We request our guests to stay ; 

And with pure, unfeigned kiftdness. 
Treat them till returning day. 

Glorious, genuine, simple nature, 
Tho' unknown in Christian land. 

Ne'er may I forget thy precepts ; 
May thy law my will command. 



I 

u 

Europe, fam'd for arts ajid learniiig> 

Cease on Afric's sons to frown. 
Christian whites, can do some actions 

Afric^s black's would scorn to own. 

Soon, as mountain tops were gilded 

WiUi the beams of orient day, 
Up arose the faithless strangers, 

And prepared to go away. ' 

First, the smooth tongu'd, fiatt'ring Captain^ 
With a heart deep fraught with guile, 

Spoke to me with well-feigned kindness. 
And addressed me with a smile. 

^< Prince,'' said he, " you'd do me honour^ 
If you, and your beauteous bride, 

Would attend us to our vessel. 
Floating now on Gambia's tide, 



IS 

«« Various wonders we will shew you. 
Brought from Britain's far-fam^d coast ; 

Works of Britain's wond'rous artists^ 
Who the world may fairly boast." 

Innocent, and unsuspecting. 

Soon were we entic'd away ; 
IVith a train of vassals round us, 

Forth we marcKd in fair array. 

Soon we reach'd proud Gambia's margin; 

Broad and deep the stream did ghde ; 
Boats were ready to convey us 

To the lofty vessel's side. 

But, O Britons f blush to hear it. 
Blush at such detested wrong, 

Gn the deck we straight were seized^ 
And confined with irons strong. 



14 

All, but my belov'd Almayda, 
Shar'd this fate — -and she to sai-e 

Life, and pure unsullied virtue, 
Plung'd into the Gambia's wave 

That base fiend, the British Captairi^ 
Mad that he should lose his prey, 

Snatch'd a gun, replete with murder^ 
Death it quickly did convey. 

Thrice she call'd on her Moranz^, 
Thrice she bade a long adieu ; 

Then my injured, much lov'd angel 
Sunk for ever from my view. 

Mad with rage, and desp'rate driven, 

Franticly, I oft essay'd, 
My strong chains to burst asunder. 

And to follow that lov'd mdd. 



15 

'Twas in vain ; tli' infernal eaptain 
Saw my aim, and quickly flew 

To prevent my fix^d intention^ 
And in loathsome hold me threw* 

There, I suffered evVy hardship-. 
That their malice could suggest^. 

Many weeks this was my portion, 
IS'ight and day deprived of rest 

When those lawless sons of rapine^ 
Their inhuman trade had clos''dy 

To Jamaica's distant island. 

Straight to sail, was then proposed. 

Who can scan the heart-felt anguish, 
That mj throbbing bosom tore ? 

When I found the vessel steering, 
From my much loV'd native shore. 



IG 

Oft I cryM, adieu, dear Bara, 

Dearest Negro-land, adieu ; 
Never more will poor Moranza, 

Your lov''d. scenes again review. 

Farewell bright, angelic spirit. 

Shade of my adored maid ; 
All my hopes of joy are blasted,. 

And in Gambia's river laid. 

Dear companions of my childhood^ 
Eriend s, and countrymen, adieu ; 

O may no fierce. Christian, hhod^hoimd^ 
Your unwary steps pursue. 

Soon, I hope, will death's kind angel 
Snatch me from their stern command : 

Then, with joy my well-pleas'd spirit 
Will return to Negro-land. 



IT 

Long we ploughed a trackless ocean, 
Ere we reach'd our destin'd port ; 

Many dangers we encountered; 
Long of waves, and wind the sport. 

But no pen can paint the hardships, 
We poor slaves were doom'd to feel ; 

To recount what we endured, would 
Touch a heart, tho' hard as sted. 

Numbers cram'd in narrow compass^ 
Chained in rows hke beasts of prey; 

Far removed from cooling breezes, 
Quite shut up from hgivt of day. 

Inly, torn with wild commotions. 
Frighted for our future fate^ 

Sighing for our friends, and countrT^ 
Pining at our present state. 



u 

This is but the shadow'd outline^ 

Of a truly tragic tale ; 
Silence, then, must draw the picture, 

When thy powers, description, fail. 

At the last, we reach'd JPort RoyaL 
Where, secure our vessel lay. 

There, we changed our eruel tyrants. 
Other tyrants to obey. 

An old planter void of pity, _ 
Purchased me, and sundry more. 

For to work on his plantation. 

That lay bordering with the shore. 

Incessant toil is here my portion, 
Doomed to work with all my might. 

From the ruddy dawn of morning, 
Tq the dusky shades of night. 



19 

Ev'n when wish'd for eve approaches. 

No relief it brings to me, 
Save, that I have leave to ponder 

UndisturVd, on misery. 

Often from my hut I wander, 

Guided by the lunar beam. 
To recount my nameless sorrows. 

Near a murmuring, neighboring streate. 

Oft, does my disordered fancy. 
Bring before my aching sight. 

My beWd, ador'd Almayda, 
Drest in robes of orient light. 

Quick I spring to clasp my charrner. 

To embrace the peerless fair. 
But alas ! the joy-form'*d vision 
' Danishes in empty aii'. 



N 



20 

Though unable oft to stagger. 
Sighs and tears are all in vain ; 

No exemption, I must labour, 
Dig the soil, and plant the cane. 

Generous, philanthropic Britons ! - 
Ye who boast the feeling breast. 

Can you hear unmoved, my story. 
And not feel for the distrest ? 

Yes you do; and heaven will bless you; 

You have strove to set us free ; 
Your exertions claim the thanks of 

Thousands, thousands more than me. 

*Mongst those names that grace their species, 

Names that ^vill forever shine ; 
That which claims our first attention, 

Glorious Wiiberforcej His thine.

TWO RIVEES OF THE SOUTH. 

A CANTATA, 

Written on the Marriage of Captain Ord of 
Longridg-e, to Miss Isabella Sharp of Hod-^ 
dam Castle. 

hecitative. 
Amongst those hills whence Tweed and Annan risCj 

A humble bard sat pensive all alone ; 
When lo ! upon his musing, wondering eyes. 

The spirits of the streams in beauty shone. 

Fan- Tweed was deck''d with wreaths of laurel green^ 
And (Sive, emblem of sweet peace combinM; 

In modest garb was lovely Annan seen, 

A sprig of myrtle her bright brow entwined. 



22 

« Gentle sister of the spring,*" 

Smiling Tweed with joy exclaimM, 

«< On this happy day lefs sing, 
May this day for mirth be fam^d. 

Hymen, sacred God of marriage, 
Promised soon to meet us here, 

Cupid too attends his carriage, 
Loves and graces in the rear, 

Kejoice with me my charming sister, 
O may y^ars of bhss succeed ; 

On this day, the flower of Annan 
Joins my Ord, the pride of Tweed.'^ 

Am.— -Tune, Blrks of hvoerm^y. 
Tliou glorious sun, whose radiant ray 
The sable shades of night obey ; 
On tliis blest day propitious shine, 
When native w^orth and beauty join. 



Thy potent beams, bright orb of daj^ 
That light and heat to all convey. 
Ne'er shone on pair which can exceed 
Fair Annan's llov/V, and pride of Tweed. 

Hail, worthy, happy, peerless pair ! 
Long may you prove heav'ns guardian eare i 
May Ord be Tweed's first favVite name. 
And Sharp still shine in rolls of fame : 
May virtuous deeds your worth convey 
To latest hour of life's decay. 
Yes, honour'd names — fate has decreed 
That you're to shine, the pride of Tweed. 

RECITATIVE. 

Inspir'd by Tweed's enraptur'd theme. 
The gentle Annan, artless dame, 

For once assay'd to sing. 



m 

In simple, unaffected strains, 

Tq fancy's pow'r she gave the reins, 

To please the classic spring, 

AiR.-^Tune, Eoj/'s Wife of AldivcdlocJi. 
Chonis, 

Bonny lass of Annan water, 
Sweetest maid of Annan water ; 
Whi9> can excel my Isabell, 
My blooming flowV of Annan water. 

Bear Tweed, receive my charming maid ; 

Long may your Ord adore and daut her. 
May future verse her praise rehearse. 

Though distant far from Annan water. 

Let distant bards strange beauties, praise, 
Believe me tjiat they only flatter ;

For worth tHat'^s rare, and beauty fair. 
Is only found near Annan water. 

Bonny lass of Annan water,. 
Sweetest maid of Annan water ; 
Who can excell my Isabella 
My blooming flower of Annan water. 



At the end of the song. Hymen and Cupid descend from hn 
•therial chariot drawn by turtle doves, attended by the Virtues, 
Loves, and Graces, who form a circle round the guardian sj^ixits of 
the rivers, who are addressed by Hymen as follows : 



BTXITATIVE 

Fair guardian of the far fam'd banks of Tweed, 
And thou bright spirit of thy A nnan^s stream'p^ 
WeVe left your Scotian capital with speed. 
Conveyed on chariot formed of solar beams. 
This day Fve joined in wedlock's silken chain 
Two hearts, wliich by such bands are seldom tied. 



26 

I know, dear Tweed, tliat Ord's thy fav'iite swain, 
And Annan claims the young, the blooming bride. 
Joy to the pair, long may their joys encrease. 
And all their future days be crown'd with love and 
peace.

Of Annan, Tweed, and £i that.

Sweetest maid of Annan's banks. 

Gently gliding, winding Annan ; ^ 



Dearest maid of Annan^'s banks^ 
Sweet flower of winding Annais.

Of thy bright gem bereft thee, G ; 

For a cockade thy charRiIng maid^ 

Alas }X)or thing, has left thee, O- 

DuTing the three last songs, the attendant spirits join in chorus 
and form a rural dance around Cupid, Hymen', and the guardian 
angels of the Tweed and Annan. At the /cojaclusion of the dance, 
the whole group the humble bard, and his humbler verses incju*- 
ded «' vanish into enxpty air."

ELEGY 

0)1 a young Gentleman zcJio died at Angoleu On the 
coast of Africa. 

Why reigns that sadness o'er fair Annan's plains ? 

What sounds o£ grief proceed from every vale? 
How pensive look the nymphs, and once gay swains^ 

Sure^ 'tis produced by some disast'rous tale.. 

*' Too true indeed," reply'd a. hoary sage^ 
" The fatal cause we ever must deplore ; 

The pride of youth, the hope of helpless ag€» 
The lov'd Leander is, alas ! no more. 

In earlv youth, we saw his growing worth, 
We mark'd improvement in his rising years r 

"^ut ah! when manhood's rip'ning buds shot forth. 
He bade adieu— and left us all in tears. 



With min'd illum'd, by Science' fairest light. 

For wisdom op'd to him her ample store. 
And bade him, (to improve his genius bright) 

-Go search for knov/ledge on a foreign sjhore.^ 

The sacred mandate, he with joy obey'd, . 

And left his loy'd Britannia'a native strand; 
Across th' Atlantic waves was swift conveyM, 

And landed safe on Afric's burning sand. 

Angola's torrid scenes salute his eyes, 
Each novel object he with joy surveys ;^ 

A numVous train of wonders he descries, L 

And 'midst a, lab'rinth of dehght he strays. . 

is the sagacious, humming, busy bee. 

From flow'r to fiow'r incessantly doth roam. 

Extracting sweets, in hopes, (with heart-felt glee) 
To bear the produce to his native home. 



so 

So toiPd Leander, 'aciidst these burning plains', 
Extracting knowledge from each shrub and flow V^ 

In hopes the labour would reward his pains,. 
And prove his solace when his toils were a'ep.. 

But ah ! how short-liv'd are our promisM joys^ 
How soon our fairest, brightest hopes decay; 

Like, airy bubbles^ blow n by giddy boys, ^ 

They burst — and mere non-entity display. 

Contagion, arm'd with death''s remorseless dart, 
Arreats Leander, 'midst his visions gay ; 

The poison''d shaft transfix''d his throbbing hjeart> 
And mix'd our darling with the mouldVing clay. 

Lamented youth, far from thy native home,. 

]So pious hand, perhaps, to close thine eyes. 
Far from tny liinclred, and paternal dome, 

'Mongst barVrous nations thou unpity'd dies. 



u 

Yet leaver shall thy memorj be forgot, 
While hardy Britons stem the stormy Siea, 

Each gen^'ous tar will view the sacred spot, 
And drop a tear^ dear friendly youth, for thee. 

Tho^ far lov'd youth, far from tliy kindred dust, 
On Afric^s plains thy body lowly lies, 

Yet thy immortal part we hope and trust. 
Associates now with -angels 'bove the skies. 

Then cease, ye parents, relatives so dear, 

Far from your breasts may undue grief be driven 

For he for whom you shed the friendly tear, 
Now reigns a happy, joyous saint in heaven. 



THE AMICABLE BROTHEES, 

A CANTATA, 

*♦ Dulce pro patria mori." 

HORACi,. 
EECITATIVE. 

As fam\d John Bull once walked liis; usual round, 
His three lov'd brothers o'er a bowl he found ; 
Brave Sandy, born near source of winding Taj, 
And Patrick, sprung from fair Hibernian clay ; 
With honest Shon-ap-Morgan, Shinkin Shones, 
(Cot splut her nails ! Glamorgan rear d her bones), 
*' Well met, (cry'*d John) my heroes stout and true, 
IVe traversal half the tow^n in seeking you ; 
Straiige news IVe got — -but come, lef s have a swdg.

When he had drank, and forward drawn his chair^ 
His premised new^s in song he did declare.

Gasconading France, my lads^ 
Has threatened to invade us ; 
Sam-Culottes in whole brigades. 
Swear, under foot they'll tread us. 

Chorus. 
But, if concord bind our lands. 
We soon will homeward chace them ; 
And teach those vile frog-eating bands^ 
That British boys dare face them. 

Oft have France's frighted fields 
Beheld our lion roar. Sir; 
And oft have British swords and shields^, 
Been stain'd with Gallic gore, Sir. 

Chorus, 

And still, if concord bind our ands, 

We homeward 'gain will chace tlaem^

And teach those vile frog-eatmg han 
That British lads dare face them. 

Camperdown and Lagos bay. 
Can tell how foes were frighted ; 
All their honour's fled away, 
eiThr boasted laurel's blighted, 

CJl07'US. 

Oh 1 let us then, like Duncan fight, 
Like Jervis learn to quell them ; 
Then France will find for all her might, 
That Britons can repel them. 

Come then, brothers, ere I go, 
And give me your opinions ; 
Shall we fight the daring foe, 
Or yield up our dominions .?

' Chorus. 

N05 let concoi'd bind our lands, 
And soon we^ll homeward chace them ; 
And teach those vile frog-eating bands, 
1 hat British lads will face them. 

RECITATIVE. 

1 lie Scotian hero, with the tidings stung, 
Grasped his claymore, and from tlie table sprung 1 
His eyes indignant flashed with martial flame, 
His heart beat high for his lov'd Scotia's fame 5 
With manly warmth the trio he addi'essed. 
And thus the ardour of his soul confessed :

Chorus. 
Such was tlieir love of hberty, their country and 

their laws, 
That, like their noble ancestors, they stood for 

freedom''s cause ; 
They boldly fought, like heroes bright, for honour 

and applause, 
And defy'd the Roman legions to alter their laws.''* 

Thy stones, Aberlemno, and history can tell, 
How the arms of our fathers their foes did repel. 
And Loncarty's plains will through ages convey, 
Our ancestors' fame, and the glory of Hay. 



Chorus. 
Such was their love of hberty, their country and 

their laws, 
That, like their valiant ancestors, they stood for 

freedom's cause ; 
They boldly fought, like heroes bright, for honour 

and applause. 
And defyM the northern Vandals to alter ther laws. 

Then ne'er let the sons of old Scotia despair, 
For Freeaom, blest Freedom, still deigns to reign 
there; 
* Beneath her bright banners fresh laurels we'll gain, 
And despise the bravadoes of both France and Spain. 

Chorus. 
Such is our love of liberty, our country and our laws. 
That, hke our noble ancestors, we'll stand by Free- 
dom's cause ;

The brave Hibernian to his brother run,^ — 
Arrah ! my joy ! (said Pat) give me your hand, 
I'll fight till I can neither go nor stand ; 
Should these French dogs but dare toboard this isle,

Then arrah 1 my jewels, well get a fine prize. 
When we strip all their dead men as fast as they rise, 

Cliorus, 
Sing Balinamona, ora, &c. 
A dear French invasion for m5. 

To be sure, d'ye hear me, one thing you must miod.

If e'er she gets sight of these bloody Monsieurs, 
She'll cut off hur head, and shell preak all hur bones, 
If hur lands in the country of Shinkin-ap-Shones. 



41 

Hiir piood is unmixed with the Saxon or Dane^ . 
'Tis pure ancient British, without spot or stain ; 
Hur'^s sprung from ancestors as old as the stones. 
Then who dare compete with great Shinkin-ap- 
Shones. 

For freedom hiir fathers forsook the green vales, 
And fled to the wild rugged mountains of Wales j 
Then think not, dear brothers, that Shinkin-ap- 

Shones 
Will yield hur dear freedom to Frenchmen or Dons. 

RECITATIVE . 

John Bull, with pleasure sparkling in his face, 
Ciasp"'d each lov'd brother in a warm embrace ;— • 
*' Bravo, my lads ! while thus we four agree, 
Britannia will prove sov'reign of the sea. 
Let's fill the bowl — and then in concert sing,- 
Long life and health to George our gracious king,"'

THE IdUSE IN A PASSION. 

Addressed to Mr James Macgill, near Wigio?i^ 
Galloway. 

My honestj worthy frien"', Macgill, 
I hope ye winna tak'' it ill. 
That I employ my rustic quill 

To write to you ; 
For faith Fm forc''d against my will ; 

'Tis true I vow.; : 

About the hour o"* twal last nigdt.

My hearf s still duntin^ wi' the fright,

I doubt I winna be sae right I 

This mony a day, - • 



43 

Tiie moon shone bright, I was na winking 
But thrang about auld langsynes thinking 
When quick I heard the door gang chnkia', 

Thinks I, what's that ? 
When lo ! I heard a fit come jinkin' 

Full pat for pat. 

A tattered damsel, pale and lean, 
Wr hair dishevelFd and red een, 
Cam to the bed, and cry"'d « Gude e'en ! 

Wr hollow tone ; 
Thinks I, what can that spectre mean ? 

I doubt I'm ffone.

I sain'd myseF tlu'ough perfect fear. 

Then fault'ring spoke, ^ Hail ! mistress dear, 

I wonder what ye can want here. 

Or what's your grudge ; 
I never murder'd ane, I swear. 

As God's my judge,'

^' Silence, thou senseless, sakeless snool. 
Thou poor hen-hearted worthless tool^

Poor snivlin tyke. 

" Oft have I strove wi' a' my might 
To raise thy saul, poor low-lif 'd wight. 
Far, far aboon th' illiterate height 

Of rustic swains ; 
And yet I've got nought but the slight 

For a' my pains.

*' Isa faith ! thou'dst rather clout auld claes^

Aboon the cluds. 

*' Degenerate wretch — when thou wast young, 
Thy verses roun* a' Burnswork * rung,

And to the door awa' she reel'd ; 
Straight o'er the bed I got, and kneel'd 

On the cauld stanes. 
And cry'd, " stop ! I yield, I yield," 

Wi' dismal granes. 

She looked back—." Bright Muse," said I, 
" O ! never from thy Lewis fly. 
Few friends I have beneath the sky. 

But thee, dear maid.

ELEGIAC STANZAS, 

On the Death of a Ninth Child^ and at the. time 
an wily Son^ 



Thy task i^ o'er, sweet babe thouVt fled> 
And left thy fragile, earthly home ; 

Yet oft thy father's heart-felt lays. 
Shall deck thy early, infant tomb. 

With thee is fled each aerial schem^^ 
Thy fondj thy doating father di*ew ; 

With thee is fled each rising hope, 
W^hich time again can ne'er re_ne^v: 



55 



In fancy's eye, I saw my child, 

Progressive rise to manhood''s day ; 

Methouglit I saw liis mind illum'd. 
With wisdom's piercings potent ra}-, 

i fondly dreamt, when hoary /ige 

Had graced my head with silver hair. 

My boy might then have been my prop, 
And smoothVl my -vmnkled brow of care. 

Illusive dreams, alas ! you're fled ; 

.Remov'd is every fancy 'd joy ; 
My last, bright gleam of hope's interred^ 

With thee, my darling infant boy. 

Vain man, how futile are thy schemes ! 

How transient are thy prospects gay ! 
Thy brightest views of bliss oft fade. 

Quick as the meteor's transient rav. 



5^ 

Adieu, ye fleeting, flatf ring dreams ; 

Farevrell each vain, terrestrial joy ; 
My joys, my hopes, alas, are fled 

With thee, my infant, darling boy. 

Alas ! my boy, too soon thou'rt gone^ 
And left thy fragile, earthly home ; 

Yet oft thy father's heart-felt lays 
Shall deck his William's early tomb. 



THE WANDERING STRANGER. 

-t* AR from each dear domestic scene ; ^ 
From each lov'd object torn away ; 

Far, far, from Annan's dear lov'd banks. 
I pensive, sad, and sighing stray 



57 

Still musing on my wayward fate^ 

Through unknown lands I joyless roanij 

No hand to help, no tongue to cheer. 
Or call the wandering stranger home» 

Tho' guiltless of intended crimes, 
Yet not, perhaps, from censure free, 

I bade my native vales farewell, 
And left a land too good for me. 

Now sad, forlorn, and lost, I rove, 
No pitying friend, no social dome, 

No generous heart to soothe my griefj 
Or call the wandering stranger home. 

Ye happy sons of wealth and power. 
Who bask in fate'*s propitious beams, 

Vv^ho never saw misfortune frown. 
Who never felt her sad extremes, 

E 



58 

While round the festive board you sit. 
Where circling goblets sparklingToam 

Ah ! think what grief the heart assails 
Of the poor stranger far from home. 



AN EPIGRAM. 

•A. bard went a courting one night, as I'm told, 
(For the bards are to courting inclin'd) 

He'd something forgot, you may swear 'twas not gold, 
No— he'd left his dear snijff-box behind. 

Enrag'd at the want of his cephcdk dose, 
Not a word could he speak that was civil, 

But rummag'd his pockets, and rubbed his nose. 
With looks would have frightened the d— L

To the shades getyougone! I'dprizeraore inmy arms,

l>rooping and sad o'er the tomb of her lovei*^ 
Poor Mary hurig weeping and wild with despair, 

In maniac fancy, she saw round her hover^ 
The pale sheeted spectre of Henry St Clair I 

<^ O stay'' she exclaimed, '^ thou pale ghost of my

« Reheve me, relieve me, from anguish and care ; 
" Ah no — see he flies from his heart-broken Mary ;

Blanch'd was her cheeky, once so ruddy and fair ; 
The beam that once sparkled forsook her bright eye. 
She died on the grave of young Henry St Claii*.

GRATITUDE. 

Addressed to Mi's Lumsdjine, EdiiihuTgh Castle, 

To God, that great power whom we all must adore. 

Our gratitude surely is due ; 
Our parents demand our most partial regard,^ 

Next our friends — I mean friends such as you.

To acknowledge a debt that is diie; 

^Tis gratitude, O ! how my bosom dilates,

ANNAN'S WINDING STREAM. 

Tune, Gramachree, 

On Annaii''s banks, in life's gay morn, 

I tun'd my " wood notes wild,'^ 
I sung of flocks and flow'ry plains. 

Like nature's simple child. 

Some talk'd of wealth, I heard of fame^ 

But thought 'twas all a dream ; 
For dear I lov'd a village maid, 

by Annan's winding stream. 



64 

The dew-bespangled, budding rose. 

The garden's flow"*ry pride, 
Was ne^'er so blooming, nor so fair^ 

As she I v/isk'd my bride. 

The sparkling radiance of her eye 
Was bright as Phasbus' beam ; 

Each grace adorned my village maid^ 
By Annan'^s winding stream. 

Dread war's shrill clarion fiercely blew^. 
The sound alarm'd mihe ear. 

My country's wTongs calFd for redres%; 
Could I my aid forbear .? 

Ko — ^^soon in martial garb array'd. 
With arms of brightest gleam^. 

I sigh'd and left my village maid^. 
By Annan's winding streanii 



6B 

When gentle peace again returns 
With all her smiling train, 

ril quit, with joy, the gay parade, 
And canvass-cover'd plain. 

Ill seek the vale that gave me birth, 
The vale I most esteem ; 

And haste to clasp my village maid. 
By Annan's winding stream.

1 E sons of verse, ye favoured few, 

Whom friendship's ties this night combine, 
Behold that face * so much rever'd, 

Witli laurel wreaths that brow entwine ; ' 
A name to genius ever dear, 

Departed, great, immortal Burns ; 
^gain returns thy natal day. 

But Scotia^s bard no more returns. 

Cease, throbbing hearts, cease, falling tears, 

Alas ! what can your grief avail ? 
The bard who taught you first to feel, 

Now sleeps in death's dark, dreary vale. 
Peace to his shade, fame crown his grave. 

While feelings in your bosoms burn ; 

* Alluding to rhe Portrait hung up in the roojn where the An- 
niversary was held.

With reverence hail the natal day 
Of him who never can return. 

While Caledonia's thistle waves. 

While Scotia's genius pours her song; 
So longj sweet bard to nature true, 

So long shall time thy fame prolong. 
Yes, Coila's heav'n-taught son of song, 

Each feeling heart will deck thy urn ; 
And hail with joy, the natal day. 

Of him, ah ! gone ne'er to return. 

The above/and foregoing song, have appeared in print. For 
their faults I am responsible; if they possess any beauties, as 
their author, 1 have a right to claim tliera. 



BRITANNIA CONSOLED. 

Written in the year 1810, 
On the high tow'ring top of the fam'd Calton-hill> 
Britannia of late took her stand ; 



70 



In attitude pensive, she lean'd on her spear. 
With her eyes turn'd to Gaul's hostile land. 

With blushes indignant her cneeks were suffusV.^ 
While her white bosom throbb'd with a sigh, 

I mark'd the big tear ofien fall on her breast, 
As it roil'd from lier bright-beaming eye. 

^' Remember your fathers,'"* Britannia exclaimed, 

'• How oft have the}^ fought on yon fields ? 
How frequent the blood of the vanquished Gauls 

Has empurpled their swords and their shields ? 
Can Cressy — can Agiiicourt e'er be forgot ? 

Where Edward, where Henry once fought ; 
Can the matchless atchievements of MarlbVo' the 
great, 

Be ever expung'd from your thought ? 

«< Rouse, heroes of Albion, and sound the alarm^ 
'Tis heaven coiBmands you to fight^ 



71 

Your laws, your religion, your lives are at stake, 
Draw your swords,' and assert human riglit. 

Shall Britain, the envy of nations around. 
Ever bow at a Corsican's shrine ? 

No — sooner may bolts from the thunder of Jove^ 
To the centre strike both rne and mine." 

A silence ensu'd- — when behold from the clouds^ 

Enrob'd in celestial array, 
A spuit descended from regions of light. 

In a cliariot resplendent as day. 
A radius of glory encircled his brow. 

From his breast hung ^ brilliant star ; 
Britannia with rapture beheld her great son. 

'Twas the Hero of fam'd Frafals-ar. 

o 

«■ Hail ! Genius of Britain, my dear native isle ! 
All hail tQ the land of the brave ! 



72 

Thou see'st now before thee, thy high honoured child, 

Th}^ once fav'rite son of the wave. 
On pinions celestial, I range round thy shores, 

Tho' by gross human eye ne'er descry'd; 
Twasthemandateofheav'n, I a'guardian should prove 

To tlie land for ^^ hose freedom I died. 

'• Behold how thy Navies triumphantly ride. 

They exultingly dash the proud wave ; 
Thy Tars are legitimate sons of the sea. 

They'll spurn at the name of a slave. 
Trust thy own potent arm — on no other depend ; 

Let Britons in concord agree ; 
Then, soon will the slaves of a despot confess. 

That Britons alone can be free" 

•' Th' advice is divine," cried the Genius, with joy; 
** My Nelson immortal shall prove ; 



7S 

fiehold on that hill—see yon trophy of faine^ 
*Twas to honour the son whom I love. 

*^ All hail ! to the shade of my Nelson, the brave ; 
Ail hail I to the fane of his fame ; 

May the sons of Edina for ever be blest. 
Who have strove to eternize his name */' 



* The Author owes the preservation of this Poem to a respect, 
able friend in Annandale, without whose care it must have been lost 
for ever.
