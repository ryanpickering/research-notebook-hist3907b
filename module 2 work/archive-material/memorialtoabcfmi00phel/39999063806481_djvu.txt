Memorial from 

The undersi,!jiied Jiave long been the friends and patrons of 
your Board. The cause of missions among the heathen lies near 
our hearts. In the promotion of this cause, we have rejoiced in 
the general confidence reposed in your Board, and in the extensive 
and ardent zeal with which its efforts have been sustained by the 
prayers and benefactions of the churches. At the same time we 
have some griefs in respect to the course of your body on the sub- 
ject of slavery, which we deem it our duty and our privilege re- 
spectfully to submit to your consideration. 

That American slavery is a system of enormous wickedness, 
and pregnant with immense evils to master and slave, to the na- 
tion, the church, and mankind ; that it is hence the solemn duty 
of American Christians to reprobate both the system and the prac- 
tice in plain terms, decidedly, and in all suitable ways, and to have 
no fellowship with it; and that, consequently, when the churches, 
or their great official organs, give this system either their silent, or 
their implied, or avowed sanction, they wrong humanity, dishonor 
the gospel, paralyze its saving power, and sin against its great 
Head ; — these we hold to be established and solemn, if not self- 
evident truths. 

What the exact position and action of your body in respect to 
this subject has been and now is, we find it somewhat difficult to 
ascertain. It has been said, that some years since, when a certain 
widow at the South left the Board a legacy of a " fourth part of 
certain negro slaves," the Board took no steps as legatee in regard 
to the matter — thus practically declining the legacy. We learn 
also from a published correspondence of one of your secretaries, 
that a few years since, when some of the missionaries among the 
southwestern Indians had entered into contracts respecting cer- 
tain slaves, which were regarded by some of your patrons as a 
sanction of slavery, your Prudential Committee, on a representa- 
tion of the case being made to them, directed said missionaries to 
enter into no more contracts of the kind, and to immediately can- 
cel such of those already made as had not then expired — which 
action has since received your sanction. We farther learn, from 
the action of your body at its last annual meeting, "that the Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions can sustain no relation 
to slavery which implies approbation ; and as a board, can have 
no connection or sympathy with it." With this declaration of 
your body, we have been greatly gratified. In connection with it, 
we would respectfully ask whether the facts stated above were as 
stated; and whether the action of your committee in the case was 
the result, among other reasons, of a wish to avoid all real and 
even seeming sanction of the slave system ? 

The undersigned receive the declaration just quoted as a dis- 
tinct and specific pledge, that the Board do not intend and will not 
knowingly consent to lend, in any way, any sympathy or sanction 
to the practice of slavery. As such, we rejoice in" it, and com- 
mend the Board for it. At the same time we feel constrained to 
call your attention to what is now a well known fact, viz: that 
Ihv. J. S. Wilson, me of your missionaries, is an aclmowled^ed slave- 
holder ; and, if his statement is correct, that you have some other mis- 
sionaries who are also slaveholders. This is not the place to aroue 
this case at length. We cannot forbear, however, a distinct ex- 
pression of our opinion in respect to it. We are willing to believe 
that in commissioning and sustaining Mr. Wilson as a missionary, 
you have not intended to lend your sympathy or sanction to tlie 
slave system; but that you have done so, and are still doing so in 
fact, we are perfectly certain. We know it is said that Mr. Wil- 
son's is a peculiar case — an exception to the general rule. We 
differ entirely. We do not believe that the circumstances of the 
case constitute any justification of the relationship whatever, or 
any valid reason for its continuance. But waiving this, you will 
not deny that the relationship of master and slave in his case is at 
least of doubtful propriety. The simple fact that the Christian 
mmd of the country is so divided in respect to it is proof of its 
doubtfulness. On this ground, then, if on no liigher, we think 
that he should manumit his slaves, or you should cease to employ 
hnn as your missionary. It is, we believe, clearly, a case to which 
the inspn-ed injunctions and maxims, "Let not your good be evil 
spoken of," "Avoid the appearance of evil," "I will eat no meat 
while the world stands, if it cause my brother to offend," and "He 
that doubteth is damned if he eat," apply in their full force. And 
accordingly, we are decided in the opinion that your Prudential 
Committee, under your sanction and direction, ought to represent 
the case to Mr. Wilson, and earnestly entreat him, for the sake of 
eavmg himself and the cause of missions from reproach, or the 
appearance of evil, or the guilt of wounding the hearts of Chris- 
tian brethren, or the condemnation of a doubtful ma^-, to pro- 
ceed at once to the manumission of his slaves. And if he refuse 
or from any circumstances is unable so to do, then we are equally 
clear that, for the same reasons, you should cease to retain him as 
your missionary. Should he be strictly and truly unable to ter- 
minate the relationship in question, (which we do not for a mo- 
ment believe,) then, it is true, the continuance of it would be his 
misfortune not his fault. Nevertheless, for the reasons just stated, 
the relation would still be a disqualification for the missionary 
work. Fault or no fault, such is the doubtfulness of the case, that 
Mr. Wilson cannot retain his slatgs and yet prosecute his labors 
as your missionary in Africa else where without involving 
himself and you, and, through you, the cause of missions, in re- 
proach, 01- the appearance of evil, or the guilt of wounding the 
hearts of Christian brethren, or the condemnation of a doubtfiil 



to the A. B. C. F. Missions : 

matter. In any event, then, the relationship is a disqualification 
for the inissi^*-y work; and, in the most favorable view of it, 
like any othef^alification which is the misfortune and not the 
fault of its subject, ought not to be taken up and made or contin- 
ued as the misfortune of the missionary work itself! 

We therefore respectfully ask whether any such representation 
of the case has been or is intended to be made to Mr. Wilson ; 
and whether, in the event of his continuing his present relation to 
his slaves after a reasonable time for effecting their emancipation, 
the Board will deem it advisable to continue his services as their 
missionary? We would also respectfully inquire whether the 
Board are aware that any other of their missionaries are, as Mr. 
Wilson supposes, slaveholders ; and if so, how many, and who are 
they ? 

The undersigned would add a word in respect to the subject of 
the solicitation and reception of funds from slaveholders. We do 
not ask the Board to turn aside at all from its appropriate and 
constitutional object— the giving of the gospel to the heathen. 
We only ask, first, that it seek that object truly ; that it therefore, 
in the teachings and the lives of its missionaries, give the heathen 
the real gospel— a gospel sound in the faith and blameless in the 
life, and therefore not a slaveholding or a slavery-justifying one. 
We ask, second, that it seek its object by Christian and only 
Christian methods ; and therefore that it do not solicit or know- 
ingly receive the gains of oppression or of any iniquity at home, 
as a means of sending the gospel abroad. 

In wishing you to seek your object by such methods, we do not 
desire or ask you to "pass resolutions or adopt measures against 
the system of slavery, any more than against other specific forms 
of evil existing in the community." We only ask that your posi- 
tion and action should be the same in one case as in the other. 
Let there be, whenever and wherever the prosecution of your 
great ol^ject brings you in contact with slavery, the same practical 
antagonism and condemnation of it which you have maintained 
and manifested in respect to Sabbath breaking, intemperance, In- 
dian oppression, and the like, and we ask no more. Let your jjo- 
sition and principles of action be as clearly defined in respect to 
slavery as in respect to intemperance ; let them be the position 
and the principles of as practical a condemnation and opposition 
of the one as of the other ; let the readiness of your exposure be as 
prompt, and the tone of your rebuke as firm and unambiguous, in 
respect to the one as the other, wherever they come in your way, 
and not only will your general position be all that any friend of 
the enslaved can rightfully desire, but the great difficulty in re- 
spect to the solicitation and reception of funds will have been 
met. You will then stand in the same relation to slaveholders 
that you now do to spirit makers and spirit venders. You will 
not need to inquire into the motives of individual donors or their 
mode of obtaining their funds. This we have always known to 
be impossible, and have therefore never asked. But your charac- 
ter and position once as well defined and as positively opposed to 
this iniquity as to that of intemperance or Sabbath breaking, you 
and your agents may go forward soliciting and receiving funds of 
the whole community indiscriminately, " asking no question for 
conscience' sake," but presuming, in view of your known character 
and position in the case, as well as your general object, "that the 
funds contributed are obtained in a proper manner and given from 
proper motives," and are not the gains of the iniquity you repro- 
bate and condemn— your known general character, position, and 
object, being an advertisement and a pledge beforehand, that you 
do not solicit and will not receive the gains of said iniquity into 
the treasury of the Lord, knowing them to be such : so that, while, 
as your general rule, you receive" whatever is contributed, " asking 
no question for conscience' sake," at the same time, " if any man 
say unto you," or it be otherwise made plain to you, that this is 
the gain of oppression or the price of blood, you will not touch it, 
" for his sake that shewed it and for conscierice' sake." 

We would then respectfidly ask whether it has be;^ or is the 
purpose of the Board to maintain the same practica^fesition and 
condemnation of slavery, wherever it comes in it/way in the 
prosecution of its great object, as of intemperance. Sabbath break- 
ing, Indian oppression, and "other specific forms of evil existing 
in the comimmity ?" Also, whether it has been the practice or is 
the purpose of the Board to decline the solicitation and reception 
of funds known to be the gains of oppression or the price of men ? 

The Board will perceive that the undersigned have been as ex- 
plicit as possible in this communication. It is in no captious spirit, 
nor with any desire to involve the Board in embarrassment that 
we have been so, but the reverse. In former communications 
with the Board, by the friends of the enslaved, we have thought 
that great evil has resulted from the want of such explicitness. 
We have wished to avoid such evil. That we might do it, and 
that there might be no room for misconception or misunderstand- 
ing in respect to the views and position of the Board on this im- 
portant and momentous subject, we have placed the points, on 
vyhich we desire specific information, in the form of distinct ques> 
tions. These, we doubt not, will receive the candid and cai-eful 
consideration of the Board. 

With sincere desire and fervent prayer for the prosperity of our 
common cause and of the Board, we are 

Yours, in the fellowship and faith 

Of the gospel of our common Lord.
