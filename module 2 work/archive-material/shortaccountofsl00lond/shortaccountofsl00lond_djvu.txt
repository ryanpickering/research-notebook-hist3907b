Slave - Trade, 



IT is a Truth, as forrowful as obvious, that 
Mankind too generally are adluated by falfe 
Motives, and fubftitute an iiiaaginary Interefl: 
in the Room of that which is real and per- 
manent: And it mull be acknowledged by every 
Man,' who is fincerely defirous of becoming ac- 
quainted y/ith himfelf, and impartially infpe6ls his 
own Heart, that Weaknefs and inbred Corruptipn. 
attend human Nature; which cannot be reilored 
to its origirnai Purity, but through the Efficacy of 
the Blood of Jisus Christ, our bleiled Saviour, 
So that notwitnilanding the imagined moral Rec- 
titude pleaded for, and the boafted Pretences of 
thcprefent Age, to refined Conceptions of Things 
beyond our Forefathers, till this Divine Help is 
embraced, the Heart of Man will remain corrupt, 
and its Power of diftinguifhing between Good and 
Evil will ftill be obfcured by Prejudice, PaiTion and 
Interefl. Covetoufnefs and Pride have introduced 
many iniquitous Pradices into civil wSociety, which 



T

tho' odious in themfelves, and mod pernicious in 
their Confeqyences, yet being calculated to gratify 
our favorite Faflions, have been adopted thro' Cut 
torn, and enforced fo ilrongly by Example, as to 
become familiar to us ', fo that by Degrees we fi- 
lence the Di6lates of Confcience, and reconcile our- 
felves to fuch Things as would, when firft propqfed 
to our unprejudiced Minds have ftruck us witK 
Amazement and Horror. 

A lamentable and fhocking Inflance of the In= 
fluence which the Love of Gain has upon the 
Minds of thofe who yield to its Allurements, even 
when contrary to the Di(5tates of Reafon, and the 
common Feelings of Humanity, appears in the 
Profecution of the Negroe "Trade^ in which the En- 
gUJh Nation has long been deeply concerned, and 
fome in this Province have lately engaged. An 
Evil of fo deep a Dye, and attended with fi^f h 
dreadful Confequences, that no well-difpofed Per- 
fon (anxious for the Welfare of himfelf*, his Coun- 
try, or Pofterity) who knows the Tyranny, Op* 
predion and Cruelty with which this iniquitous 
Trade is carried on, can be a filent and innocent 
Spe6lator. How many Thoufands of our harm- 
lefs Fellow Creatures have, for a long Courfe of 
Years, fallen a Sacrifice to that felfiili Avarice, 
which gives Life to this complicated Wickednefs. 
The Iniquity of being engaged in a Trade, by 
which fo great a Number of innpcent People are 
yearly deftroyed, in an untimely and rriiferable 
Manner, is greatly aggravated from the Confide- 
ration that we, as a People, have been peculiarly 
favoured with the Light of the Gofpel-, that Re- 
yelation of Divine Love, which the Angels intro- 
duced to thp World, by g Declaration of Peace an 
'^ ■ Earlk 



I 5 1 

Earthy and Good JVill to Men of every Nation^ 

Kindred^ 'Tongue and Peeple. How miferable mud 
be onr Condition, if, for filthy Lucre, we ihould 
continue to a6i: fo contrary to the Nature of this 
Divine Call, the Purpofe of which is to introduce 
an univerfal and affedionate Brotherhood in the 
whole human Species •, by removing from the 
Heart of every Individual, who fubmits to its Ope- 
ration, the Darknefs and Corruption of Nature, 
and transforming the felfiih, wrathful, prond Spi- 
rit, into Meeknefs, Purity and Love: For this 
End the Son of God became Man, fuffered, and 
died ; and the whole Tenor of the Gofpel declares^ 
that for thofe who refufe, or negleft the Offers 
of this great Salvation, the Son of God has fuffered 
in vain. 

The End propofed by this EfTay, is to lay before 
the candid Reader the Depth of Evil attending 
this iniquitous Practice, in the Proiecution of 
which, our Duty to God, the common Father of 
the Family of the whole Earth, and our Duty of 
Love to our Fellow Creatures, is totally difregard- 
ed ; all focial Conne(^ion and tender Ties of Na- 
ture being broken, Defolation and Bloodlhed con- 
tinually fomented in thofe unhappy People's Coun- 
try. It is alfo intended to invalidate the faife Ar= 
guments, which are frequently advanced, for the 
Palliation of this Trade, in Hopes it may be fome 
Inducernent to thofe who are not defiled therewith 
to keep themfelves clear-, and to lay before fiich as 
have unwarily engaged in it, their Danger of totaL 
ly iofing that tender Senfibility to the Sufferings of 
their Fellow Creatures, the Want v/hereof fets 
Men beneath the Brute Creation: A Trade by 
which naany Thoufands of innocent People ar-e

t>fc>iiglit under the greateft Anxiety and Suffering, 
by being violendy rent from their Native Country, 
in the moft cruel Manner, and brought to our Co- 
lonies, to be employed in hard Labour, in 'Cli- 
mates, unfuited to their Nature, or in a State of 
the moft abjed and barbarous Slavery, fubjed td 
the Humours and inhuman Laih of fome of the 
moft hard hearted and inconfiderate of Mankind, 
without any Hopes of ever returning to their Na- 
tive Land, or feeing an End to their Mifery: Nor 
cnuft we omit, in this difmal Account, the Weight 
of Blood which lies on the Promoters of this Trade, 
from the g^eat Numbers that are yearly butchered 
in the Incurftons and Battles which happen be- 
tween the Negroes^ in order to procure the Num- 
ber delivered to the Europeans-, and the many of 
thefe poor Creatures whofe Hearts are broken, anci 
chey perifti through Mifery and Grief, on the Fat- 
fage. May the Almighty preferve the Inhabf^ 
tants of Pennjylvania from being further defiled by 
a Trade, which is entered upon from fuch fenfua.! 
Motives, and carried on by fuch devilifti Means. 

Perfons whofe Minds are engrofled by the Plea- 
fures and Profits of this Life, are generally fo taken 
up with prefent Objedis, that they are but little af= 
fedled with the diftant Sufferings of their Fellow 
Creatures, efpecially when their Wealth is thereby 
increafed. N^vcrthelefs every one who is in any 
refpe6l concerned in this wicked Trafique, if not lo 
hardned by the Love of Wealth, as to be void of 
Feeling, muft upon a ferious RecGllecStion, be im- 
preffed with Surprize and Terror, from a Senfe that 
there is a righteous God, and a State of Retributi- 
on which will laft for ever. It is frequently al- 
^ledged, in excufe for this Trade, that the Negroes 

foM 



[73 

fold in our Plantations, are moftly Perfons who 
liave been taken Prifoners in thofe Wars which arife 
amongft themfelves, from their mutual Animofi-^ 
ties •, and that thefe Prifoners would be facrificed tor 
the Refentment of thofe who have taken them Cap- 
tive, if they were not purchafed and brought away 
by the Europeans, It is alfo reprefented, that the 
Negroes are generally a ftupid, favage People,, 
whofe Situation in their own Country is neceiritou& 
and unhappy, which has induced many to believ^, 
that the bringing them from their Native Land 
k rather a Kindnefs than an Injury. 

To confute thefe falfe Reprefentations, the fol- 
lowing Extradts are propofed to the candid Read- 
er's Confideration •, they are taken from the Wri- 
tings of the principal Officers, not only in the En^ 
glijh^ butintheFr^;/fi'andZ)^^^^Fa6tories, or Settle- 
ments in Guineyy fome of whom have lived many 
Years in thofe Countries^ and have been Eye-witnet 
fes to the Tranfadlions they relate. By which it will 
appear, that the i\%T^^i are generally afenfible hu«*^ 
mane and fociable People, and that their Capacity 
is as good, and as capable of Improvement as that 
of the Whites. That their Country, though un- 
friendly to the Europeans y yet appears peculiarly 
agreeable, and welladapted to the Nature of the 
Blacks^ and fo fruitful as to furnifli its Inhabitants 
plentifully with the Neceflaries of Life, with mucb 
kfs Labour than in our more northern Climates. 

And as to the common Arguments alledged in 
Defence of the Trade. ^'/>. That the Slaves fold 
to the Europeans are Captives taken in War, who 
would be deilroyed by their Conquerors if not thus 
purchafed -, it is v/ithout Foundation : For altho* 
^here were doubtlefi Wars amongft the Negroes- 

before 



[ 8 ] 

before the Europeans began to trade v/Ith them, yet 
certain it is^ that fmce that Time, thofe Calamities 
have prbdigioufly encreafed, which is principally 
owing to the Solicitations of the white People,! 
who have inftigated the poor Africans by every 
Method, even the moft iniquitous and cruel, to 
procure Slaves to load their VefTels, which they 
freely and gladly purchafe without any Regard to 
the Precepts of the Gofpei; the Feelings of Hu- 
manity, or the common Dilates of Reafon and 
Equity. 

This plainly appears from the Account given by 
Andrew Brue, General Dire6lor of the French Fac- 
tory at Senagal^ who ti avelled much on and about the 
twogreatRivers of 6"^;;^^^/, d.nd Gaml?ia. InAJilefs 
Collecftion of Voyages, he is fpoken of as a Perforr 
of Judgment, and one who had had fufficient Op- 
portunities by his long Relidence * there, of gain- 
ing a thorough Knowledge of the Manners, Cul- 
toms and DifpoHtions of the People inhabiting the 
Country, for aDout fotir hundred Miles along thd 
Coail, extending on each Side the before mentio- 
ned Rivers. Speaking of the Papel Negroes -f 
(amongfl whom he was then endeavouring to eredl 
a Fadory) he fays " They are it continual Wars 
*' with their Neighbours, whom they invade as 

*' often as they think it for their Advantage -- 

^'' Tliefe Wars of theirs are never long, 

"generally 

* The '!f ime o£ Brue\ abode In Guinea cannot be aiTertained, as 
he appears to have gone backv/ards and forwards to France feveral 
Times. When he returned the fecond Time,- he ha;d lived eleven 
Years in Africa j and by lome Wiitings he appears to have been at 
Senagal many Years after. Thro' Millake in the former Editioa 
the Time was fixed to twenty-fix Years. 

f Thele Papel Negroes inhabit about the River St. Domingo^ 
the Ifland BiffaOf^ &c. frora whence ;he Buro^saa* h^vs brv>u^h£ 
great Nuriibtr of Slaves. 



[ 9 ] 

generally fpeaking, they are Incurfions or Ex^ 
peditions of five or fix Days. He adds." 



" l^he Europeans are far from dejiring to 
" a^ as Peace- Makers among/i them^ i. e. (the 
^' Negroes J which would be contrary to their 
^^ Interefty Jince the greater the Wars are^ the 
" more SiaveSo 



William Bofman^ Fa6tor for the Dutch, at Belmi^ 
na, where he refided fixteen Years, relates, " That 
" one of the former Commanders hired an Army 
" of the Negroes^ of Jafferia and Cahjleria, for a 
" large Sum of Money, to fight the Negroes of 
" Commany^ which occafioned a Battle, which was 
" more bloody than the Wars of the Negroes ufu- 
'^ ally are : And that another Commander gave, at 
" one Time, Five Hundred Pounds, and at another 
*' Time Eight Hundred Pounds, to two other Negroe 
" Nations, to induce them to take up Arms againfl 
^' their Country People." This is confirmed by 
Barhot, Agent General of the French African Com- 
pany, who fays; *' The Hollanders, 2i People very 
'' zealous for their Commerce at the Coafl, were 
" very ftudious to have the War carried on 
" amongft the Blacks, to diftrad, as long as pof-- 
" fible^ the Trade of the other Europeans -, and to 
*« that EiFe<^ were very ready to aflift upon ail Oc- 

B , " cafion^j 



[ ro 1 

*^ Cafions, tlie Blacks^ their Allies, that they might 
" beat their Enemies, and lb the Commerce fall 
" into their Hands." But nothing fhews more 
plainly, that the Enropeam are the chief Inftru- 
ments in inciting the Negroes to the Perpetration 
of thofe unnatural Wars, by which they are kept 
in continual Alarm.s, their Country laid wafte, and 
fuch great Numbers carried into Captivity, than 
the Account given by William '^ith^ who was fent 
by the African Company to vifit the^ir Settlements^ 
in the Year 1726, from the Information he receiv- 
ed of one of the Fadlors, who had refided ten Years; 
in that Country, viz. " That the difcerning Na- 
'' tives account it their greateft Unhappineisr rhat 
'' they were ever vifited by the Europeans-. — Thft$ 
^"^ we Chriftians introduced the Traffick of Slaves, 
^' and that before our coming they lived in Peace •, 
'' but, iuy they, it is obfervable, that whereve? 
^' Chriilianity comes, there comes with it a Sword, 
« aGun, Powder and Ball." 

This is farther confirmed by two Occurrences 
related by Andrew Brue, the Director at Senegal^ 
before mentioned : The.iiril atP.'?^^ 30. viz. That- 
having acquainted the King he was ready to trade 
with him, if he had a fufficient quantity of Slaves y 
the King procured three Hundred Slaves^ but 
wanting Goods to double the Value of what the 
Company would allow for thofe Slaves^ and they re- 
fufmg to truft him, as he v/as already in their Debt; 
the Diredor propofed having a Licence for feizing 
upon fo many of his People as would pay tor what 
more Goods he wanted, but this the King refufed, 
to confent to, faying it might occafion a Difliir- 
bance amongft his Subjeds-, and fo was forced,. 
fays the Author^ to v/ant the Goods he defired for 

that 



that Time; v/hich Difappcintmenf: pnt the King 
greatly out of Humour. The fecond Occurrence 
is mentioned at Page 150, viz. The Diredlor re- 
ceived Complaints of tht continual Iniuks the 
Company's Servants fuifered at Fort St. JefepI^ 
from one 5^^^/ the King's Alkair, * by forbidding 
-the Trade, in order to oblige the Fadior to pay the 
King as high Duties as thofe paid to the neighbour- 
ing King, or to force the French to quit the Ccun« 
try. Upon this Complaint, the general Diredor 
Brtie^ fent Orders to tne Commander of that Fort, 
to provide the Place with proper NeceiTaries f jr its 
Defence, and then to puniili Bahle rigorouQy, not 
only by burning his Village, but alfo by feizing 
liimfelf. Wives and Children, if he found Oppor- 
tunity. 

Thus the Matter remained for fome TimiC, 
.when the Author fays, the Negroes recommenced 
their lil-ufage to the French^ which went fo far, 
that a Fa6tor was murdered: Upon which, the 
Commander having ailembled all his Forces, at- 
tacked the Village, which he plundered and burnt; 
killed near {\yxj ot the Negroes^ who had taken up 
Arms, wounded double the Number, carried olf 
all the Cattle, and made four Hundred Slaves. 
I'he Author adds, " So fevere and feafonable a 
" Punifhment, threw a Terror on all the Couiitry^ 
:" and obliged the King and his Bakerris to fue for 
'' Mercy." 

The Commander fuftered himfelf to be lone: in- 
treated before he would grant them Peace, and ia 
the mean Time fent down his Slaves and Booty 
by the Barks to Fort St. Louis. Little need be 
faid to fhew the unjuft and barbarous Conduct of 
the French Officers in thefe TranfadionSj ths Truth 

of 
f The Governor of the Village. 



[ 12 ] 

of which cannot be queftioned, as they are taken 
from the Relation given by Brue himlelf. In the 
firft Inflance, the Head ot a Ghriilian Factory en- 
deavours to perluade a Heathen King to break 
thro' every facred and human Tie •, which fhews, 
that fo he could but procure Slaves^ he was quite 
indifferent as to the Means, be they ever Sp crimi- 
nal And in the fecond, this Chrifliian Fador 
himfelf ihiews the greateft Diii'egard to the Right of 
Mankind, and the Feelings of Humanity, on fo 
flight a Pretence as the Demand of Duties, by his 
own Confefnon, no greater than they paid elfe- 
where-, gives to his Officers the moft cruel and un- 
reafonable Orders, which on the Death of a Fadbor 
(which miight be occafioned by his own Rafhnefs 
or Imprudence) are executed with the utmofl Se- 
verity. And vsrhat makes it look likely, that pro- 
curing a Number of Slaves was his chief Motive, 
is, that after this Treatment the Officer gives no 
Ear to I heir Intreaties for Peace, till he has fent off 
the Booty of four Hundred Slaves he had made in 
the Encounter. But fuppofing the Negroe Officer 
to have been to blame, what had the common 
People done to be thus cruelly butchered and 
dragged into Captivity. What an Examgje. was 
this to be given from Ghriilians to Heathens. 
Could any Thing be more likely to confirm the 
Negroes in the deteftable Pradice of enllaving their 
unhappy Countrymen. 

As to the Account of the natural Difpofition of 
jnany of the Negroes^ and of the Fruitful nefs of 
their Country, the forementioned Authors, as well 
as many others, have wrote largely upon it. M. 
Adanfon^ in his Account of the Country and Na- 
tives of Goree^ where he was fo lately as the Year 



I ^3 5 

1 754, after giving an Account of .the delightful 
Alped: of the Country, fays; '^^ The Simplicity of 
" the Natives, their Drefs and Manners, revived 
" in my Mind the Idea of our firfl Parents; and I 
^^ feemed.to contemplate the World in its primitive 
" S tate •,---•' -they (the iV(?^'-ri'^.;) are generally fpeak« 
" ing,' very good natured, fociablc and obliging. 
^^ I was not a little pleaied (fays he) with this my 

,"' firil Reception ♦, it convinced me, that there 

" ought to be a confiderable Abatement made in 
^* the Accounts I had read and heard ever/ where 
" of the favage Charadter of the Africans.——— I ob- 
'' ferved, both in Negroes and Moors^ great Hu- 
" m.anity and Sociablenefs, which gave me flrong 
" Hopes that I fhould be very fafe amongft them, 
" and meet with the Succefs I defired in my En- 
" quiries after the Curiofities of the Country." 

Bofman^ fpeaking of the Negroes of that Part of 
Gumey where he then was, fays ; " They are gene- 
" rally a good Sort of People, honefl in their Deal- 
*' ings; others he defcribes as being generally 
" friendly to Strangers, pf a mild Converfation, 
" courteous, affable, and eafy to be overcome 
" with Reafon; in Converfation they difcover a 
" great Quicknefs of Parts and Underilanding." 
He adds, " That fom.e Negroes^ v/ho have had an 
*^' agreeable Education, have manifefled a Bright- 
^' nefs of Underftanding equal to any of us." . ; 

V/ilUam S7nitFs> Account of th<: Natives is, Tfeat 
" he found them a civil good natured People,, in- 
*' duftrious to the kfi: Degree, and their Country 

f' exceeding feirile. It is eafy (fays he) to 

" perceive what happy Memoirs they are bieffed 
'' with, and how great Progrefs they would make 
*: in the Sciences, in Cafe their Genius was culti- 

^^ vatcd 



{ H ] 

** vated with Study : They explain thetnfelves in 
:" choice Terms, their ExprelTions noble, and 

" Manners polite-, this (he adds) is to be un- 

^' derflood of the People of Diftindlion, as OfEcers, 
:" Merchantmen, and the like-, for Peafants, 
*• Workmen and Shepherds, are as ignorant in 
^* thefc Parts as elfewhere." 

Barbot fays, " The Inhabitants of Oedo are, for 
*' the Generality, very civil, good natu red People, 
^' eafy to be dealt with, condefcending to what the 
•*' jE^/r^j)^^;?^ require of them, in a civil Way-, but 
*-'■ if treated with Haughtinefs and rudely, they 
•" are ftifF and high, and will not yield on any 
« Account." 

A. Brue, fpeaklng of the People of Benin^ fays, 
'^' They are generally good natured and civil, and 
*' maybe brought to any Thing by fair and fofc 
" Means. If you make them Prefents, they will 
'' recompenfe them double. If you want any 
" Thing of them, and aflc it, they feldom deny ir, 
^' even tho' they had Occafion for it themfelves : 
" But to tr?at them harihly, or think to gain any 
*' Thing of them by Force, is todifputc with the 
^•^ Moon." Jrlus^ fpeaking of the fame People, 
fays, " They are a fincere inofFenfive People, and 
" do no Unjuilice either to one another or Strang- 
'' ers. He adds, that it is a capital Crime there to 
" in] are a Foreigner, which is feverely puniihed. 

In the Colicciion of Voyages, we are told, 
^^ That fome Writers have reprefented the Natives 
'' of Cape Mejurade^ as faithlefs and cruel \ but it 
" is very likely this F.eprefentation of their Difpo- 
^' fitions v/as occafioned by the Refentment they 
" had flicwn for the lil-ufage received from the 
-" Etiropeens'^ for Capt. Philips declared them to be 

civil 



[ 15 ] 

" civil and courteous". And Snosh fays, " He 
" found them a civil good natured People-, but 
*' that the late Injury they had received from the 
" Englijh, who had carried off fome of their Fco- 
" pie, * had fo exalperated them, that it was to 
" be feared fome Englifh they had in their Power, 
" would fall a Sacrifice to their Refentment. 

Altho* the extream Heat in many Farts of Gui- 
nea^ is fuch, as is neither agreeable nor healthy to 
the Europeans^ yet it is well fuited to the Conftitu- 

tion 

* It is thefe Abafes which the Africans have fo often. 
fufFeredfropn the ii'arc^^ami that have given Rife to the fre-^ 
quent Contradidlions we meet with in Authors, with refpeft to 
the Temper and Difpofitron of the Negroes y one Author 
fpeaking well of fome Nations, whilft another Author repre- 
fents the fame Nation as barbarous and favage. And, indeed, 
when it is confidered how often the Europeans have moft grie-* 
voufly provoked them, by treacheroufly carrying away fome 
of their Country-men, Friends or Relations. It is not to be 
wondered that fome Negroe Nations Ihould have appear'd fired 
with Anger and Refentment, againft thofe who have done 
them Injuries of fo affefting a Nature. In the Collection of 
Voyages it is faid, " The frequent Injuries done to the ^a 
*' i^a Negroes by the Eitropeansy in carrying fome off, have 
*' made them extremely Ihy and fufpicious. The Ship in 
*' v/hich Capt. Smith went oa the Coaft, ©ftea lay before the 
*' Towri, and fired a Gun for the Blacks to come off, but not 
*• a Soul came near them. At length they were informed the 
** Natives feldom ventured on board an EngUjh Ship, for fear 
" of being carried away. After this Intelligence they fhewed 
*' nothing but French Colours, by which Pvleans the Natives 
** were brought to trade with them. Smith gives thefe iW- 
*' ^roes a bad Charader; but in the Colleftion of Voyages it 
*' is faid that other Authors agree, that altho' they are in Ap- 
** pearance the moft barbarous of all Guinea^ yet are they, in 
** the Main, polite and rational, and fo reputed among 
** their Neighbours.** 

Marchais fays, " They appear rude and favage, but on 
*' dealing with them, you find them a good Sort of People, 
** fiank^ civil, and the fairell Traders on theCoafl,-—

tiohof t\\t Negress: And it is to thofe Heats that 
they are indebted for the FertiHty of their Land, 
which in moft Places is fo great, that with little 
Labour Grain and PVuit will grow in the greateil 
Plenty. 

Andrew Br ue^ fpeakin'g 6f the great River Sena^ 
galy which runs many Hundred Miles within Land, 
fays, " The farther you go frojii tii^Q Sea, the 
" Country on the Pviver feems more fruitftjl, and 
♦' well; improved. It abounds in Indian Corn, 
^' which is a never failing Commodity here — - — 
" The Ifland of Bifejha^ which is formed by an' 
^' Arm of that River, abounds in Indian and Gui- 
<' nea Corn, Rice, Pulfe, Tobacco and Indigo. 
'^^ Wheat thrives well after the fecond Crop. Cot- 
" ton-trees in plenty— -—Here are vafl: Meadows, 
*' which feed large Herds of great and fmall Cat- 

«« tie -Poultry are numerous, as well as wild 

*' Fowl." Yet it fometimes happen that thfere is 
great fcarcity in particular Places,- arifmgfrom the 
improvident Difpofition of fome of the Negroes^ 
#ho have little thought of making any Provifion 
but from one Harveit to another, fo that they are 
liable to fuifer when that fails, or when the Locuft 
devour the Produce , thefe Inle6ts fometimes come 
in fuch Swarms as to darken the Air, and deftroy 
every green Thing that lays in their Way. 

The fame AUhor^ m his Travels to the South of 
the River Gambia^ expreifes his Surprife to fee ^ 
" The Land fo well cultivated, as he obferved it 
^' to be; fcarce a Spot lay unimpro%^ed, the low 
*' Ground divided by fmali Canals, were all fowed 
" with Rice-, the higher Ground planted with,!);- 
" dian Corn and Millet, and Peafe of difFcrent 

" SortSr 



I ^7 3 

" Sorts. Beef and Mutton very cheap, as well as 
" all other Neceffaries of Life. 

Bofman fays, " The Indian and Guinea Corn is 
" here fown and reaped twice every Year; the firil 
" H;irvefl is in Auguft^ and the other the latter 
*' End of the Year, though but fmali; Cora 
" grows with little Trouble, very fpeedily taking 
*' Root. Indian Corn grows in the upper Lands, 
" in prodigious Quantities, and where Corn won't 
^^ grow, there Rice increafes in Abundance, and 
*' Yamms and Potatoes are in the greatefl Plenty.'* 

Speaking of the Kingdom of Fida^ he fays, 
" The Country v/as very populous, many large 
" Villages, befides innumerable fmall Ones, 
^' through the whole Country, plentifully provid- 
'^ ed with Corn, Potatoes and Fruit, which grew 
*' clofe to each other; in fome Places a Foot-path 
*' is the only Ground that is not covered with 
" them, xh<t 'Negroes leaving no Place, which is 
*' thought fertile, uncultivated, even within the 
" Hedges which inclofe their Villages : And the 
*' very next Day after they have reaped they are 
*' fure to fow again." This fine Country is now 
very much depopulated, which, it is likely, 
was owing to the Incurfions made upon thera 
by their Neighbours, in order to get Slaves to 
fell to the Europeans. For the fame Bofmein^ fpeak- 
ing of the neighbouring Nation of Pope^ fays; 
" They depend on Plunder and the Slave-'Tradey 
" in which they exceed fome of their Neigh- 
" bours." 

Other Parts of the Country he defcribes, as 
*' being full of Towns and Villages; the Soil ve-

From what has been faid, it may be concluded 
that the Negroes might have been happy, if the 
Europeans had not bore the Name only, but had, 
indeed, a6led the Part of Chriflians, in ufing their 
Endeavours, by Example as well as Precept, to

** lefs Inclination to ferve him." 

Holhen, who lived eight Years in that Country, and examin- 
ed with the greateft Precaution into all the Culloms, Manners 
and Opinions of the Hottentots, fets thefe People in a quite 
different Light from what they appear in former Authors,

their unhappy Subjecls, and become their Oppref- 
fors; as is tully evidenced by the following Ac- 
count, viz, 

Francis Moore^ Fa6lor to the African Company^ 
in 1730, tells his Readers, ,%'^ That when the King 
*' of Barfalli wants Goods or -Brandy, he fends a 
*' MefTenger to the Engliflj Governor at James^% 
*' Fort, to defire he would fend up a Sloop with a 
*' Cargo of Goods, which, fays the Author^ the 
*' Governor never fails to do: Againft the Time 
*' the VeiTei arrives, the King plunders fome of 
*' his Enemies Towns, felling the People for luch 
*' Goods as he Vv-ants, which commonly is Brandy 
*' or Rum, Gunpowder, Ball, Fire-arms, Piftols 
*' and CutlalTes for his Soldiers, i^c. and Coral 

*' and Silver for his Wives and Miftreifes.- If 

*' he is at War with no neighbouring King, he 
*' falls upon one of his own Towns, and makes 
*' bold to fell his own miferable Subjefts. He of- 
*^ ten goes with fame of his Troops by a Town in 
*' the Day-time, and returns in the Night, and 
*' fets Fire to three Parts of it, placing Guards at 
*-' the Fourth, to feize the People that run out of 
*' the Fire, then ties their Arms behind them, and 
^' marches them to Joar or Rohone^ where he fells 
« them." 

Brue^ the French Fador, fays, " That having 
*' received Goods, he wrote to the King, that if 
*' he had a fufficient Num.ber of Slaves, hev/as 
*' ready to trade with him-, this Prince, fays that 
*' Author, as well as the other Negros Monarchs, 
*' have always afure Way of fuppiying his Dejfici- 
*' encies, by falling their own Subjeds, for which 
" they feldom want Prctenfions of fome Kind or

Kings, thus feeking Pretences to cover their 
Crimes, fhew they are not quite void of Shame, 
nor inlenfible that Covetoufnefs induces them to 
ad a Part fo inconfi'ilent with th^ir Duty, but herer 
they may plead the Example and Solicitation of the 
more knowing Europeans, ''' The King had Re- 
*' courfe to this Method, by feizing three Hun- 
*' dred of his ovm People, and fent Word to Brue^ 
*' that he had the Slaves ready to deliver for the 
^ Goods." The fame Author further adds^ 
" That fome of the Natives are, on all Occafions^ 
" endeavouring to flirprize and carry off their 
" Country People: They land (fays he) without 
"*' Noife, and if iK^y find any lone Cottage, with- 
*' out Defence, they furround it, and carry off all 
*' the People and Effects to tht^ir Boat:—- — The 
^' Slaves are fold to the Europeans, unlefs they be 
*' Perfons of fome Rank, whofe Friends can re- 
" deem them, by paying two Slaves, or five or 
" fix Oxen." 

John Bm-hot fays, " The Slaves fold by the iV>«. 
*' groes are for the moft Part Prifoners ot War, or 
^^ taken in the Incurfions they make into their 
'* Enemies Territories-, others are iiolen away by 
^' their own Countrymen. Abundance of little 
" Blacks, of both Sexes, are (lolen away by their 
" Neighbours, when found abroad, on the Koads, 
" or in the Woods, or elfe in the Corn Fields, at 
" the Time of the Year when their Parents keep 
" them there all Day, to fcare away the devouring 
" fmall Birds." 

Francis Moore, the Engli/h Fa6fcor, fays, " That 
" captivating the People is, by Cuflom, become 
'* {o familiar, that when the King of Kay or wants 
^ to make a Prcfent to the Fador, f(jr what he has

" Slaves taken up at the neareft Village. Unhap-

adds, ^'' That in Battle they fpare the Enemies as

^ of Qiiality, taken Pr.ifontrs, are not exempted:

of the fame Species, and are originally defcendsJ 

from the fame Parents, they have the fame 

rational Powers as we have v they are free moral 
Agents, as we are, and many of them have as 
good natural Genius, as good and as brave a Spirit 
as any of thofe to whom they are m^de Slaves. 
To trade in Blacks^ then, is to trade in Men •, the 
black-fkin'd and the white-fkin'd being all of the 
fame Species, all of the human Race, are by Na- 
ture upon an Equality ; one Man in a State of 
Nature, as v/e arc with Refpedt to the Inhabitants 
of Guiney^ and they with Refped to us,, is not fu- 
perior to another Man, nor has any Authority or 
Dominion over him, or any Right to lay his Com- 
mands upon him : He tliat made us,, made them, 
and all of the lame Clay : We are all the Work. . 
manlliip of his Hands,, and he hath affigned this 
Globe to the human Race, to dwell upon : He 
liath given this Earth, in common, to the Chil- 
dren of Men. God gave to Man Dominion 

over the Fijh of the Sea^ and over the Fowl of the 
Air^ and over the Cattle^ and over all the Earthy and 
ever every creeping Thing that creepeth upon the^ Earthy „ 
G^n, i. 26-, but not to any one Man over another : 
Nor can one Man, on any Suppofition whatever,, 
become the Property, or Part of the Goods or 
Eftatc, of another Man y as his Horfe or his 
Dog is. 

The European Whites, and the African Blacks, 
are all, under the fame Moral Law, the eternal 
•Law of Reafon^ which God hath written' upon 
the Table of Man's Heart. We and they are 
Members of one and the fame great Society,

and ^re joined together, by the clofe and ftrong' 
Ties of human Nature, common to us all ; and 
it is in this Bond of Humanity, that is the Foun- 
dation of all other particular Ties and Connexions 
between Men, and gives Strength to them alK 

^ A Patriot, or a Lover of his Country, is a 

brave Charadcr •, but a Lover of Mankind is a 
braver Charadcr. 

Our being Chriftians docs not give us any 
worldly Superiority, or any Authority whatever, 
■over thofe who are not Chriftians. Christ's 
Kingdom is not of this World , neither does 
Chriftianity dilTolvc or free us from the Obliga- 
tions of Jufticc, Equity, and Benevolence to- 
Avards our Fellow Creatures of the fame Species, 
be they Jews^ Mahometans^ or even black-ilcin'd 
Heathens^ which the Law of Nature lays us un- 
der ; but, on the contrary, greatly ftrengthens 
them. The Jews^ in our Saviour's Time, un- 
derftood that Precept, ^ou jJjalt love thy Neighs 
hour as thyfelf^ in a very confined Senfe, as re- 
lating only to their own Couji^ymen. But this 
Precept, as adopted into the Chriftian Religion, 
takes in all Mankind. By our Neighbour we 
are to underftand every Individual of the humaa 
Species. We are commanded in the Gofpel, 
;to render all their Ducs^ and ~ to do unto others^ as 
we would they JJoould do unto us^ to be kind^ merd^ 
ful and compafftonate^ to he rmdy to co?nmunicate^ 
and to do Good, Which Precept, and many o- 
thers to the fame Purpole, are not to be under- 
■ftood, in luch a nan^ow Senfc, as if they related 
only to thofe who are of the fame Religion with 
ourfeives, or whofe Skin is of the fame Colour 
with ours, as is evident from other Precepts of 

the 



[ 40 ] 

the Gofpcl. We are commanded to do Good t0 
alU efpecially to thofe who are of the Hcu/hold of 
Faith ^ to imitate our Heavenly Father^ who doeth 
Good to ally and whofe tender Mercies are over all 

his PForks^ yea, and to love our Enemies. Thefe 

Propofitions I believe no body would have rcfufed 
to grant ; but though they are fo evident that few 
will exprefly deny, or difpute the Truth of them, 
yet, it is reafonable to fuppofe, that thofe who 
are concerned in the Man-Trade, do not allow 
themfelves to think on thefe Truths impartially, 
ferioufly to confider them, and lay them to Heart ; 
but that on the contrary, they have, fome how 
©r other, a Kind of confufed Imagination, or 
half formed Thought, in their Minds, that the 
Blacks are hardly of the fame Species with the 
white Men, but are Creatures of a Kind fome- 
v/hat inferior : I fay it is reafonable to fuppofe fo -, 
for I do not know how to think that any white 
Men could find in their Hearts, that the commoa 
Sentiments of Humanity would permit them to 
treat the black |vlen in that cruel, barbarous 
Manner in which they do treat them, did they 
think and confider that thefe have rational im- 
mortal Souls, that they are made after the Image 
of God, as well as themfelves, and that, being 
in the fame Body, they have the fame PafTions, 
Senfes and Feelings, as they have, and are as fuf- 
ceptible of Pain and Grief, and upon the fame 
Occafions, as they. — — Man-ftealing is not only 

unlawful 1 think it the mofh atrocious, de- 

teilate Crime. To ileal a Horfe, or to rob a 
Man on the Road of his Money, is reckoned, 
among us, a capital Crime, deferving Death, and 
isj by Law, puniiliaWe with Death. What then

their Will, to trade in Merj^ as you would iiu 
brute Creatures, or any otht' Commodities,^ is 

F ic~ 



[ 42 ] 

really impious as well as cruel. Man is a noble 
Creature, made but a little lower than the An- . 
gels, and crowned with Glory and Honour. He 
is the Offspring of God ; therefore thus to de- 
bafe him, and to bring him down upon a Level 
with the Brutes, yea with Things inanimate, is 
great Impiety, it is an high Affront offered to 
him, who is the kind and merciful Father of us 
all, who hath made of one Blood all Nations of 
Men to dwell on the Face ot the Earth, and 
hath united them all in one Body by the Ties of 
Nature. It is iikewife an Affront put upon Man- 
kind, upon the whole human Race, which fhouki 
raife a generous Refentment and Indignation in 
the Breafl of every one that partakes of the hum.an 
Nature, and has any Notion of the Dignity of 
it, or any Senfe of Humanity, which he ihould 
exprefs and difcover upon all proper Occafions, 
and in all proper Ways.— And I think the Re- 
ceiver, in this Cafe, will appear to be worie, to 
be more guilty, in fome Refpeds, than the bare 
Thief, if we fairly confider the Matter. 

It is evident, that the Europeans^ in fending 
Ships yearly to the Coaft of Africa^ to buy Slaves, 
v/ithout enquiring how thofe they purchaie them 
of came by them, do encourage thofe Thieves, 
and tempt them to make a Practice and Trade of 
Healing their own Countrymen •, foi this is the 
fame Thing in Elfedl:, as if they were to tell them 
in fo many Words. '-^ Ton get Men ready for uSy 
" hozv you can^ and we will take them off year 
" Hands" Befides, thofe Men-merchants not 
only encourage others in this cruel flagitious Prac- 
tice of Man-ifealing, but are really guilty oi it 
thcmfelvts. You will obferve, that v/hat is done 

by. 



[ 43 ] 

by tlieir Command, and according to their Or- 
ders, I confider as done by themfelves. As thofc 
poor miferable Creatures were llolen, thofe who 
did ileal then^, c^ould not convey any Right ia 
them to others, though thefe others Ihould give 
ever fo much in Purchafe of them, any more than 
if they had tliem for nothing. For thofe Purch^f- 
ers then to deprive them of their Liberty, and, by 
Force, keep them in their Poflefiion, in whom they 
have no Right (fiippofing one Man could be the 
Property of another) and who never injured them 
in the lead, nor forfeited their Liberty; to keep 
them in Bonds, and carry them away Captives, is 
properly fpeaking, Man-ftealing. And what ag- 
gravates this Crime in the European Man-mer- 
chants, and renders it much more heinous in them 
than rn the Africans^ is, that the former enjoy th@ 
Light of the Gofpel, and profefs themfelves to be 
Chriflians. 

Man-ilealing is a Kind, and indeed the worfl 
Kind, of Sacrilege, which Confideration farther 
fliews the Impiety of it. Man is facred, and is> 
by Nature, devoted to the Service of God, to 
whofc Authority alone he is obliged to yield .an ab^ 
folate, unlimited Obedience; for one Man there- 
fore to aiTault another, and, by meer Force, to 
make a Captive of him, not for any Crime that h@ 
has been guilty of, but to make a Penny of him, 
confidering him as Part of his FoiTeffions or Goods, 
with which he can do v/hat he pleafes, is robbing 
of God, which is Sacrilege. 

It is very common in the Countries, where the 
Europeans carry on this Trade, for the petty Kings 
and Princes, of which there are a great many, to 
go to War with their Neighbours, not in Drfence 

of 



1 -44 ] 

'-bttheir Right, not to get Satisfa6lion for any In- 
'juries done them, or to repair any Damages they 
'liave unjilftly fu'ffered by thofe Neighbours, but 
^•purely to get Fri Toners againft the Time the Ships 
■from Europe arrive upon their Coaft, that. with 
■lihem they may be able to purchafe of the Captains 
"6f thofe Ships the Goods they have on board. 

Now here the Injury and Crime is the fame in 
^Kind as in the former Cafe, and -indeed greater in 
tht Kind : In both Cafes it is ftealing Man, but in 
-the latter it is attended v^ith fliedding -of Blood, 
nvith Slaughter and Defl:ru6lion •, which Confidera- 
tion doth aggravate the Crime of our Guiney Mer- 
chants, who purchafe thofe Prifoners. Christ 
' ^lath faid, that Mejfed ere the Peace-makers^ fcr they 
fijallie called the Children of God. But how con- 
trary to what our Saviour re<:om.mends, the mak- 
ing of Peace among Men, is the Spirit and Fradice 
of thofe, who, for Lucre Sake, provoke and en- 
courage others ;to go to War with their Neigh- 
bours, and by unjuft Force to kill and deilroy 
feme, and others of them to make Prifoners. 

But let iis nov/ fuppofe, that the Prifoners, 

which are bought, v/ere even engaged in an un- 
juft War, that they Vs^ere the firfl Invaders or A g- 

grelfors -When one King or Prince goes to 

iWar with another, the common Men are not ca- 
pafck of judging of the Merits of the Caufe, which 
Party ^las or has not Right of their Side; but, 
laying afide this Confederation, they are forced to 
go whitkerfoever their King or Captain leads them; 
they are ebhged to obey his Commands, and to 
defem would be Death.tO'them: Therefore I think 
it'w.ould be unjuft and cruel, in him who comes off 
Conqui^rorj though he had Right of his Side, and 

was 



{ 45 ] 

was engaged in a jail War, to deprive thofe com- 
mon Men, who are taken Prifoners, of their Li- 
berty, after the War is over, or at any Time to 
fell them for Slaves for Life, either by Way of 
Punifnment or Retribution, unlefs they be fuppof- 
^edto be anfwerablc for whatever Damage or Inju- 
ry is done by their King, or that they are his 
Goods or Property, both which are abfurd, and 
the latter a Suppofition ilnv/orthy of human Na- 
ture, and fhoclving to the human Mind-, confe- 
quently, the buying of them forfuch, muft be al- 
together as criminal in the Europeans. 

It is reckoned we have now in this Kingdom 
Thirty Thoufand French Prifoners, or more; and 
we fay, that in the War we are carrying on againft 
France^ we have Right on our Side-, that we 
entered into it for the Recovery and Defence of 
■our Territories, invaded by them; but though 
it be' true (as I believe it is) that our Caufe is 
good, yet would it not be cruel and inhuman in 
us, to fell thefe Prifoners into Slavery for Life, and 
in any other Nation, as the Spaniards^ for Inftance, 
to buy them of us, in order to fend them to work 
In their Mines in Peru^ as long asthey live? And 
would not all the other Nations of> Europe exclaim 
againfl us, and the Spaniards^ as inhuman, bar- 
barous People, for fo doing? If it be replied, that 
fuch a Thing would be contrary to Cuilom, and 
to the Law of Nations in Europe^ whereas in Gid- 
ney and Negroeland it is a common Cuilom, to fell, 
for' Slaves the Prifoners they take in War; there 

they make a Trade of it. I own that may be 

one Reafon, among others, why fuch a Thing 
pradifcd in thofe Countries is not looked upon, by 
ws hcrCj with fomuch AbliQrreace andDcteilation, 

as 



T 46 ] 

;as it would be if it were to be pra61:ifed in Europe: 
But this makes no Difference, as to the Nature of 
the Thing in itfelf-, for as I have fhevvn before, 
t\\t Man-trade in this lafl mentioned Cafe, wherein 
the Men who are fold, are fuppofed to be Trifo- 
ners, that were engaged in an iinjufl War, is in

The Captain of the Guiney Ship, v/hen he has 
finiilied his Marketing, when he has bought as 
many reafonable Creatures as he v/ants, and is full 
freighted, having on board (we will fay) Two 
Hundred of them, coupled in Irons, and clofely 
-crammed up in a Ship of about One Hundred 
Tons Burthen, he fets out for one of our Plantati- 
ons, and may be two or three Months on the 

Voyage, during which Time, from the Fileh and 
Stench that mull be among them, occafioned by 
their being put down under Deck, and penn'd to-

among them, and carry off a great many, a Fifth,

chargeable with taking away the Lives of as many 
of thofe poor Creatures, as come by iheir Death 
by being fo conlined and treated, and are guilty 
of Murder-, for to take away a Man's Life, un- 
juilly, is Murder; v/hether it be done in two or 
three Minutes, or two or three Months, that 

makes no Difference. 1 do not think it ne- 

cefTary, in order to convicl a Man of Murder, to 
make it appear that he had an Intention to commit 
Murder: vVhoever does, by unjuil Force and Vi- 
olence, deprive another of his Liberty, and, while 
he has him in his Power, reduces him to fuch a 
Condition, and gives him fuch Treatment, as evi- 
dently endangers his Life, and, in the Event, do

may be reckoned, that of all tliofe who are pur-

Twelve Hioufand die upon the Voyage, and in-

^^ ling us, that the Blacks^ being fo perverfe, ful-

fullen •, would not white Men be fo, were they in 
their Condition, and treated as they are? No 
Doubt but they, would. But the Blacks, though 
they be unjuiliy deprived of their Liberty, banifh- 
ed from their native Country, from all their

Slaves for. Life, though they are treated worfe than

they ought to be pleafant, good humoured, and 
obliging to them that do thus treat them; and, if 
they be not, they lliould be put to Pain and Tor- 
ment. * And they are, it feems, a mifchievous 
Generation, apt to m.utiny and rebel; that is, in

* The Iniquity of the Slave-Trade is greatly aggravated by 
the Inhumanity with which the Negroes are treated in the 
Plantations, as well with refpeft to Food and Cioathing, as 
from the unreafbnable Labour which is commonly exa£ted from 
them. To which may be added the cruel Chaftifements they 
frequently fulFcr, without any other Bounds than the Will and 
Wrath of their hard TafK-Mafters. In Barbadoes^ and fome 
other of the f flands, fix Pints of Indian Corn and three Her- 
rings, are reckoned a full Weeks Allowance for a working 
Slave, and in the Syfterri of Geography, it is faid, '' That in

Truth, they want to recover their Liberty, and^ 
would attempt to do it, if they were not kept in 
Awe by hard Ufage, and fevere Difcipline. In 
the Account of Jamaica, we are told that the Ne- 
groes , when firft brought hither from Guinea^ are 
very fimple, innocent Creatures, but foon turn 
roguifh, and when they come to be whipp'd, urge 

the . 

from two o'clock till dulk: (during which ,Time they are 
attended by Overfeers, who feverely fcourge thofe who ap- 
pear to them dilatory) And before they are fufFered to go to 
their Quarters, they have ftill fomething to do, as collefting 
of Herbage for the Horfes, gathering Feel for the Boilers, ^c» 
fo that it is often half paft Twelve before they can get Home, 
when, they have fcarce Time to grind and boil their Indian 
Corn ; whereby it often happens that they are called again to 
Labour before they can fatisfy their Hunger : And here no 
Belay or Exeufe will avail, for if they are not in the Field 
immediately upon the ufual Notice, they mufl expeft to feel 
the Overfeers Lalli. In Crop-time (which lafls many Months) 
they are obliged (by Turns) to work mofl of the Night, 
in the boiling Houfe. Thus their Owners, from a Defire 
of making the greatell Gain by the Labour of their Slaves, lay 
heavy Burdens upon them, and yet feed and clothe them very 
fparingly, and fome fcarce feed or clothe them at all, fo that the 
poor Creatures are obliged to Ihift for their Living in the befl 
Manner they can, which cccaiions their being often killed in 
the neighbouring Lands, Healing Potatoes, or other Food to 
fatisfy their Hunger. And if they take any Thing from the 
Plantation they belong to, tho' under fuch preffing Want, yet 
their Owners will correct them feverely, for taking a little of 
what they have fo hardly laboured for, whilft they themfelves 

riot in the greatell Luxury and excefs. 'It is a Matter of 

Alloniflimenthow a People who, as a Nation, are looked up-

Whereas, in that of Barbados^ the fame Author 
fays ; " That the Mailers of the Negroes are

are in.— -But how come they to be three times 

the Number of the Whites in this IQand ? Is it not 
owing to the white Inhabitants, to their purchaf-

weak then is this Excufe ? Where is the Senfe of 
afiigning this Majority, which is of their own

on as a gaining Purchafe : And in moft of the other Plantati- 
ons, if the Negroes live eight or nine Years, their Labour is 
reckoned a fufficient Compeniation for their Coil.— —If 
Calculations of this Sort were made upon the Strength and 
Labour of Beafts of Burden it would not appear fo ftrange, 
but even then, a merciful Man would certainly ufe his Beaft 
with more Mercy than is ufually fhewn to the poor Ne- 
groes. Will not the Groans, the dying Groans of 

this deeply afflifted and oppreffed People reach Heaven, and 
when the Cup of Iniquity is full, mull not the inevitable Con- 
fequence be pouring forth of the Judgments of God upon 
their OpprefTors. But, Alas! is it not too manifell that this 
Oppreffion has already lon^ been the Objed of the divine 
Difpleafure ; for what heavier Judgment, what greater Cala-

hardnefs of Heart, that Forgetfulnefs of God, And Infenfibi-

with fiich Severity ?- We have alfo an Account 

from that Author, of thofe Plots laid by the Blacks 
in Antigua^ but which were difcovered by the 
Whites, before they could be brought to bear, 
and of the horrid Executions, which followed upon 
the Difcbvery. " The King, that Is, he who was

of mofl of the Slaves in our Colonies, have at- 
tempted to break out of Prifon, but, being difco- 
vered in Time, failed in their Attempt. Now 
fhould not we have been reckoned, by all the 
World, a cruel barbarous People, if the Govern- 
ment had ordered fome of them to be broke on the 
Wheel, fomx to be burnt alive, and others to be 
flarved to Death, though the French are our Ene- 
mies, and are engaged in an unjuflWar againfl 
us ; whereas thofe Slaves had never done any Hurt 

or Injury to thofe who torture them to Death. 

We 



[ 59 ] ^ 

We reckon ourfelves to be a brave, generous, hu- 
mane civilized People-, but is this a true 

Charader, while that barbarous, favage Man- 
Trade, in the carrying on of which fo many Thou- 
fand Lives are facrificed every Year, is not only- 
winked at, but countenanced and incouraged 

amongft us. There are other Nations in 

Europe^ befides ours, concerned in this Trade, but 
that does not lelTen the Guilt in our People, tho* 
it may keep them in Countenance ^ but the Englijh 
are now more concerned, I believe, than ail the 
other Nations iii Europe taken together, in this 
abominable Trade, which is the greateft Scandal 
and Reproach that lies upon this Natbn-, the re- 
moving of which, by proclaiming Liberty to thofe 
Captives now in our Plantations, making them 
Freemen, and prohibiting for ever, upon the 
fevereft Penalties, the Man-Trade throughout all 
His Majefly's Dominions, and thereby leading the 
Way, and giving a good Example to the other Na» 
tions in Europe concerned in the Man-Trade, 
would be much to the Honour of our Government, 
and I am fure would give great Pleafure to all who 
are Lovers of Mankind, and have a Regard for 
the Honour, Safety, and Profperity of their Coun- 
try.— .—-It is objeded, that if the Englijh^ ^rt to 
drop this Trade entirely, it would be immediately 
thereupon carried on by other Nations^ to a much 
greater Degree than it now^ is.— — -Perhaps that 
might be the Confequence, and it it fhoidd, they 
muft be anfwerable for that, the Guilt and Scandal 
would lie upon them. But if it were certain chat 
this would be the Cafe, this Confideration cannot 
be a juft Reafon for our continuing to carry on fuch 

a 



[ 6o ] 

a wicked Trade. If we Ihould not carry on this 
Trade others would, therefore we may, would be 
a ftrange Way of reafoning. 

And as this Slave-Trade has been encouraged 
by the Government^ for many Reigns back, it is 
queried, whether the prelent Government, in cafe 
they were to fet thofe Negroes in our Colonies at 
Liberty, fliouldnot make good that Lois to their 
Mailers ; but I fhall not take upon me to determine 
that Point; our Governors are belt Judges of that, 
only I think they had better do fo, though it Ihould 
require fome Millions to do it, than fuffer thofe 
poor Creatures to continue in the miferable State 
of Slavery they are now in. There is one Confe- 
quence more, which fpme People fear, would fol- 
low upon prohibiting of the Negroe Trade,- and 
that is, that fuch a Prohibition would greatly lefTen, 
if not utterly ruin, fome other confiderable 
Branches of our Commerce, efpecially the Sugar 
and the Tobacco Trades, becaufe of the Difficulty 
of getting Hands enough, in the Room of the 
Blacks^ to work and labour in thofe Plantations, 
where thcfe Commodities are produced •, but this 
can be no real Objedion againft what I have alTert- 
ed, or in Juftification of the Man-Trade; for if 
this Trade be in itfelf one continued Scene of fuch 
Cruelty and Barbarity, as it hath been reprefented 
to be, it mull be allowed, that it ought to be 
llridly prohibited, let the Confequences of fuch a 
Prohibitation be what they will, that none fhould 
be fuffered to go on, tormenting and murdering 
their Fellow-creatures, Year after Year, though 
we were never any more to fee an Ounce of To- 
bacco or Sugar in Great-Britain, The Inconveni- 
ences, or worldly Difad vantages, arifmg from ad- 

hering 



[ ^I ] 

hering to onr Duty, and adting according to the 
moral Obligations we are under, let them be ever 
fo great, are of no Confideration at all in the Eye 
of Reafon, nor can they have any Weight with, 
or Influence upon an honeft, virtuous Mind, when 
fet againft thefe Obligations. 

The Author of the Dialogues on the Man-Trade, 
concludes with the following Addrefs to the Guinea 
Merchants- in England. 

Sirs, 

AS the Bufmefs you are concerned in, and 
carry on openly and publickly before the 
World, has a bad Afpedt, and you are fenlible 
that moil Men make Objedlions againft it, and 
blame you for engaging in it, you are obliged 
to juftify it to the World, upon the Principles of 
Reafon, Equity and Humanity, to make it ap- 
pear, that it is no unjuft Invadon oi the Perfons, 
or Incroachment on the Rights of < Men; or for 
ever to lay it afide. And this is what every one, 
not only of your Fellow Subjedls in England^ but 
of your Fellow Men upon the Face of the Earth, 
who are any Way concerned in the fame Bufinefs, 
have a Right to infift upon, and demand from 
you V and ought, in a proper Manner to refent it, 
if you will do neither the one nor the other. 

But, laying afide the Refentment of Man, 
which is but of little or no Moment, in Com- 
parifon with that of the Almighty, of the 
Supreme Law-giver and Judge of Mankind, think 
of a future Reckoning. Confider how you fhall 
come off in the great and awtul Day of Account. 
You now heap up Riches, and live in Pleafure? 

but 



[ 62 3 

but oh! what will you do in- the End thereof? 
and that is not far off. What if Death fhould 
feiz-e upon you, and hurry you out of this World, 
under all that Load of Blood-guiltinefs, that now 
lies upon your Souls. The Gofpel (I fuppofe I 
am now fpeaking to profefTed Chriftians) exprelly 
declares, that Sieves and Murderers jhall not in- 
herit the Kingdom of God. Confider that at the 
iame Time, and by the lame Means you now 
treafure up worldly Riches, you are treasuring 
up to yourfelves Wrath^ againft the Day of JVrathy 
and Vengeance that fh all come upon the Workers of 
Iniquity y unlefs prevented, by a timely Repentance^ 
And w^hat greater Iniquity, what Crime that is 
more henious, that carries in it more complicated 
Guilt, can you name, than that in the habitual de- 
liberate Practice of which you now live? Good: 
God! How can you, as fome of you do, go to the 
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper? How can you 
lift up your guilty Eyes to Heaven ? How can you 
pray for Mercy to him that made you, or hope for 
any Favour from him that formed you, while you 
go on thus grofly and openly to difhonour him, 
in debafing and deftroying the nobleft Workman- 
fliip of his Hands, in this lower World ? He is 
the Father of Men; and do you think he will not 
refent fuch Treatment of his Offspring, whom he 
hath fo loved^ as to give his only begotten Son^ that 
whofoever helieveth in him^ might not perifh^ hut have 
everkfiing Life? This Love of God to Man, re- 
vealed in the Gofpel, is a great Aggravation of 
your Guilt; {or if God fo loved us^ we ought alfo to 
love one another. You remember the Fate of the 
Servant, who took Hold of his Fellow-Servant, 
who was in his Debt, by the Throat, and caff 

him 



E 63 ] 

Iiim into Prifon: Think then, and tremble to 
think, what will be your Fate, who take your 
Fellow-Servants by the Throat, that owe you not 
a Penny ^ and make them Frifoners for Life. 

Give yourfelves Leave to iefie(5t impartially up= 
on, and confider the Nature of, this Man-Trade, 
which, if you do, your Hearts mufl needs relent, 
if you have not loft all Senfe of Humanity, all Pi- 
ty and Compaflion towards thofe of your own Kind, 
to think what Calamities, what Havock and De- 
ftru6tion among them, you have been the Authors 
of, for filthy Lucre's Sake. 

God grant you may be made fenfible of your 
Guilt, and repent in Time. And as this is my 
hearty and earneft Prayer to God for you, I hope 
you will excufe the Plain nefs and Freedom of this 
Addrefs in your fmcere Friend, who would be 
glad to do .you any Good that lies in his Power; 

J:P H I L MO R E, 



AN D now Reader, if from the Example of 
others, and without a fufficient Knowledge 
' of the deplorable Confequences attendant 
on this Trade, thou haft inadvertently engaged 
therein, let me befeech thee, by the Mercies of 
Christ Jisus our Lord (thofe Mercies which, 
perhaps, e'er long, thou and I ftiall defire to fly 
to as our only Refuge) that thou wouldft refrain a 
Pradlice fo inconfiftent with thy Duty, both as a 
Chriftian and a Man. Remember, the firft and 
chief Commandment is, nou jhalt love, the Lord 
thy God with all thy Heart. And that the Second 
like unto it is, "Thou jhalt love thy Neighbour as thy^ 



[ H ] 

felf. That our blefTed Redeemer has enjoined lis 
to do unto others as we would they Jhould do unto us-, 
and that it will be thofe who have been righteous 
and merdful to their Fellow-Creatures, that will be 
in titled to the Mercy of the Great Judge of Hea- 
ven and Earth, before whom w^e muft all appear, 
to give an Account of the Deeds done in the 
Body, ^ 

And as for thofe who confefs themfelves now, 
convinced of the Iniquity, and Injuftice of buying 
and felling their Fellow-Creatures, and yet conti- 
nue to keep thofe Negroes they are pofTeffed of in 
Bondage, for the Sake of the Profit arifmg from 
their Labour, it behoves them ferioufly to confider 
their Motives for fuch a Condud; whether the 
Diftin6lion they make between buying a Negroe^ 
and keeping the fame Negroe^ or his Offspring, in 
perpetual Bondage, is not a Plea founded more in 
Words than fupported by Truth ^ for it muft be 
obvious to every Perfon, who is not blinded by 
the Defire of Gain, that the Right by which thcfe 
Men hold the Negroes in Bondage, is no other than 
what is derived from thofe who ftole them, who 
having no other Title, but that which Robbers 
have over their Prey, could not convey any better 
to the Purchafer; and that therefore to continue 
to hold them in Bondage, for worldly Advantage, 
by no other Right than that which thofe guilty 
Men give them, is confenting to, and partaking 
of their Guilt. Inftances may fall out, where 
Men of Candour may be concerned in the Purchafe 
of Negroes^ purely from a Principle of Charity; 
and there are alfo many of the Blacks^^ amongft us, 
whofe Difpofitions, Infirmities or Age, makes it 
ncceffary they iliould be under Care j but in the 

Cafe 



[ 65 1 

Cafe beforemcntionedj where Pcrfons declare 
themfelves convinced of the Injuftice and Iniquity 
of this Trade, and are poiTeiTed of Negroes who 
are capable of managing for themfelves, and have 
fufficiently paid, by their Labour, for their Pur* 
chafe or bringing up, befides the Profit fome Fa- 
milies have reaped, during a long Courfe of Years, 
from the Labour of their Progenitors ; it is the 
undoubted Duty of their PoflelTors to reftore them 
their Liberty; and alfo to ufe all reafonable Endea- 
vours, to enable them to procure a comfortable 
Living, not only as an Ad of Juftice to the In- 
dividuals, but as a Debt due, on Account of the 
Oppreflion and Injuftice perpetrated on them, or 
their Anceftors ; and as the beft Means to avert 
the Judgments of God, which it is to be feared 
will fall on Families and Countries, in Proportion 
as they have, more or lefs, defiled themfelves with 
this iniquitous Trafiick. 

DOUBTS may arife in theMinds of fome, whe- 
ther the foregoing Accounts, . relating to the 
natural Capacity and good Difpofition of many of 
the Inhabitants of Guinea^ and of the violent Man- 
ner in which they appear to be torn from their na- 
tive Land, is fufficiently founded on Truth, as the 
Negroes who are brought to us are feldom heard to 
complain, and do not manifeft that Docility and 
Quicknefs of Parts which might be expelled from 
this Account; Pcrions who may make fuch Ob- 
jedions, are defired impartially to confider whether 
this is not owing to the many Difcouragements 
thefe poor Africans labour under, thougii in an 
enlightened Chriftian Country, and the little Op- 
portunity they have of exerting and improving 
their natural Talents. They are conilantiy em- 

I ployed 



[ 66 3 

ployed in fervile Labour, and the abjc6l Condition 
in which we fee them, from our Childhood, has a 
natural Tendency to create in us an Idea of a 
Superiority and induces many to look upon 
them as an ignorant and contemptible Part of 
Mankind-, add to this, that they have but little 
Opportunity of freely converfing with fuch of the 
Whites as might impart Inflrudion to them, the 
endeavouring of which would, indeed, by moil, 
be accounted Folly, if not Prefumption. A 
Fondnefs for Wealth, or for gaining Efteem and 
Honour, is what prompts mofl Men to the Defirc 
of excelling others, but thefe Motives for the Ex- 
ertion and Improvement of their Faculties caa 
have but little or no Influence upon the Minds of 
the Negroes^ few of them having Hopes of attain- 
ing to any Condition beyond that of Slavery;, fo 
that tho' the natural Capacity of many of them fcje 
ever fo good, yet they have no Inducement or Op- 
portunity of exerting it to any Advantage, which 
rraturally tends to deprefs their Minds, and fink 
their Spirits into Habits of Idlenefs and Sloth, 
which they would, in all Likelihood, have been 
free from, had they flood upon an equal Footing 
with the white People : Neverthelcfs it may, with 
Truth, be faid, that amongfl thofe who have ob- 
tained their Freedom, as well as thofe who remain 
in Servitude, fome have manifefled as much Saga- 
city and Uprightnefs of Fleart as could have been 
expe6Led from the Whites, , under the likeCircum- 
flances; and if all the free Negroes have not done 
the fame, is it a Matter of Surprize? Have we not 
Reafon to make Complaint with Reipecl to many 
of our white Servants, when from under our Care, 
tho' moil of them have had much greater Advan- 
tages 



[ 67 3 

tages than the Blacks ; who, even when free, ftiil 
labour under the Difficulties before-mentioned, 
having but little Accefs to, and Intercourfe with, 
the white People; they yet remained confined 
within the former Limits of Converfation with 
thofe of their own Colour, and confequently have 
but little more Opportunity of Knowledge and 
Improvement than when in Slavery. 

And if* they feldom complain of the unjuft and 
cruel Ufage they have received, in being forced 
from their native Country, &"€. it is not to be won- 
dered at; as it is a confiderable Time after their 
Arrival amongfl: us before they can fpeak our Lan- 
guage, and, by the Time they are able to ex- 
prefs themfelves, they cannot but obferve, from 
the Behaviour of the Whites, that little or no No- 
tice would be taken of their Complaints ; yet let 
any Ferfon enquire of thofe who had attained the 
Age of Reafon, before they were brought from 
their native Land, and he fhall hear fuch Relations 
as, if not loft to the common Feelings of Huma- 
nity, will fenfibly affed his Heart, The Cafe of 
a poor Negrojy not long fmce brought imm'Guine^j^y 
is a recent Inftance of this Kind. From his firft 
Arrival he appeared thoughtful and dejedied, the 
Caufe of which was not known till he was able to 
fpeak Englijh^ when the Account he gave of him-- 
fclf was, that he had a Y\^ife and Children in his 
own Country, that fome of them being fick and 
thinly, he went, in the Night- tim-e, to fetch 
Water at a Spring, where he was violently feized, 
and carried away by fome Perfons who lay in Wait 
to catch Men, whence he was tranfported to Ame-o 
rica-, the Remembrance of his Family, Friends, 
and other Con nedions left behind, which he never 

expcded 



E 68 ] 

expected to fee any more, were the principal Caufcs 
of his Dejedion and Grief. Can any compafTionatc 
Heart hear this Relation without being affeded 
with Sympathy and Sorrow? And doubtlefs the 
Cafe of many of thefe unhappy People would, 
upon Enquiry, appear attended with Circum- 
ftances equally tragical and aggravating. Now, 
you that have fludied the Book of Confcience, and 
thofe that are learned in the Law, what will you 
fay to this deplorable Cafe ? When, and how, has 
this Man forfeited his Liberty ? Does not Juftice 
loudly call for its being reflored to him ? Has he 
not the fame Right to demand it as any ot us 
fhould have, if we had been violently fnatched by 
Pyrates from our native^ Land ? Where Inftances 
of this Kind frequently occur, and are neither en- 
quired into, nor redreflcd by thofe whofe Duty it 
is to feek Judgment^ and relieve the Opprejfed^ what 
can be expedted, but that the Groans and Cries of 
thefe Sufferers will reach Heaven ^ and what Jhall, 
ye do when God . rijeth tip^ and when he viftteth^ 
what /ball ye anfwer him? Did not he that made them 
make uSy and did not one fajhion us in the Womb? *

Inflance of the Calamities and Bloodfhed which the Slave- 
Trade occafions in that Country; and this principally carried 
on at the Infligation of the Black Traders, who from their 
Interccurfe and Converfe with the European Faftors have

every confiderate Reader an earned Defire to

the Objedion with many is, what fhall be done 
with thofe Negroes already imported and born in 
our Families? Mufl they be fent to Africa? That 
would be to expofe them in a ftrange Land, to 
greater DifEcukies than many of them labour un- 
der at prefent. To fet them fuddenly free here 
would be perhaps attended with no lefs Difficulty, 
for undifcipiined as they arc in Religion and Virtue, 
they might give a loofe to thofc evil Habits, which 
the Fear of a Mailer would have reftrained. Thefc

duce them to'^malce Incurfions upon the Neighbouring Dif-

they difpofe of to the Europeans, in Exchange for fuch Cora- 
inodities as they want.

are Difficulties in the Way ; nor can any general 
Change be made, or Reformation effected without 
fome : But the Difficulties are not fo great but 
that they may be furmounted. It the Govern- 
ment was lb fenfible of the Iniquity and Danger

tjf any Slave's Servitude, upon legal proof, beings 
made, of that Slave's having wilfully negledled his 
Duty. Let every Slave thus fet free be enrolled 
in the CountyCourt, and obliged to be a Refident 
during a certain Number of Years within the faid 
County, under the Infpedion of the Overfeers of 
the Poor. Thus being in fome Sort ilill under the 
Diredions of Governors, and Notice of thofe who 
were formerly acquainted with them, they would 
be obliged to ad circumfpe6lly, and to make a pro- 
per Ufe of their Liberty; and their Children have 
an Opportunity of fuch Inilrudtion as might be 
provided for them, under the Tuition of proper 
Iilflrudors ; thus both Parents and Children might 
grow up to be ufeful Members of the Communi- 
ty. And further, where the Nature of the Coun- 
try would permit, as certainly the uncultivated 
Condition of our Southern Colonies eafily would ; 
fuppofe a fmall Trad of Land, for Inftance, five 
and twenty Acres were affigned to every Negro 
Family, and they obliged to live upon and im- 
prove it (when not hired out to v/ork for the 
Whites) this would encourage them to exert their 
Abilities, and become induftrious Subjeds : Thus 
both Planters and Tradefmen would be plentifully 
fupplied with chearful and willing-minded Labour- 
ers j much vacant Land would be cultivated ; the 
Produce of the Country greatly encreafed ; Arts 
and Man ufadu res advanced; the Taxes for the 
Support of Government IciTened to Individuals, 
by the encreafe of Taxables. And the Negroes

The miitaken Opinion, which nnoft People have 
entertained, that the Negroes in Africa^ live in 
the fame wild unfettled Manner as the American 
Indians do, has led many to think it impoflibie to 
bring them into that civilized Order which is requi- 
fite for their becoming good Members of Society, 
but, it is hoped, what has already been faid on that 
Head, will convince the candid Reader, that this 
Opinion is founded on miftaken Apprehenfions 5 
and to put this Matter in a yet clearer Light, it 
may not be amifs to add, that altho' amongft the 
many Nations living on that Part of Africa^ inha* 
bited by the Negroes, which extend many Thou- 
land Miles^ there is doubtiefs fome People of a 
more favage Difpofition than others, yet certain it 
is, that the natural Difpofition of the Generahty of 
the Negroes is widely different from the roving 
Difpofitions of our Indians; they generally fettle 
together, and employ themfelves in Agriculture 
and Commerce. Some large Nations are repre- 
fcnted as induftrious and careful in the Cultivation 
of their Lands; breeding Cattle, and carrying on 
a Trade to diilant Parts. An Inftance of this ap- 
pears from the Account we have of the principal 
Nations, fettled back of the Fadories of Goree and 
Senegal^ Places of great Trade, in the Latitude 
cf i 5 to 20 Degrees North, lately taken by the 
Englijh from the French^ from whence great Num-

and the great Dilproportion between them and the white Peo-

bers of Slaves have for a long Time been Yearly 
exported to the Plantations. In the 2d Vol. of the 
CoUedion, we are told that this Country, which is 
fituate between the River Senegal and Gambia^ and 
extends many Hundreds of Miles, is chiefly inhabit- 
ed by three Negroe Nations, viz. The Mandigos, 
the Fully s^ and the Jalofs : Andrew Brue^ the gene- 
ral Diredor, often beforementioned, fays, the 
Mandigos are difperfed all over the Country, they 
are the moft rigid Mahometans among the Ne- 
groes, * they drink no Wine or Brandy, and are 
politer than the other Negroes ; the chief Trade of 
the Country goes thro' their Hands ; they are labo- 
rious and induftrious, keeping their Grounds well 
cultivated, and breeding a good Stock of Cattle. 

— —Some of thefe People who are fettled up 

the River Senegal^ carry on a Trade to all the 
neighbouring Kingdoms ; and by thefe Means amafs 
Riches, and propagate the Mahometan Religion 

wherefoever they go- The Author agrees 

they are a good Sort of People, honeft, induftri- 
ous, and very ready to learn Arts and Sciences.

Senegal', their Country, which is very fruitful and 
populous, extends near four Hundred Miles from 
Eaft to Welti They are ordinarily of a deep tawny 
Complexion, appearing to bear fome Affinity with 
the Moors^ to whofe Country they join on the 
North. They are a well made People, and the* 
they feem tender, yet they will labour floutly at 
hard Work, are good Farmers, and make great 
Harveils of Corn, Cotton, Tobacco^ Peafe, &c. 
and breed a great Number of Cattle of all Kinds

Bit of Wood, wherein the LeiTons are written with a Kind of 
black ink, and a Pen like a Pencil. They not only teach 
Schools but rove about the Country, teaching and inilrufting

Other Negroes to take care of Cattle, ^c, t Some 
of thefe Fully Blacks, who dwell on both Sides the 
River Gambia are in Subjedion to the Mandigos^ 
amongil whom they have fettled from Time to 
Time; having been, probablv, driven out of their 
own Country by War or Famine. They have 
Chiefs of their own, vv^ho rule with much Modera- 
tion. They live in Clans, build Towns, and are 
Qot fubjed to any Kings of the Country, though 
they live in their Territories; for if they are ill- 
treated by one Nation, they break up their Town 
and remove to another. They are alfo flrid Ma- 
hometans^ few amongil them will drink Brandy, or 
any Thing ftronger than Water and Sugar: Their 
Form of Government goes on eafy, becaufe the 
People are of a good quiet Dirpofition, and fo well 
inftruded in what is juft and right, that a Man 
who does ill is the Abomination of all, and none 
will fupport him againfc the Chiefs. In thefe 
Countries the Natives are not covetous of Land, 
defiring no more than what they ufe ; and as they 
do not plough with Horfes and Cactle, they can 
life but very little, therefore the Kings, are willing 
to give the Fullf^ leave to live in their Countries, 
and cultivate Lands. They plant Tobacco near, 
their Houfes, and Cotton all round their Towns, 
Yvhich they fence in together-, beyond that they 
fow Indian and Guinea Corn and Rice : As ihey are 
iadulirious and frug:i], they have more Corn and 
Cotton than they coniume, which they fell at rea- 
fonable Rates : Their Clothing is of white Cotton

of their own Manufa6ture : They are a clean Peo- 
ple, efpecially the Women. As they are hofpita- 
ble and kind to all, it is reckoned a Bleffing to 
have a F/^//y Town in the Neighbourhood: They 
never luffer any of their own Nation to want, 
but fupport the Old, the Blind, and the Lame •, 
and as far as their Abilities goes fupply theNecefll- 
ties of the Mandigos^ great Numbers of whom they 
have maintained in Famines. They are rarely an* 
gry, and the Author could never hear them abufe 
one another. 

In the Colle<5l:ion, we have alfo a favorable Ac- 
count of the Conduct and Difpofition of a Num- 
ber of free Negroes fettled on the Cape Ferd l^ldinds, 
The Account is principally taken from the Wri- 
tings of George Roberts^ wlio was Shjpwreck'd on 
one of thofe Ifiands; they are ten in Number,, the 
largeR- called St. Jcigo^ is fettled by the Portuguefe'^ 
the reil are moftly inhabited by Negroes or Mulat- 
toes, which our Author fays happened in the fol- 
lowing M^inner, viz, " The Portuguefe fettled on 
♦' the two largeft Ifiands, provided themfelvcs 
*^ with Negroe- Slaves from Guinea to do their 
«« Work; and as it was ufual with them to atone 
*' -for their Sins on their Death-bed, by giving one 
^' or more Slaves their Freedom, thefe F'ree- 
'' Blacks, being in a Climate natural to them, in- 
^' creafed fad; many became Tenants to the 
*' Whites, others not brooking their lordly and 
'' oppreiiive Deportment, went over to the ielTer 
*' Illands. Thefe lelTer lilands having been bef- 
*^ towed by the King to fome of his Nobles : 
^^ They appoint deputy Governors, who are gene- 
^' rally Negroes." Their Priefts are alio Negroes, 
V/lio {Roberts fays) ^« make better and Toberer 

1' Clergy mcA 



[ 77 ] . 

" Clergymen than the Whites, thefe being moilly 
*' of looie and vicious Lives, which caufed the 
*' Bifhop, who was a Man of a meek and mild 
" Difpofition, to prefer the Blacks with no more 
" Education than what they could have at Sf, 
^' 7^?^<?' This (adds the Author) was a commen- 
" dable Practice of the Bifhop; who met with a 
" great deal of Trouble on that Account, from 
*^ the Frya.rs, who made a-Pradice of ridiculing 
^^ the Ignorance of thefe Negroe-Priefts." The 
Portuguefe Inhabitants of thofe Illands are faid (in 
the Colledlion) to bear but a poor Character, being 
generally reprefented as a proud, lazy, ignorant 
People^ but on the Contrary, the Free-Negroes, 
who are much the greateft Number, are faid to be 
moilly an innocent good tempered People. Roberts 
fpeaks particularly v^^ell of the Black Governor of 
Bonavifta^ and of Captain Domingo^ a fenfible 
Black on that Ifland, who v/as a fair Dealer, and 
could read French and EnglifJj. The Governor, 
Pried and People of the Ifland of A%t7, were all 
Negroes, tho' being fubjed: to the Portugiisfe^ they 

had their Religion and Language-^- Captain 

Dampier^ who was on this Ifland many Years before 
Roberts^ fays, " The Governor had his Patent 
" from the Governor of 6"/. Jago-, that the Negro 
^[ Vv^ho held that Office in the Year 1^99 was a ve- 
^' ry civil, feniible Man, and, adds, that the In- 
^' habitants were generally a good Sort of People, * 

» that 

* " Damphr exprefTes his Concern at the Abufe thefe poor 
^* People had received from the Crew of a Brijiol VefTel, v,'ho 
*' going Afiiore under pretence of Friendlhip, feized on the 
" Governor, with foiue others, and carrying them on board, 
" made them fend to Land for Cattle to ranfom their Liber- 
" ties : Yet after this failed away with them, and poflibly, fays 
<^ th? Author, never brought them again. 



[ 78 J 

« that they looked well, being fat and flelhy, 
« tho' the Ifland appears fo barren to a Stranger, 
" as fcarce to have Food for its Inhabitants.'* 
The Ifland upon which Roberts was Shipwreck'd 
was called St. John', it was wholly inhabited by 
Blacks, he fays, that tho' very ignorant and fuper- 
ilitious, yet they were the mofc innocent and harm- 
lefs of all thofe lilanders. He fpeaks highly of 
their moral Virtue, efp^cially their Charity, Hu- 
mility and Hofpitahty : He particularly commends 
their Veneration for Age. While he lay fick he 
was lodged by one of the chief Inhabitants, and 
fupplied with ail kind of NecefTaries : Every Day 
fome or other would come to fee how he did, and 
fcarce ever without a Fowl, or fome Fruit for him : 
They fliewed him great Kindnefs in every other 
Refpe6t, and freely affifted him in building a fmall 
Vellel to carry him off the Ifland, when he talked 
of making them a- Return for thefe Favours, they 
faid, they were glad they had been of any Service 
to him, • and thought it their Duty to ferve Strangers 
in Diftrefs. 

Upon the V/hole, of what has been faid, it mAiIl 
appear to every honeil unprejudiced Reader, that 
the Negroes are equally intituled to the common 
Priviledges of Mankind with the Whites, that they 
have the fame rational Powers ♦, the fame natural 
Affections, and are as fufceptible of Pain and 
Grief as they, that therefore the bringing and 
keeping them in Bondage, is an Inilance 
of Oppreffion and Injuftice of the moft grie- 
Gus Nature, fuch as is fcarcely to be paral- 
lelled by any Example in the preient . or former 
Ages. Many of its woful Efiedts have already 
been expreiTed, but thofe v/hich more particularly 

calls

calls for the Notice and Redrefs of the Goverri- 
ment, arifes from its inconfiilancy with every 
Thing that is juil and humane, whence the worft 
Effe6ts naturally flow to the Religion and Morals 
of the People where it prevails. Its deltru6tive 
Confequences to labouring People, and Trades- 
men is no lefs worthy the Attention of thofe who 
have Inclination and Power to ferve their Country. 
This Rank of People, as they are the chief Strength 
and Support of a Community; fo their Situation 
and Welfare calls for the particular Care of every 
prudent Government; but where Slave-keeping 
prevails, their Places and Services being fupplied 
by the Negroes, they find themfelves flighted, dif- 
regarded, and robbed of the natural Oppertuni- 
ties of Labour common in other Countries, where- 
by they are much difcouraged and their Families 
often reduced to Want: To which may be added 
the Difcouragementalfo given by this Trade to many 
poor People, that can fcarce get Bread in our Mo- 
ther Country, who, if not prevented, on Account 
of the great Number of Negroes, would be likely 
to come over into the Colonies where they might, 
with Eafe, procure to themfelves a more comfor- 
table Living than at Home. Another direful Ef- 
fect arifes from the fearful Apprehenflons and 
Terrors which often feize the Minds of the People, 
for the Suppreflion of which the mofl: cruel Me- 
thods are purfued, fuch as are indeed a Reproach 
to Chriftianity, and will by Degrees harden the 
Hearts of thofe who are adive therein, fo as totally 
to exclude them from that Tender nefs and Sym- 
pathy for the Sufl^erings of their Fellow Creatures^ 
which conflitutes the Happinefs of Sqciety, and is 
the Glory of intelligent Beings. As for the Pof-

felTors" of the Negroes thcmfelves, though tlie 
Sumptuoufners and Eafe in which they live, and 
the Attendance and Obfequioufnefs of their Slaves, 
may raife in their Minds an imagined Apprehenfi- 
on of their being Perfons more happy, and of 
greater Importance than other People, who do live 
in the like Affluence and State; yet happy would 
it be if they were fenfible how great is their Mif- 
take, and could be perfuaded ferioufly to confi- 
der and apply the Parable of the rich Man and 
poor Lazarus^ mentioned by our Saviour, where- 
by they might plainly perceive that they have no 
Caufe to exult, becaufe of their Power and Plenty, 
but have rather Occafion to mourn over themfelves, 
their Children, and their Country*, the natural 
Effedl of their Situation being fuch as has been re- 
peatedly obferved. " To fill Men with Haughtinsfs^ 
" Tyranny^ Luxury and Barbarity ; corrupting the 
" Minds^ and dehafing the Morals of their Children^
