NEGRO EMANCIPATION 

A DIALOGUE 

BETWEEN MR. EBENEZER EASTLOVE 

AND 

GILES HOMESPUN. 



Scene — A Parlour in the White Hart Inn, 
at , in shire. 

Eastlove, seated near a Table, which is 
covered with Pamphlets, Handbills, Manu- 
scripts, 8^c, S§c. 

Eastlove, solus. 

Petitions we shall obtain — our method 
is sure — no general meetings — hand- 
bills, placards, and active emissaries; 
that is the way. — Yet the colonists have 



4 

bestirred themselves — it was to be ex- 
pected — loss of income they endured 
patiently enough — but hope was still 
left to them — good times might return, 
and, while the capital was preserved, 
their case was not quite desperate. If 
we succeed, as I trust we shall, in our 
present effort, there is at once an end 
of their property — scarce a wreck of 
it will remain — and then — yes, then, 
we have the field to ourselves. Free 
negroes will not make sugar — that is 
certain. But Churmars, Panicars, the 
Bocadaru and Batadaru Castes, with 
other Eastern labourers (for we will not 
call them slaves^ )^ will, if proper stimu-

lants be used, amply supply our markets 
with that necessary of life. 

To be sure, this doctrine of compen- 
sation to the colonists is an awkward 
obstacle. Barham's statement on that 
point makes a deep impression. Why 

does not S come forward with his 

pamphlet, and ingeniously shew that 
they can establish no such claim ? Does 
he suspect that his arguments are too 
subtle for British plain-dealing ? How- 
ever, although we may cautiously admit 
the principle — (as, in some places, we 
could not get on without doing so) — 
we may so puzzle the claim, and tack 
to it such conditions, as will make its 
operation insignificant; and, cost what 
it may, the great work shall be done ! 
Let us but generate enthusiasm enough 






in the powerful names of humanity and 
justice, and, the greater the sacrifices 
we demand, the more eagerly will they 
be made! 

I have sent for Friend Homespun — 
he is well disposed, and has much 
shrewdness and plain good sense — he 
was very useful to us la^ year — Oh, 
here he comes ! 

Friend Giles, I am glad to see 
thee — thy wife and children are well, 
I hope? And how goes it with the 
farm? 

Giles Homespun. ' 

Thank you kindly, Master Eastlove — 
we are all bravely ; and farming, bad as 
it is, has somewhat mended since I saw 



you. I reckon, by all those papers 
before you, that you are here again on 
the same errand as last year? 

Eastlove. 

Thou art right, Friend Homespun; 
and I crave once more thy zealous and 
able support in the furtherance of 
another petition to Parliament for the 
humane purpose of setting free the 
wretched slaves in our colonies. 

Homespun. 

I believe, Master Eastlove, that I 
shall neither sign nor further it. 

Eastlove. 

Friend Giles, I am astonished at what 
thou hast uttered! — Hast thou, then.

been communing with certain slave- 
holders who dwell in thy neighbourhood? 



Ho 



MESPUN. 



No — believe me, no; — you mean, 
perhaps, Mr. Plantain and Mr. Sugar- 
cane ?— They are very quiet good gen- 
tlemen, and spend their money, when- 
ever they get it, like princes. We have 
all of us hereabouts been the better for 
them at one time or other; but they 
don't seem to busy themselves about 
what you are doing, much as it con- 
cerns them. I have had no talk with 
them at all about this matter ; but, soon 
after you carried away our petition, 
there was, you know, a debate in the 
House of Commons upc»n it, and I have 



9 

had some discourse with Mr. Manly 
and with Squire Oldcastle, our mem- 
bers, concerning what then passed. 

Eastlove. 

Well, Giles, and what then ? Surely 
those liberal men did not advocate the 
horrid slave system of our colonies ? 

Homespun. 

Master Eastlove, I have half an hour 
to spare, and don't object to telling you 
what has passed in my mind since I 
talked with our members ; and I will 
listen to what you may have to say on 
the other side. I guess that your pe- 
tition this year, like that last year, is not 
to pray that no more slaves may be 
carried, either from Africa or from any 



10 

other parts, into our colonies ; for if such 
a petition as that were necessary, I'd 
go to John-o'-Groat's house to sign it. 

Eastlove. 

Giles, thou knowest, as well as I 
do, that this country has abolished the 
African Slave Trade, and I must grant 
(since it seems to be proved) that our 
colonies have now no concern in it; 
but surely, Giles, thou wilt allow that 
the great labour of humanity is not 
complete till all British subjects, be 
they black or white, are emancipated, 
and a system of heathenish irreligion 
and immxorality, (as Friend Wilberforce 
aptly terms it), of unprecedented degra- 
dation and unrelenting cruelty, be ut- 
terly and for ever abolished. 




11 



Homespun. 

Stop a little, Master Eastlove, you 
move on at a great pace. There are in 
our colonies, as I understand, about 
800,000 of these black slaves. 

Eastlove. 
Alas, Friend Giles, it is too true ! 

HoMESPuisr. 

And all these have lived in slavery- 
all their lives. 

Eastlove. 

I can t quite admit that Giles ; some 

^ ^' * of the oldest of them might be powerful 

men in Africa; ay, nobles and princes. 




n 



Homespun. 

IVe heard that matter talked over, 
and IVe read what Mr. Manly shewed 
me about it; — I think you may let that 
argument rest; — African princes and 
nobles, (if it be true that any of that sort 
have been carried to our colonies,) have 
no great hold on my compassion. 

Eastlove. 

But this, Giles, thou wilt not deny, 
that slaves although they be, and slaves 
although they may have been born, they 
have not sold themselves, and they 
could not sell their offspring to slavery; 
have they not then a right to their 
freedom ? 



15 



Homespun. 

Master Eastlove, I don't deny their 
natural right to freedom. 

Eastlove. 

Then, Friend Giles, there is an end of 
the question ; for the petition, to which 
I ask thy support, only prays that Parlia- 
ment will do what is just, and give to 
these wretched beings what is their 
right. 

Homespun. 

IVe somewhat to say about what is 
right and just to all parties, Master 
Eastlove ; but may be youll think me a 
strange fellow if I can't allow that, be- 
cause the slaves have that natural right 



14 

which you speak of, it would, therefore, 
be either wise, or just, or humane, that 
parliament should all at once put them 
in possession of it. 

Eastlove. 

Giles, Giles, thy honest mind has been 
perverted ; thou knowest that we do not 
pray for immediate emancipation; we 
ask that the thing may be done discreetly^ 
but that, at all events, it may be done. 

Homespun. 

Master Eastlove, you'll beat me at 
close argument I am sure ; but let me 
tell you that you are now admitting that 
a government may be justified in with- 
holding, in some cases, from a man that 
which is his natural right. 



15 

Eastlove. 

Yes; but with the fixed purpose of 
delivering it to him, as soon as it can 
possibly be done, without material injury 
to himself. 

Homespun. 

No matter ; still it is admitted by you 
that the delivery of their freedom to the 
negroes, their natural right to which 
you acknowledge in the outset, is not to 
depend upon their own discretion, but 
upon the will and discretion of others ; 
and I don't ask you for any other ground 
than this for my objections to your pro- 
ceedings. 

Eastlove. 
Explain thyself, I pray thee. 



16 



Homespun. 

I understand, from our members, that 
one of the King's Ministers, in the House 
of Commons*, admitted all you can ask 
regarding the rights of all men, black 
and white, to be free. He gave a pledge 
to the House that it should be the anxious 
care of Ministers to urge the West Indian 
governments to such measures as would 
best contribute to the present comfort 
of the negroes, and also to their religious 
and moral instruction, so as gradually 
to fit them for the full enjoyment of 
freedom ; and he declared that in con- 
ceding freedom to the slaves, the rights

Canning, on the 15th of May, 1823. 



IT 

of property should be considered and 
respected. Now it seems to me. Master 
Eastlove, that this was getting as much 
by our petitions as we had any right to 
expect; and that it is a little unreason- 
able to be again so soon wishing to hurry 
on measures, which, you yourself have 
just granted, must be done with great 
discretion and caution to be done welL 

Eastlove. 

Giles, thou hast touched the sore 
place: those West Indian legislatures 
have done nothing, will do nothing ! 

Homespun. 

Why that's what you said last year, 
and what all your printed books say; 
but I have been reading something on 



18 

the other side*; and there I find facts 
asserted, upon good authority, which 
prove quite the contrary, — that a great 
deal has been done and is doing, — that 
negroes are well clothed and fed, nursed 
when sick, and supported when old 
and helpless, ay, and kindly used and 
instructed, — besides, now that Parlia- 
ment has spoken so plainly, one may 
expect that, if you'll give those peppery 
gentlemen in the West Indies a little 
time to cool, they will follow up what 
they have done already with new spirit 
and activity. Til tell you fairly, Masteir 
Eastlove, I'm inclined to meddle no 
more in the matter, at least for the 
present. 

* See List of Pamphlets appended to this Tract. 



19 



Eastlove. 

Art thou then so hardened as to look 
patiently on and suffer thy poor black 
fellow subjects to be driven like brute 
beasts, by the scourge of the cart whip, 
to hard labour ? Canst thou endure that 
the oppressive, cruel, and immoral acts, 
of which our books shew thee numerous 
instances, shall continue to be practised 
with impunity? Oh, Giles, Giles ! where 
are those humane feelings which only a 
few^ months ago animated thy exertions 
in our cause ? 

Homespun. 

Master Eastlove, I feel as I did — 
I have just the same horror of cruelty 
and detestation of slavery, — the evil is 



20 

great enough, though not, as I now 
think, quite so great as you have repre- 
sented it. I find that you have picked 
out and put together all the horrid tales, 
whether old or new, that suited your 
purpose ; but were the case ever so bad, 
still we must not aim to cure it by doing 
wliat will only make it worse. One 
would wish, to be sure, that there was 
no flogging either of negroes, or sailors, 
or soldiers ; but we agree that the ne- 
groes are not to be made free all at once 
and immediately, and I'm afraid they 
cannot be managed well, even as re- 
spects themselves, so long as they con- 
tinue slaves, without corporal punish- 
ment. But tell me, however, honestly, 
— there are in Jamaica, I hear, almost 
400,000 people, black, brown, and 



21 

whi+e, and nine-tenths of them, or there- 
abouts, are slaves, — do you think that, 
in any year you can name, there are 
more horrid crimes committed in that 
island than in many portions of Great 
Britain and Ireland, containing just the 
same number of inhabitants ? You read 
our newspapers, I dare say, and mind a 
little what is passing both here and in 
Ireland. 

Eastlove. 

Friend Giles, thou forgettest that in 
Jamaica nine-tenths of the population 
are, as thou hast just admitted, sub- 
jected to the oppressive power of the 
slave-master — almost without protection 
from law, since laws, which profess to 
protect the slave, are not executed. 

n 



22 

Here, and in Ireland too, horrid acts 
occasionally occur; but mark the dif- 
ference, they are prosecuted and pu- 
nished. 

Homespun. 

Why, in my thinking, the use of 
punishment is to prevent crimes; and 
if it be found out that here, in this 
country, with all our laws and tribunals, 
we are growing worse and worse, and 
that in the West Indies they are, though 
it be but by slow steps, becoming better 
and better, I can't but conclude that 
we might find other matters nearer 
home that deserve our looking after 
quite as well as what is passing in the 
Colonies. But there's another objection 
in my mind to our further meddling at 




23 

present : there's danger, I think, of stir- 
ring up the negroes to risings and rebel- 
lions, which can only end in the destruc- 
tion both of them and of their masters. 

Eastlove. 

Friend Giles, I thought thee too wise 
to be caught in that snare. Did we 
not predict that these terrors would be 
artfully excited, and that plots would 
be got up for the purpose?* 

Homespun. 

For one that is going about on an 
errand of charity, is that charge quite 
consistent, Master Eastlove ? Do people

See Note x. page 227. 



.24 

get up plots, which are to destroy their 
own property and endanger their own 
lives ? 

Eastlove. 

Insurrections, Giles, must and will 
occur, where oppression is the spirit 
that rules. They are the inevitable re- 
sults of that detestable system. 

Homespun. 

Ay, are they so ? These late risings, 
then, in Barbadoes and Demarara, have 
been caused, as you think, by oppres- 
sion and cruelty to the slaves ? 

Eastlove. 
Perhaps not; but — — 




25 

Homespun. 
. Pardon me. Master Eastlove — just 
hear what it is I want to know — you 
see they can rise if they have a sufficient 
motive ? 

Eastlove. 

Doubtless ; but, alas ! poor deluded 
sufferers 

Homespun. 

Now, why, if the oppression on them 
be so severe and so constant as you 
say it is, have they not been rising here 
and there in some parts of the West 
Indies from that cause only ? I cannot 
find that they have done so — but let 
them only be told that something is 
going on at home that is to overrule 
their masters, and up they are in arms 
in one colony or ancither. 



26 

Eastlove. 
Oppression, Giles — long - continued 
oppression, stupifies the man and ex- 
tinguishes hope; but let a ray of hope 
break in upon the gloom in which 
these wretched beings are plunged, and 
they are suddenly animated to exertions 
for the recovery of their rights. 

Homespun. 

But you have admitted that they are 
not themselves able to judge at what 
time, and by what degrees, their rights 
ought to be put into their possession. 
You profess, in many of your writings, 
that sudden and unprepared emancipa- 
tion would be their destruction. How 
then can you, Master Eastlove, recon- 
cile it with true humanity, to be holding 
r t ' ' ^-m such hopes nnd rays of 



light, as you call them, which have been 
found to be the surest means of rousing 
them into rebellion^ and to end in their 
destruction? Would it not be better to 
let instruction go on, and that thej^ 
should, step by step, advance in their 
fitness for liberty? Such, I must tell 
you, is my opinion; and, as I feel 
satisfied that the good work is going 
on, I will have nothing to do with your 
petitions this year. 

Eastlove. 

I have done with thee, Giles. — I will 
strike thy name out of our Society. 

Homespun. 

With all my heart, do so. I have 
understood, Master Eastlove, that if the 



28 

worst come to the worst with the West 

Indies, you may find some consolation 

in other quarters and other concerns — 

as for me^ I have no such prospects. 

I hope the Colonies will be saved from 

ruin — I know many places and persons 

that will grievously suffer if it be not 

so — and as it is plain enough that the 

Colonists have Acts of Parliament on 

their side for all they have done, I feel 

certain, that, if we injure their property, 

we must indemnify them for it — and 

God forbid that we should be doing 

that which will at once add to our 

taxes, and take away from our means 

of paying them ! 

lEdt Homespun. 

THE END.
