Note. — The following lines were written for 
the amusement of the author's acquaintance, 
without the most remote idea of their ever ap- 
pearing in other than manuscript form. But a 
number of his friends being desirous of having a 
copy, he has complied with their request to have 
a small edition printed — not published. 

He hopes it is hardly necessary to say that 
whatever of unpalatable truth may be found in 
some of the stanzas, he wrote them with no un- 
kindly feelings ; and he would be sorry to think 
that any should be in the least offended by his 
remarks. The spirit of pleasantry with which 
they have been received by some who have the 
most cause to complain, (if cause there be,) leads 
him to believe that those who find less to offend, 
will not be more irritable or unreasonable.

DANIEL L. MILLER, JR. 

Tho' little, yet Dan, 

Thou art a great man. 
At least in thy own estimation ; 

Thou thinkest, no doubt, 

We could not without 
Thy aid, produce this agitation, 

Little Dan ! 
Thy aid, produce this agitation. 

JOSEPH HEALY. 

Joe Healy, Joe Healy, 
Speak quick and genteely 

Whenever thy say must be said ; 
Put on some more steam, 
Thy words should not seem 

As from one half asleep or half dead, 
Joe Healy ! 

As from one half asleep or half dead.

NATHAN STEM. 

Nathan Stem, Nathan Stem, 

Thou hast come out from them, 
Who would fetter the heart and the tongue ; 

Thou hast opened thy mouth 

For the slaves of the south, 
And shown to the nation their wrong, 
Nathan Stem ! 
And shown to the nation their wrong. 

BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL. 

And thou, Dr. Fussell, 

A terrible bustle 
Is seen when thy person appears ; 

Tho' the nation is ill, 

She loves not thy pill, 
Then why set us all by the ears 1 

Say, Doctor ! 
Then why set us all by the ears 1 

LUCRETIA MOTT. 
Like the serpent and dove, 
Thou hast wisdom and love ; 
Thy faith by thy deeds is shown forth. 
Thy liberal mind 
Chains of sect cannot bind ; — 
Thy sect is the righteous of earth, 

Lucretia ! 
Thy sect is the righteous of earth. 



[ 7 ] 

GEORGE SELLERS. 

George Sellers, to me, 

It is pleasant to see 
The veteran of three-score and ten, 

Uniting with youth 

In defence of the truth, 
With the vigor of manhood again, 

As in thee ! 
With the vigor of manhood again. 

ELIZABETH J. NEALL. 

Lizzy Neall, Lizzy Neall, 

Some aver that they feel 
Much shocked thou art not more refined : 

Such grumblers heed not. 

Express freely each thought ; 
Let sincerity dw^ell with thy mind. 

As it does ! 
Let sincerity dwell with thy mind. 

BENJAMIN S. JONES. 
Benny Jones, Benny Jones, 
What disconsolate tones ! 
Do cheer up, and drive off " the blues ;" 
Pray, when didst thou see 
The good folks at Darby ] — 
How are they, and what is the news 1 
Say Benny ! 
How are they, and what is the news 1

ABRAHAM L. PENNOCK. 

What, Abraham ! thou here, 

A grave overseer 
Advice of the meeting thus scorning ! 
'Tis sad, very sad ; 
The example is bad ; 
By Wall, Gove, and Bassett take warning, 

Friend Pennock ! 
By Wall, Gove, and Bassett take warning. 

MARY GREW. 

Mary Grew, Mary Grew, 

Thou hast ever proved true 
To the cause of the down-trodden poor ; 

And He, in whose name 

Thou hast given to them. 
Will make thy reward good and sure, 
Mary Grew ! 
Will make thy reward good and sure. 

THOMAS WHITSON. 

Friend Whitson, friend Whitson, 

Like « dunder and blitzen" 
Thy fists and thy words both come down ; 

A diamond thou art, 

Tho' unpolished each part. 
Yet worthy a place in the crown. 

Friend Whitson ! 
Yet worthy a place in the crown. 



[ 9 ] 

JOHN G. WHITTIER. 

John Whittier, too ! 

Why how do thee do 1 
Are thee going to give us a speech 1 

I fear, brother John, 

If 'twas even begun 
The midway thou never couldst reach, 
Johnny G. ! 
The midway thou never couldst reach. 

SAMUEL J. LEVICK. 

Why Sam, thou Don Quixotte ! 

How else could we fix it 
Politicians to carry along 1 

« Spur briskly that side 

" Where morals abide, 
« And 'tother will never go wrong" 

Says Levick ! 
" And 'tother will never go wrong." 

DANIEL NEALL. 

Daniel Neall, Daniel Neall, 

'Twill be pleasant to feel. 
When covered with feathers and tar. 

Our feet have like thine, 

Kept close to the line. 
And faithfully followed truth's star, 

Daniel Neall ! 
And faithfully followed truth's star.

SARAH PUGH. 

Sarah Pugh, Sarah Pugh, 

As a small tribute due, 
To kind disposition and worth ; 

We wish that thy brow 

May reflect back the glow, 
Thy kindness has cast upon earth, 

Sarah Pugh ! 
Thy kindness has cast upon earth. 

CHARLES WISE. 

Charley Wise, Charley Wise, 

'Tis no cause of surprise. 
Thou dealest in « free goods" so plenty 

Be candid, and tell 

If on all that thou sell 
There's fifteen cents profit in twenty, 
Charley Wise I 
There's fifteen cents profit in twenty. 

PETER WRIGHT. 

Shell it out, Peter Wright, 
'Tis a heart-cheering sight 

-To see men of wealth freely giving ; 
Come, pull out thy purse, 
Thou wilt not be the worse 

If thou givest a tithe of thy living, 

Peter Wright ! 

If thou givest a tithe of thy living. 



[ 11 ] 

CHARLES W. GARDNER. 

Tho' darkened thy brow- 
By the sun's fervid glow, 

A spirit enlightened dwells there, — 
God prosper thy toil. 
And enrich well the soil 

Of hearts thou hast tilled with much care. 
Friend Gardner ! 

Of hearts thou hast tilled with much care. 

JAMES FORTEN. 

James Forten, right well 

I love to hear tell, 
Of thy aid in our much boasted war ; 

And mark with what scorn. 

Does thy noble heart spurn 
The friends of Liberia's shore, 

James Forten ! 
The friends of Liberia's shore. 

ELI DILLIN. 

Friend Eli, a bank. 

In thy nostrils is rank — 
Almost — as is slavery's self ; 

Both seem unto thee 

Great "Monsters" to be ; — 
This, robs us of rights — that, of pelf, 

Friend Dillin ! 
This, robs us of rights — that, of pelf. 



[ 12 ] 

JAMES RHOADS. 
Hast thou ever, James Khoads, 
Heard of half-living toads, 
That for hundreds of years slept in stone 
Will the simile fit, 
Or at fault is my wit 1 
Has thy share of the labor been done, 
James Rhoads ! 
Has thi/ share of the labor been done 1 

JAMES FULTON, JR. 

Jim Fulton, don't harm us, 

Nor farther alarm us ; 
Thou art in a terrible take. 

What on earth is the matter ? 

Such a tre-men-dous clatter 
No ten common mouth-pieces make, 

Jim Fulton ! 
No ten common mouth-pieces make. 

LINDLEY COAXES. 

Pray Lindley, don't vex one 

By asking a question, 
That answered, upsets his own side ; 

'Tis very perplexing, 

And shamefully vexing, 
For one's self to prove he has lied, 

'Tis, Friend Coates ! 
For one's self to prove he has lied. 



[ 13 ] 

JOSHUA COFFIN. 

Come Joshua, come, 

Make thyself quite at home ; — 
What musty old book hast thou got 1 

" A very rare work 

" By Sid Hamet, a Turk, 
« At a book-stand I met with and bought, 

« 'Tother day ! 
« At a book-stand I met with and bought." 

MARY NEEDLES, 
That's right, Mary, right ! 
I like such a sight ; — 
If women will leap from their sphere. 
Propriety mocking. 
And modesty shocking. 
Both <' Needles" and stockings bring here, 

Do, Mary ! 
Both « Needles" and stockings bring here. 

THOMAS HOBSON. 

Thomas Hobson, be still ; 

Or if flourish thou will. 
With logic don't murder us quite ; — 

For 'tis a great shame. 

Thou, of chop-logic fame ! 
Shouldst kill and destroy us outright, 

Tom Hobson ! 
Shouldst kill and destroy us outright. 



[ 14 ] 

RALPH SMITH. 

'< If the President please, 

" My mind it will ease, 
" If I jist a few sentences say ;" 

Why Ralph, is that thou ! 

Pray, how dost thou do 1 
" Werry well, — 'Tis a werry warm day, 

" Werry warm ! 
« Werry well, — -Tis a werry warm day. 

UEWIS C. GUNN. 
Lewis Gunn, Lewis Gunn, 
I declare it is fun. 
To see where thy vanity leads ; 
When once it is started. 
From common sense parted 
It limits nor barrier heeds, 

Lewis Gunn ! 
It limits nor barrier heeds. 

WILLIAM C. BRADLEY. 

Will Bradley, Will Bradley, 

The church used thee sadly ; 
Decreeing, without its permission, 

It would be ungrateful, 

A heresy hateful, 
To preach or defend abolition, 

Will Bradley ! 
To preach or defend abolition. 



[ 15 ] 

SARAH LEWIS. 

Sarah L., Sarah L., 

Thy speeches are well ; 
But when others differ in thought, 

Don't press them too hard 

And insist on some word 
Or sentence that benefits not, 

Sarah L. ! 
Or sentence that benefits not. 

EDWARD M. DAVIS. 

Ned Davis, Ned Davis, 

There's none so close shave us 
As thou, with thy financial razor ; 

Tho' tight we may lock it, 

Thou openest the pocket. 
With « Five or ten dollars you pay, sir, 

« For the slave !" 
With " Five or ten dollars you pay, sir." 

SAMUEL WEBB. 

Ship ahoy ! have a care 

Captain Webb, and steer clear 
Of the breakers that gather around ; 

Put the helm quick about. 

Thy cargo heave out. 
Or the vessel will soon be aground, 

Sammy Webb ! 
Or the vessel will soon be aground. 



[ 16 ] 

THOMAS EARLE. 

Thomas Earle, Thomas Earle, 

Oh, cast not the pearl 
Of our cause in the partisan's trough ; 

When the people discern 

The truth clearly, they'll turn 
From political slops and such stuff, 

Thomas Earle ! 
From political slops and such stuff, 

EDWARD HOPPER. 

Ned Hopper, Ned Hopper, 

'Tis certainly proper 
That all, self-esteeem should possess ; 

But I never could see, 

Why this organ need be 
So large that all others seem less, 

Ned Hopper I 
So large that all others seem less. 

EDWIN H. COATES. 

Edwin Coates, Edwin Coates, 

Don't stuff down our throats. 
Such modest told tales of what " I did ;" 

Thy praise 'twere as well, 

To let other men tell. 
And thus have the labor divided, 

Edwin H ! 
And thus have the labor divided. 



[ n 3 

CHARLES C. BURLEIGH. 

Thy logic is good 

And may not be withstood ; 
Thy eloquence simple and true. 

Could the outer man catch 

Enough neatness to match 
With the inner — 'twere wise so to do, 

Charley^.! 
With the z?z?ier— 'twere wise so to do. 

JOSEPH PICKERING. 

Joe Pickering, attend ! 

I advise as a friend, 
And of course I expect not a fee ; 

It would add to their strength 

If one-tenth of their length, 
Thy speeches in future could be, 

Joe Pickering ! 
Thy speeches in future could be. 

JOSEPH JANNEY. 

Why is it, Joe Janney, 
When there are so many 
Whose minds are as dark as the night ; 
Thy talents have been 
Where they could not be seen 1 
Up Joe, and go forth with thy light, 

And speak out ! 
Up Joe, and go forth with thy light.

[ 18 ] 

JAMES WOOD. 

Jimmy Wood, Jimmy Wood, 

A vast deal of good 
Thou art doing the cause of the slave. 

Did thy brothers but feel 

Such praise-worthy zeal, 
What a glorious trio we'd have, 

James Wood ! 
What a glorious trio we'd have. 

ALAN CORSON. 
Thy opponents, friend Corson, 
Have got a rough horse on. 
And well may expect to see breakers; 
Thou wearest plain clothes, 
And nobody knows 
What obstinate creatures are Quakers, 
Friend Alan ! 
What obstinate creatures are Quakers. 

LEONARD FLETCHER. 

I've heard, Leonard Fletcher, 

A tre-men-dous stretcher 
Of Cresson's, first opened thy eyes; 

And gave thee to see 

As in truth they should be. 
His glorious humbug and lies. 

Friend Fletcher! 
His glorious humbug and lies. 



[ 19 1 

WILLIAM HARNED. 

Will Harned, thy ear ! 

If " out of their sphere," 
Our women in London would be ; 

Does it not then appear 

To thy vision as clear 
They did wrong in voting for thee 1 

Eh! Harned! 
They did wrong in voting for thee ] 

MARGARET RANDOLPH. 

Margarette, Margarette, 

May we never forget 
The lesson thy meekness has given ; 

But learn as with thee, 

That affliction may be 
A chain that shall bind us to heaven, 
Margarette ! 
A chain that shall bind us to heaven. 

ELIZABETH T. BUNTING. 
I long have been hunting 
For thee, Lizzy Bunting 
An emblem as lovely and fair ; 
As yet I have not 
Found the blossom I sought. 
For heaven's exotics are rare, 

Lizzy B. ! 
For heaven's exotics are rare. 



[ 20 ] 

MARY EARLE. 

Thy satire, Mary, 

Is excellent, very ! 
And pleasing when others are hit ; 

But a different thing 

When we feel the sting, 
-And a target become for thy wit, 

Mary Earle ! 
And a target become for thy wit. 

HENRY PETERSON. 
Harry P., Harry P., 
Thou'rt a puzzle to me, 
« Neither fish, flesh, nor pickled red herring 
Opposing each one, 
And agreeing with none. 
The colors of no party wearing, 

Harry P. ! 
The colors of no party wearing. 

SARAH WEBB. 

The stream of thy life 

Is unruffled by strife, 
Native truth with thee makes her abode ; 

Thou art quietly gay 

As the flowrets of May ; 
And as bright, as retiring and good, 

Gentle " Sis !" 
And as bright, as retiring and good.

LEWIS TAPPAN. 
Prat, how does it happen, 
That thou, Lewis Tappan, 
The warm and true hearted of yore, 
Would woman exclude 
From where long she has stood, 
And successfully plead for God's poor, 

Lewis T. ! 
And successfully plead for God's poor. 

ABBY KELLY. 
<' Miss Kelly of Lynn," 
Some esteem it a sin 
And a shame that thou darest to speak ; 
Quite forgetting that mind 
Is to sex unconfined. 
That in Christ, is nor Gentile nor Greek, 

Abby K. ! 
That in Christ is nor Gentile nor Greek ! 



[ 22 ] 

CHARLES W. DENISON. 
Charles W. D., 
My advice unto thee, 
Is to tell not of lost reputation ; 
For if it is lost, 
'Tis a trifle at most. 
And for sorrow gives little occasion, 
Charley D. ! 
And for sorrow gives little occasion. 

ALANSON ST. CLAIR. 

Alanson St. Clair, 

Last spring was a year, 
« Woman's Rights" were by thee well defended 

Did conscience then lie, 

Or is « all in my eye" 
The scruples she now has pretended, 

St. Clair ! 
The scruples she now has pretended 1 

ORIGEN BACHELOR. 
That thou hast the floor. 
All agree, Bachelor ; 
In vain do we hope for some rest : — 
We thee will anoint 
The true « Point no Point," 
And vote thee a terrible pest. 

Bachelor ! 
And vote thee a terrible pest. 



[ 23 3 

NATHANIEL P. ROGERS. 

Nat Rogers, some fear 

Thou art over severe, 
And would have thee a little more civil ; 

Where is the occasion 

For « New Organization" 
By thee to be yoked with the Devil, 

Natty P. ! 
By thee to be yoked with the Devil ] 

WILLIAM BASSETT. 

William Bassett, this greeting 

Comes up from thy meeting : — 
"In future thy mouth must be closed; 

" For Friends should all feel 

" They had better conceal 
"Their errors, than have them exposed," 

William B. ! 
" Their errors, than have them exposed." 

SAMUEL J. MAY. 

Samuel May, Samuel May, 
Where the green pastures lay, 

And the bright waters peacefully move ; 
Thou ever art found, 
With thy brow circled round 

With a halo of kindness and love, 
Samuel J. ! 

With a halo of kindness and love. 



[ 24 ] 

CHARLES T. TORREY. 
I prophesy, Torrey, 
That thou wilt be sorry, 
And look with a longing eye back 
To where, side by side 
With the faithful and tried, 
Thou hast walked in the old beaten track, 

Charles T. ! 
Thou hast walked in the old beaten track. 

SETH SFRAGUE. 
Father Sprague, age and youth 
Lay claim to thee both, — 
In years thou art aged as many ; 
While a vigor and zeal 
The old rarely feel. 
Make thee seem to be youthful as any, 

Father Sprague ! 
Make thee seem to be youthful as any. 

HENRY C. WRIGHT. 
My dear Henry C, 
I most fully agree 
Thou art « Wright," at least in the opinion, 
That man over man 
Never rightfully can 
Hold, or delegate power of dominion, 

Henry C. ! 
Hold, or delegate power of dominion. 



[ 25 ] 

GEORGE BOURNE. 
Och, Geordie, my joy ! 
Ye're a broth of a boy, 
And truly the slaveholders' dread ; — 
Faith ! give 'em a look, 
Or shake at them "the Book," 
And sure, aint they nearly half dead, 

Daddy Bourne ! 
And sure, aint they nearly half dead. 

ARTHUR TAPPAN. 

Arthur T., Arthur T., 

But few that we see 
Are as self-sacrificing as thou ; 

Wherever thou art, 

We know that thy heart 
With kindliest feelings will glow, 

Arthur T. ! 
With kindliest feelings will glow. 

AMOS A. PHELPS. 
Amos Phelps, is it true, 
When the Grimkes passed through 
New England, the truth to a// preaching ; 
That thou didst approve 
Their labors of love, 
And bid them " God speed" in their teaching, 

Amos A. ! 
And bid them « God speed" in their teaching 1 



[ 26 ] 

JAMES C. JACKSON. 
Jim Jackson, I trow, 
When thou holdest the plough, 
The furrows are strait and well made ; 
That thou wilt look back, 
Or fly off of the track, 
No one of thy friends is afraid, 

James C. ! 
No one of thy friends is afraid. 

LUTHER LEE. 

Thy figures, friend Lee, 

Are unpleasant to me, — 
Thy " damned ghosts and spectres of hell 

If thy fanciful mind 

Was to earth more confined, 
Methinks it would answer as well, 

Luther Lee ! 
Methinks it would answer as well. 

FRANCIS JACKSON. 

Ah, Francis, hadst thou 

Been contented to bow 
To the Baal, « New Organization," 

The clerical corps 

Would have honored thee more, 
And voted their warm approbation, 
Francis J. ! 
And voted their warm approbation. 



[ 27 ] 

JONATHAN CURTIS. 

Brother Curtis, we're told 

How thy namesake of old, 
For Rome a self-sacrijice made ; — 

And darest thou falter 

Because on Truth's altar 
A time-serving clergy is laid. 

Brother G. ! 
A time-serving clergy is laid ] 

CHAUNCEY L. KNAPP. 

Beware, Chauncey Knapp, 

Of the clerical trap 
That is baited with texts from St. Paul ;- 

Around it don't linger, 

Or else on thy finger 
Perchance it may happen to fall, 

Chauncey L, ! 
Perchance it may happen to fall. 

;daniel wise. 

Thy name, Daniel Wise, 

Thy conduct belies, 
And thou hast most grievously erred : 

Thy pen and thy tongue 

Have been much in the wrong. 
If one-half be true I have heard, 

Daniel Wise ! 
If one-half be true I have heard. 



[ 28 ] 

HIRAM CUMMINGS. 

« Wo is me, Hiram Cummings ! 

" In spite of our drummings 
« For aid, our recruits couldn't save us ; 

" Like a hero of old 

" Of whom we are told, 
" A woman the fatal blow gave us, 

" Wo is me ! 
" A woman the fatal blow gave us." 

GEORGE W. BENSON. 

George Benson, George Benson, 

Tho' waves of dissension 
Around us may gather in might ; 

Like a rock 'mid the storm, 

Thou art steadfast and firm, 
And high burns thy beacon and bright, 

George Benson ! 
And high bums thy beacon and bright. 

MARY MURRAY. 

I fear, Mary Murray, 

Thou art in a hurry, — 
Friends should but in unity move : 

In quietude sit. 

Till the meeting sees fit 
To unite with thy labors of love, 

Mary M. ! 
To unite with thy labors of love. 



[ 29 ] 

WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. 

Though layman and priest, 

From greatest to least, 
Thy character seek to defame ; 

" The slanderer's breath" 

Cannot " darken my faith," 
But brighter for aye grows the flame, 

Garrison ! 
But brighter for aye grows the flame. 

C. F. STOLLMEYER. 

Hail to thee, Stollmeyer 1 

A second Fourier ! 
Thy system is surely a treasure ; 

To Christian or Turk 

It makes all kinds of work. 
By some hocus pocus, a pleasure, 

Stollmeyer ! 
By some hocus pocus, a pleasure. 

JOHN A. COLLINS. 
John Collins, I wonder 
If thou wouldst " knock under," 
If Satan himself should appear : 
I doubt if his bluster 
Thy temper could fluster. 
Or make thee to feel any fear, 

John Collins ! 
Or make thee to feel any fear. 



[ 30 ] 

DAVID LEE CHILD, 

Brother Child, Brother Child, 

Keep thou undefiled, — 
Vote not for pro-slavery men ; 

Tho' Harrison still 

Drives his " Hard Cider" mill, 
And Van Buren's elected again, 

David Lee ! 
And Van Buren's elected again. 

ELLIS GRAY LORING. 

Thy eloquence, Loring, 

Seeks not to be soaring 
On pinions of « mystical lore ;" 

In thy disciplined mind 

There is logic, combined 
With judgment, clear sighted and sure, 

Ellis Gray ! 
With judgment, clear sighted and sure. 

EDMUND QUINGY. 

Edmund Quincy, thy name 

Is encircled with fame, 

More resplendent than warrior-glory ; 

And round it for aye 

Shall a bright halo play 
On the pages of Truth's thrilling story. 

Friend Quincy ! 
On the pages of Truth's thrilling story. 



[ 31 ] 

JAMES S. GIBBONS. 
When others had strayed, 
And their trust had betrayed, 
Thy « Protest" sprang forth into light ; 
And tried hearts and true 
Quickly rallied thereto, 
For justice, for truth, and for right, 

Jim Gibbons ! 
For justice, for truth, and for right. 

ICHABOD CODDING. 

Brother Codding, I fear 

Thou art " out of thy sphere" 
Far more than « Miss Kelly of Lynn," 

When attempting to bind 

The God-given mind, 
And denouncing free action as sin, 

Ichabod ! 
And denouncing free action as sin. 

ELIZUR WRIGHT, JR. 
" 'Tis enough, I declare, i/' 

'< To make any one swear, — 
« That vexed ' Woman Question,' — confound it ; 
« Now Stanton, my hearty, 
« Get up a third party, 
« Or else we can never get round it : 

" Yours, E. Wright ! 
« Or else we can never get round it." 



[ 32 ] 

A. E. AND S. M. GRIMKE.* 

The Grimkcs I sought, 

But, alas ! they were not : 
Has the light from their spirits departed 1 

Rise, gird ye anew 

To dare, suffer, and do ! 
Waver not ! but be firm and true-hearted, 

Once again ! 
Waver not ! but be firm and true-hearted. 



* Aiigelina is inarriecl ; but they are still known and 
spoken of as " the Grimkcs.''
