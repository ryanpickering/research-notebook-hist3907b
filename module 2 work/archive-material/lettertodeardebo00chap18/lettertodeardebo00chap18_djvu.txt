TO THE ABOLITIONISTS OF MASSACHUSETTS. 



Bkethhen : 

The Quarterly meeting of the Massachusetts Anti- 
Slavery Society will be holdea at Boston, on TUES- 
DAY, the 26th day of March, instant. The Board of 
Blanagers call earnestly on all county and town so- 
cieties to send delegates to this meeting. The impor- 
tant questions to come before it make a full represen- 
tation of the whole Slate necessary. The position as- 
sumed by the American Anti-Slavery Society w rela- 
tion to our own, demands an instant and clear expres- 
sion of the opinion of the Commonwealth. 

The Executive Committee at New York, against 
our repealed advice and earnest protest, have virtually 
assumed the management of financial affairs wiihiu 
the State. This power necessarily includes the ap- 
pointment of agents and the control of publications. 
It is ill fact the exclusive control of the cause. The 
question, then, which Massachusetts is ca!led lo an- 
swer, is briefly this, — shall we entru.st the whole gui- 
dance of our enterprise to a dozen individuals? Mo- 
nopoly of power is always dangerous, iii this cause 
peculiarly so, arrayed ns we are against all cla.sses 
and interests, and where a single misstep entails such 
disaslrous consequences. 

Hitherto, if Ohio had gone wrong, her sister States 
Wf're at hand, holding up the standard and keeping the 
beacon-fire bright ami unchanging, to win her back 
to duty and union. If Massachusetts, blinded or de- 
ceived, had faltered, the weakness or indecision would 
have spiead only over a single Slate. But let the 



Slate societies be suspended, — entrust exclusive pow- 
er to a committee at New York — and one mistake is 
ruin — and not to one Stale only, but the whole cause. 
Let the trumpet there once give an uncertain sound, 
let one heart waver, the whole host is broken up — the 
march of the whole arrested. With no distrust of the 
individuals composing the committee, it is the system 
we deprecate. 

We are unwilling to believe that the men and wo- 
men of ihe Commonwealth are ready thus to peril our 
holy enterprize. We have protested in your name 
against the course of the Parenl Society; but in a crisis 
so peculiar, the free voice of IMassachusetts — the 
whole Slate — must support that protest, or it avail* 
nothing. 

If we are wrong— if you are ready lo surrender the 
responsibiliiy and place yourselves and the slave in 
the hands of a few individuals — then it becomes us 
to ask, of what use is the cumbrous machinery of a 
stale organization, and mhelher it would not be better 
to dissolve the Massachuselts Society aiki-iet those 
who assume the whole power bear also the burden 
and responsibility of the cause ? 

Tlie decision of this question is doubly important 
770W in consequence of the approaching anniversary 
of ihe Am. Soeieiy for the instruction of which the 
voice of Massachusetts should be distinctly heard. 

FRANCIS JACKSON, President.
