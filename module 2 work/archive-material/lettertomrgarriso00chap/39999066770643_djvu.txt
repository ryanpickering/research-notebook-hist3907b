DISUNION PLEDGE. 



Whereas, in the formation and adoption of the Consti- 
tution of the United States, the following criminal and 
dangerous concessions were made to the slaveholding 
power, namely: that the foreign slave trade should be 
safely prosecuted under the national flag, as a lawful branch 
of American commerce, for a period of not less than twenty 
years; that fugitive slaves should find no protection from 
their pursuers on any portion of the American soil; that 
slave insurrections should be suppressed by the combined 
military and naval power of the country, if needed in any 
emergency; and that a slaveholding oligarchy, created by 
allowing three-fifths of the whole slave population to be 
represented as property by their masters, should be allow- 
ed a place in Congress; — 

Therefore, regarding that Constitution as a " covenant 
with death, and an agreement with hell, 55 the mighty prop 
that sustains the entire slave system, we, the undersigned, 

to signify our abhorrence of injustice and oppression, and 
to clear our skirts from innocent blood, do hereby pledge 
ourselves not to elect, or in any way aid or countenance 
the election of a candidate for, any office, the entrance 
upon which requires an oath or affirmation to support the 
Constitution of the United States ; but in all suitable ways 
to strive for the peaceable dissolution of the Union, as the 
most consistent, feasible, and efficient means of abolishing 
Slavery.
