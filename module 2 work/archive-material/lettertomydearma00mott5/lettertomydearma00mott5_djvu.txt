CIRCULAR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION OF AMERICAN WOMEN. 

This Circular is addressed to all who sincerely desire the slave's emancipation. Its subject is not new; it has been 
presented to you again and again, until, perhaps, some of you are as weary of it as of a" twice told tale," and will cast 
this paper aside as soon as you have ascertained its character. But we entreat you to read it; not because its subject 
is presented in a new, or peculiarly interesting manner, but to give us an opportunity to stir up your minds to the re- 
membrance of the slave's wrongs and your duties. We are aware that many of you have, for several successive years, 
annually devoted yourselves to the work of procuring signatures to memorials to Congress, praying for the abolition 
of slavery, and that you have willingly and cheerfully expended your time and strength, "in season and out of sea- 
son," for this purpose, and not having witnessed results proportionate to such efforts, it is possible that some are 
almost discouraged, and ready to say, " We have labored in vain, we have spent our strength for naught." Our design in 
addressing you is to urge you to repeat, during this year, with increased fidelity and perseverance, this same arduous work. 

There are a variety of memorials which you have probably been accustomed to circulate, addressed to Congress, or 
your State Legislatures, praying for the repeal of oppressive laws, the granting of a jury trial to reputed fugitive slaves, 
etc. All these we recommend to your attention, but especially urge the importance of petitions to Congress for the 
abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and in Florida, and of the slave trade between the states. 

Allow us, dear sisters, to remind you of one or two reasons why this duty is peculiarly incumbent upon us. 

It is our only means of direct political action. It is not ours to fill the offices of government, or to assist in the 
election of those who shall fill them. We do not enact or enforce the laws of the land. The only direct influence 
which we can exert upon our Legislatures, is by protests and petitions. Shall we not, then, be greatly delinquent if we 
neglect these ? 

We shall not be suspected of party motives. However our legislators may regard our requests, whatever insults 
they may heap on our names, they will not, they cannot, for a moment, suppose that we are influenced by any of the 
selfish motives of political partisanship, which they so quickly detect in their own sex. They will believe in our 
sincerity, and this belief will be greatly advantageous to the success of our memorials. 

There are other reasons which should induce us not to relax, but to redouble our efforts in this department of our 
labor. Slavery is annually increasing the number of its wretched victims. Thousands, since we last circulated pe- 
titions, have commenced their dreary life of bitter bondage. Ought not the increased number of our petitions, this year^j 
to testify . we remember this mournful fact? Our beloved country is annually increasing her guilt and danjjBJf tJiat^ 

Our timv ,'earthly toil, too, is rapidly passing away, and we shall do well to heed the admonition, " Work while tT~ e for 

. day la*=>W v I We know, dear sisters, that this is a weary work. We have deeply felt the difficulties and trials tfy •=," 

"Attend ift. We know how painful it is to endure the scornful gaze, or rude repulses of strangers, as journeying from'* 
house to house to solicit their sympathy for the crushed and heart-broken slave, we see them turn away in hot dis- 
pleasure or cold indifference. At such seasons, let us send our thoughts away to the plantations of the South, where 
they, for whose sake we endure all this, drag out their sad existence. Let us see them in the rice fields, the cotton 
fields, the sugar plantations, bending over their tasks, their bodies lacerated with cruel scourgings, and their hearts 
bleeding in anguish for their loved and lost ones, scattered, they know not whither, and as we contrast the bitterness of 
their sufferings with our toils for their redemption, we shall gather fresh strength and courage. And could we see the 
smile which sometimes lights up the sad features of the slave, when he remembers that he has heard of friends in 
the far North, who are striving to rescue him, and hear the prayer and blessing which go up from his bursting heart, 
for us, how would it inspire our souls with new vigor and devotedness to our work! Let such visions cheer us on- 
ward, and let us, above all, go forth to the work panoplied with prayer. 

In conclusion, we have a few words to say to those who are very willing to sign an anti-slavery petition, yet excuse 
themselves from the labor of circulating it. You acknowledge that it is our duty to send such petitions to Con- 
gress, and, consequently, that it is the duty of some of us to procure signatures to them. You would not consent 
that this work should be suspended, even for one year. Yet if all were to follow your example, it would inevitably 
cease. The duty which we urge does not, of course, devolve upon every one of you. Each must decide for her- 
self the question of personal obligation in the matter. It may be that from the heavy pressure of domestic duties, or 
from other causes, you are not able to spend even an occasional hour in pleading the cause of the slave among your friends 
and neighbors. We would only suggest that before making such a decision, you will, as nearly as possible, place your 
soul " in his soul's stead." Let the mother gather her children about her, and see them seized, sold, and driven 
away to southern markets and plantations, there to spend their lives in mental and moral degradation, that they may 
minister to the avarice and ambition of taskmasters, whose " tender mercies are cruel!" Let the daughter and the 
sister imagine to themselves a home made desolate by slavery's polluting touch, — let us all endeavor, for a few 
hours at least, to " remember those in bonds as bound with them," and then answer the question, Shall I circulate an 
anti-slavery petition?
