Next Tuesday^ ajter the moTV.ing session oj the 
N, Eo Convention, there is to he a meeting of a Jew moments 



t-^ 



A ', 



0/ our Bi i^;^ /4, 5. 5. /9«^, /or the purpose of raising money to 
start ^he National A. S. firgan at //. York. 1/ all the members 



a 



re present, or a goodly number oj thepi, (especial I y those 



wh 



can subscribe say 01S, or so,) it will greatly help the 



general ity of them to contribute from Zto 5. If we, being ISO, 
in number can raise on an. average «?5. each, it will he <^7dO, 
But fifty at least of our nu>n7)er are unable to pay anything. 
So vje can stretch but to 'fSOO, I have been talking vjith Mrs. 
Sout/iwick, Mary Chapman and such others as I have seen, and 
ihey agree with me in thinking that such a lift novK will he 
better than a somevJhat larger sum hereafter. These sort of 
fountains get choked up if they are not kept in continual flow. 
And vje shall not have mueh less c- 1 the fair, for raising -^'oOO 
now. I have put aside a small sum (t5.) for a capital to 
trade upon for the fair, but I fee! as if it -would be better ^ 
to give it outright novj^ "Hovj does it feel to thee"? as the 
Grimke^s (peace to their memories) used to say. Do be vJith ws 
at thit\ time. I remember how much you helped one of these 
raisings at " U6^ long ago^ Ann Chapman was there then. It 'was 
^Before these loaves of bitterness that novj so loudly roar 
Till heayfm^ grov/s the pilot's heart to view the rocky shor^ 
However I do believe lue have taken a gale off shatitre

^hich quality, next to clearness and comprehensiveness is, I 

suppose, found most valuable^) 

Do he at the meeting. It vjill prohahly he hut half an 

hour or so, jrom IZ or halj past, to 1 or half past. And, then 

^e can hope you will dine vji th us, I should not dare to ask

vey to your mind thejidea that she is very ill?~Jatally so?

We are not necessarily made miserahle hii the 2oss oj Jriends- 
lo think so iuere an impeachment oj the divine goodness. But 
^hose to whom bereavement co?nes least painjtil ly cannot but 
intensely reel . though they may not intensely stirrer , 

"Still they knovj, v/kerH^e* er they go^ 
That there hath passed a glory from the earth." 

The hri ghtness of their lije has passed^ and they ac^ 
Quiesce in it, concentrat ing themselves upon its duties. 

I am interrupted hy an opportunity to send, you this, and 
Jortunately at the same tim^ conies Caroline with II. M.'s letter 

Yours affectionately in great haste, 
Maria W. Ch^pinan.
