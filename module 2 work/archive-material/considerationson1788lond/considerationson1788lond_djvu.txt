CONSIDERATIONS 



ON THE 



CONTINUANCE of SLAVERY. 



THE fubjed of Slavery having etigage^ a confider- 
able degree of public attention, and it appearing 
to be a general opinion, that any national determination 
that can be expeded to take place, will be in favour of 
the continuance of Slavery in the Colonies of this 
kingdom, if not of the trade to the coaft of Africa for 
the purpofe of procuring a future fupply of Slaves, it 
becomes a matter of ferious inquiry, as to what will 
be the fituation, in which the whole community of this 
country will place itfelf, by fuch a determination. 

That all the nations into which the world is divided, 
are under the government of infinite Wifdoni and 
Jurtice, and that there are fixed laws eftabliflied by the 
Almighty, as the rules by which mankind fhall con- 
du(5l themfelves in their public meafures as nations, is 
as evident as any thing can be made by all the conclu- 

fion:« 



( 2 ) 

•fions of reafon, and the exprefs declarations of revela- 
tion J and to thefe laws it is, that wc are bound to refort, 
both as men poffefled of reafon aqd as a nation acknow- 
ledging the authority of revelation ; and it rauft be by 
comparing this part of our national condud with thefe 
fettled rules, that we are to form our judgments of the 
reality of our fituation, as a people under that ueiverfal 
government; the laws and adminiftraiions of which we 
allow^ and which cannot be done away by being difbe- 
lieved or difobeyed ; any more than that the laws and 
government of a country, are deftroyeci by any number 
of the fubjeds choofing to acl as if there were none. 

Whatever may be the fituation of the people of 
Africa among themfelves, their being fent away from 
their native country and kindred attachments into fo- 
reign Slavery, is as much the object of their averfion 
as it would be of ours to receive the fame treatment at 
their hands; and any laws we can make for regulating 
the trade and treatment of Slaves, cannot be expeded 
to produce any other change in their minds, than would 
be made in our own by any regulations which, under 
a reverfe of circumftances, might be made as to the 
manner in which we Hiould be treated on our being 
delivered into their hands; and their averfion to foreign 
Slavery, continuing to be the fame after any new re- 
gulations of ours may be made, they will of courfe 
continue to ufe, as they have done, their utmcft efforts 
to prevent themfelves from being taken and fent duwn 
to their fea coaO; and dehvered into our hands. So that 
the elfeds which have followed our trade from its com- 
pienceaient, cam only be expeded to be produced for 

the 



( 3 ) 

the future. The inducements ofFered on our part as 
the price of Slaves, leading thofe of the natives to 
Avhom.thofe offers are made, to ufe their endeavours to 
procure us a fupply of Slaves, by all the means in their 
power ; the various attempts of violence and drfign, 
by one party againft another, will continue without any 
chaiiCTe, and call for the fame refiilance, which has ever 
been made, againft an evil which they fo univerfally 
dread; and thefe attempts on one hand, and the efforts 
made to refift and overcome chem on the other, will 
occafion the continuance of thole fatal contefts, which 
keep the flames of civil war continually burning among 
them- with all the fears and complicated miferies which 
infepjrably attend upon civil wars in any country ; and. 
of which we may form the trued judgment, by con- 
fidering what would be the confequences among our- 
felves, were we at this moment engaged in the fame 
manner, in procuring the people of neighbouring towns 
and adjoining counties, for the purpofe of felhng them 
into foreign Slavery ; and that /hips were continually 
coming upon every part of our coafl:;, and by the in- 
fluence of the inducements they offered as the price of 
the men, women, and children of this country, the whole 
inhabitants were always kept in a ftate of hoftility among 
themfelves; and that from one end of the kingdom to 
the other, there was no place of fafety, nor a perfon in 
it enabled to fay for a day, that in the next he fliould 
not be the prifoner of an oppofite party, and be fent 
from market to market, and paffed fr^mi one trader to 
another, till he was finally fold to the common pur- 
chafers, to be taken to a diflancpart of the world into a 
ftat.e of blavery for life. 

A 2 Thg 



( 4 ) 

The continuance of our Slave trade, continuing to 
meet with this certain, and deep-rooted averfion in the 
minds of the people we procure for our Slaves, all the 
evils which are produced among the inhabitants in the 
country of Africa, will with equal certainty be followed, 
with all the fuiferings which attend the conveyance of 
the Slaves, who are thus procured, to our colonies. Not 
one of them, but being delivered to us as much againft 
their inclinations, as it would be againft our own, to be 
tranfported in the fame manner and for the fame pur- 
pofe, by any other people that had obtained the fame 
power over us, their fufferings on board of Ihip mud 
include the united miferies of the mind, from their beintg 
forced from their relations and friends, with thofe 
which arifc from their being expofed to any treatment 
that may be offered to them without diftindion of age 
or fex, and the unavoidable wretchednefs of a fitoatiora 
like that of being fhut up in clofe confinement, the wit- 
neifes of each others forrows and fufferings. And to 
ihefe evils to the country and people we procure, is to 
be added the injuries infeparable to a ftate of Slavery, 
From the day they are expofed ta fale in owr colonies^ 
purchafed and driven they know not whe?e, to be the 
property of they know not whom, they are as much at 
the difcretion of their owners, as in this country our 
cattle are, as to the treatment they fhall receive at our 
hands or from thofe to whom they areentrufted. And 
though we are under all the inducements of felf-intereft 
to treat them well, yetnotwithftanding this, how they 
are treated in numberlefs inllances^ may be known by 
the ipanner in which fuch vaft number of horfes are de- 
ftr'oyed and wrought to death, by negled and feverity; 



{ 5 ) 

and dilnking, as we ought, needier of human nature in 
the coloniei than at home, we cannot be at a lofs to 
conceive what muft be the treatment Slaves will in ge- 
neral receive, left as they are to feel all the efFeds 
of avarice unreftrained in limiting the extent of their 
labours, and of anger in punifhing them at pleafurei, 
without fear or controul ; befide?. all the fufFt rings which 
human beings cannot fail to feel at being bought and 
fold, hired out and fent away, without any regard to the 
relations in which tliey ftand to thofe they are made 
to leave behind them. 

To continue the Slave Trade at all, and to tolerate 
Slavery under any regulations, and to prevent thofe 
injuries to the country and people of Africa, feems no 
more to be done than to feparate the confequence from 
the caufe by which it is produced. If the inhabitants of 
that vaft continent could know of any regulations, by 
which we might intend to provide for the better treat- 
ment of Slaves, it would not take away their averfion 
to being fent into foreign Slavery on any terms, that 
being an averfion infeparable to human nature ; and 
our regulations producing no change in their minds, 
they will continue to defend themfelves to the laft ex- 
tremity ; and were we as a nation, to refolve on a per- 
petual war with the whole continent of Africa, the 
worfl: effefts which could be expeded from it, would 
not be equal to thofe which are produced by the ia- 
fluence of our Trade. And however we may regulate 
this Trade, from the moment any part of thofe people 
become our Slaves, they are in our hands as prifoners 
without crimes, receiving puniftiment without any ap- 

A 3 peal 



( 6 ) 

peal to juflice, fuffering without hope of relief, and left to 
the lawlefs power of every individual whofe property 
they gre. 

How far a condu6l like this in the people of one 
country to thqfe of another, offends againft the laws 
which it is reafonable to believe mankind are under, ap- 
peal s from the firft reflexion that the feveral countries 
in the World are equally calculated for the happinefs 
of the inhabitants 5 and of courfe for one part of raaa- 
kind to break in upon the country of another, occaficn 
continual wars for the purpofe of taking as many of 
them as can be obtained for Slaves, and then keeping 
them as fuch to the end of their lives, would appear to. 
include every crime, which the people of one country 
can be guilty of againft thofe of another, and offend as 
highly as it is pofTible to offend againft every principle 
and all the reafbns of natural juftice; and as far as hu» 
man meafures can do it, diredly oppofe all the purpofes- 
cf infinite goodnefs in the provifion made for the happi» 
nefs of mankind ; and that for a nation fo to offend, muH 
be to expofe itfelf to the penalties necefTarily annexed, 
as the natural confrquences of a condudl oppofed to 
the will of the Creator, and to the peace of the World, 
and without which penalties there would be no pro- 
vilionmade, nor be any fuch thing as univerfai juftice 
among mankind ; and if thofe punifhments were any 
thing Ihort of a full return of fufferings to thofe which 
they themfelves inflided, juftice would be defeftive and 
the guilty be left finally to gain by their crimes j and 
if fuch a return of lufl^erings was not to be inflided upon 
the people who offended and would continue to do fa, 

it 



( 7 ) 

it would befuch a defed of juftice in the government of 
the World, as would place the fupreme difpoler of all 
events in the view of mankind, as being equally regard- 
lefs of the crimes of the guilty as of the fufferings of the 
opprefled ; and this would be the fame as to conclude 
that the Almighty neither regarded juftice nor mercy 
among mankind. But as much reafon as there is to be 
aflured of the contrary, all that reafon have we to con- 
clude that juftice will be done to the guilty, that mercy 
will be ihewn to the opprefled ; and nations only exifting 
in the prefent (late of things, in that ftate they muft 
receive an equal and certain return of their joint mea» 
fures as communities in the treatment of othe^-s ; and 
continuing theii- injuries, they have all the certainty of 
receiving the returns of them, which can arife from a 
confideraiion of the juRice and goodnefs of Goo, 

But to turn from the conclufions of reafon, to the 
clear light of revelation, the certainty and nature of the 
Divine Government is made as plainly to appear, as 
words can convey a fenfe of things to the human mind: — 

" The dom:mon of the Most High is an everlafting 
dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to ge- 
neration; be doeth according to his luill, among the 
inhabitants of the earth; {ind none can Jiay his hnnd, 
— T])£re is one Lavj-giver, vjho is able to fave and 
to dejlroy. — The Lord is our fudge, the Lord is our 
LaiU'giver, the Lord is our KingJ*^* 

What the univerfal law is, by which nations, as well 
as individunls, are obliged to govern their condud to 
each other, fufficiently appears from its being com- 
manded 
* Daniel 4. Ifaiah 33. James 4. 



( 8 ) 

ittanded, tliat — <' All things 'whatfoever you 'would 
that men Jhould do to youy do you even jo to them,* 

The penalty annexed to the breach of this law, is, 
that they who offend againft it, fhall themfelves be 
treated as they have treated others. — •' He' that leadeth 
into captivity fhall go into captivity .• As they have 
caufed to be /lain, fo fhall they be Jlain. For the Lord 
God of rscompenfe Jhall purely requite "f 

The examples under the adminiOration of thefe laws, 
by the providence of the Almj&htv^ appears in many 
inO^ancesj in the cafe of one of the empires ot the Eafl: 
it is laid — '' They have ufed oppreffion and exercifed 
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy, yea they 
have oppreffed the Jiranger ivrengjully .-^Therefore 
have I poured out mine indignation upon them, I have 
confnmed ihem with the fire of my ivrath. And as a 
reafon for tliis judgment it is faid— " 'They, the people 
who were ill-treated, were opprejfed together, and all 
that toek them captives held them fafl, they re f ufed 
to let t.^em go.^^% 

By this it appears, that the nation who had made an 
Mnjuft and cruel qfe of its power, had been applied to 
in behalf of the people they opprefled, and that it was 
uot till after they had rejufed to let them go, that they 
■were made to receive the recompsnce ot their conduct, 
under the irrefiltible adminiftration of univerfal juftice; 
the notion of which power is given us by its being faid— • 

" Their 

* Matth, 7, t Revelatson 13. Jer. 3I9 % Jer. su 



( 9 ) 

<' Their Redeemer is ftrongy the Lord of Hojls is his 
name, he JI}all thoroughly plead their caufeJ^^ 

And to prevent the miftake ©f pleading the divine 
attribute oi mercy ^ againfl: the expedation of jutlice, 
the Almighty hath faid — " Mine eye Jhall not J pare ^ 
neither will I have pity, but I will recompenfe their 
ivay upoiz their head — / will render to all the inhzbi' 
t ants all their evil. Ir And to Ihew that the ^oo^K(?/> 
of God, calls upon us to look for the execuri,>n of his 
juftice, when appeals are made in vain for the i eiief of 
the opprefFed, it is faid — ** He Jhall deliver the needy 
when he crieth ; the poor alfo, and him that hath no 
helper ; he jlyall redeem them from deceit and vio»' 
lence, and precious Jlyall he their bloodinhis Jight-.^'* 

But degraded as the people of A,frica are, in the diffant 
dominions of this kingdom, to an equality with meer 
animals, it is poffible that we may exclude them, in uur 
view, from the moO^ dirtant expedation of the divine 
compalTion being fhewn in their fav^iur, in any fuchreal 
fenfe as thefe words cunvey — He floall redeem them 
from deceit andviolence -and that the Almighty doth 
not look down upon the blood oi all that are flain iu the 
wars to procure them, and that perilh under the fufFerings 
they receive by our means and at our hands, a' he 
would upon ourfelves. But to exclude them from the 
fulieft fhare in the compaffion of our common Creator, 
would be to forget that we are all partakers of the lame 
common nature; that we all itand in the fame relation 
to himfelf, that his goodwill is as much expreilf -d m 
their perfons, climate and country as our own; and at 

thus 

* Jer. JO. t Ezek. 9, 



( !0 ) 

tlius to exclude tbem in our efleem from an equal /Ijare 
in all the deligns of his mercy, would be to think with 
the moll miiiaken Jtws, v/ho would not admit that the 
refi: of mankind were^ with thenifelve^;, intended to re- 
ceive all the offered goodnefs of God^ through the 
MeliJah and Saviour of the World, contrary to all the 
evidence of the univerfalicy of his mercy and goodwill, 
upon the face of the creation, and in the entire fcope and 
jQumberiefsexprefs declarations of fcripture — That God 
is no reipedlor of perfons; that his mercy is over all his 
works; that he defpifeth none; that he is loving to 
every man; and that in judging he regardeth not the 
rich, nor prefers them and their caufe to the perfons and 
sntercfts of the poor, — declarations which are proved 
by all the fads which are recorded i;) the fcriptures, of 
Ills divine notice of the pooreft ; among whom he ap- 
peared himfelf as our Redeemer, in a itate of the loweft 
bumiliation, and to encourage our comrcon humanity, to 
look for refuge in his favour, choofmg for his fervants 
and friends the poor and defpifed, making them the 
xvitnelTes of all that power, wifdonj and goodnefs of God, 
which are difplayed in the hiftory of his life in the New 
Teftament, received and eitabiifiied in this and every 
other Chriftian country, contradi6ling every thought of 
fuch a fuppoiltion, as that the people of Africa are not 
as much the objeds of his divine compaflion, as the inha- 
bitants of this or any other country in the world would 
be, who were fuft'ering under the fame calamities as 
■we are now fo iBuch the occafion of infliding upi;n rhcm ; 
it -i.ot being the merits of mankind but their miferies 
■which caii for the interpofition of infinite goodnefE; and 
a& a part oi iiiankind fuifering at tiie hands o^ others, 

all 



( II ) 

sll that hath ever been promifed and done for any peo- 
ple under the fame circumitances, we have the fame 
caufe to expedl to be done for them, infinite goodnefsand 
human mifery being the fame now they ever were.. 
None were ever more defpifed or cppreflcd than the 
people of the Jc-'ws were in Egypt, and though tliat 
opprellion was allowed to continue long and to be ex- 
treme in the degree of it, yet they were made an ex- 
ample to mankind, how much God regards the forro^i's 
and fufferings of the afflided. And to fhew how equal 
the divine adminillrations are, many inltancei are given 
us, in the cafe of the Jewifli nation, when they were 
the oppreflbrs; and among thefe that may be named, of 
their being vifited with a famine, which continued till 
they did juflice to the pecple they had treated with 
cruelty.* 

And this lafl: inftance is the more neceffary to be con- 
fidered in our own cafe, as it feems calculated to pre« 
vent a miftake, that diftinguifhed mercies> in any nation, 
imply a future impunity for its crimes ; a fuppoiition 
which appears to be as natural, in the feafon of general 
profperity in a country, as felf confidence and a fearlefs 
difregard of offending, is but the too frequent attendant 
upon the profperity of individuals. But dillinguiihed 
as different nations have been by the divine favour, when 
that favour was turned into a forgetfulnefs of God, and 
a difregard of the rights of others ; their hiftory firft 
prefents to our view, the public calls upon them to re- 
form their abufes; but not doing it, flow but irrefiflible 
fufferings feconded the meffages of mercy; and when 
human pride chofe rather to bid defiance to infinite:

juftice, than to make an acknowledgment of public of. 
fences by real reformation, we then fee them fmking 
under the returns of their own condud to others, and 
frequently inflidled upon the greateft and moft pro- 
Iperous nations,by means of the corruptions which were 
the confequences of their crimes ; and the accounts of 
their glory, their guilt and their ruin, appear to tell us 
as certainly as hiftory and matter of faft can tell us, that 
the higheft human powers, and the policy of dates, 
when ergaged in a determmed continuance of crimes, 
pfford no fecui ity againft the returns of juffice. And as 
they to whom much is given, of them the more is re- 
quired, when nations have at once been as eminent for 
the advantages they enjoyed as for the crimes they com- 
mitted, it has neither been the mercies they poflefled, 
nor the numbers among them who feared to offend, 
which faved them from total ruin; their wrongs being 
evident, there punifliment has been made equally public, 
to prevent mankind from being milled by their example. 

To excufe our condud as a nation to the country 
and people of Africa, becaufe they make Slaves of each 
other, is to make the crimes of heathens examples to 
be imitated by a nation poffeffed of the cleareft know- 
ledge of revelation And to fuppofe ourfelves autho- 
rifed in making Slaves of the Africans, becaufe Slavery 
has been common among mankind from very early ages 
of the world, will perhaps be found on better con{idera« 
tion to be the fame miftake in the conduct of a nation, 
as it would be in private life for individuals to look 
upon the punifliments inflided by public juftice, to be 
the example of the treatment which the fubjeds fhould 

ihew 



{ 13 ) 

fliew tQ one another, and whoever had the poM'-er was 
warranted by what was done under the authority of the 
magiftrate, to do the fame thing for any purpofe of his 
avarice or refentment. To fuppofe that the fufferings of 
Slavery,were ever infliftedby the divine authority, butas 
the punifhment of crimes, would be a charge againft infi- 
nite juftice and goodnefs; and whenever Slavery was in- 
flifted as a punifhment, it became neceflai y to provide 
for the treatment of Slaves, which was perhaps nothing 
more than to limit and refirain the fentence ; but to 
conclude from thefe examples that the people of one 
country, were to make them the rule of their treatment 
to the people of another, v/ould be to turn the fentence 
into common pradice, and which would make it as law- 
ful for the people of one nation to put thofe of another 
to death, becaufe many ages ago, fome had forfeited 
their lives as others had the'r liberties by their crimes. 
— What crime have the people of Africa committed, 
and where is our authority to oblige them to receive 
fuch a fad variety of fufferings by our means? None of 
the people of that vaft continent ever came to thefe 
kingdoms to do us any injury; no neceflity of feif de- 
fence can be pretended for our contributing, as much 
as we do, to ruin their country and make Slaves vf its 
inhabitants ; reafon, natural juflice and revelation, 
unitedly prohibit any fuch pradice as making a Trade 
in their Perfons, and forcing them by thoufands to fpend 
their lives in labouring for cur advantage, in any fiiua- 
tion, much more in one where they are expofed to the 
worft treatment; fufFering the lofs of liberty and every 
right of rational beings, of all power over themfelvea 
Qf their offspring; and enduring by foirce well nigh 

every 



every poflible injury which can render human life com-' 
pletely and conltantly mii'erable, and a& far as can be 
done, under the continuance of their exigence, deftroy- 
ingasinuchashuman treatment can deftroy,allthedefign3 
for which life and being were given for tbei? happinefs as 
much as for our own. And thus fuffering at our hands, 
are ->ve not to confider it as applicable to ihem, that, — ■ 
Their Redeemer is firong — he "will thoroughly plead 
their caufe ; and that ail the goodnefs of God is 
pledgedfor their relief; and that the continuance of the 
injuries we have done them, equally call for the inter- 
pofition of his juftice; and which in the turn of a few 
years to come, may make the deliberationsof our whole 
nation on their fufFerings and our treatment of them, 
as perfectly infignificant, as within the few years that 
are paft, they have been made to multitudes of the fame 
people who were^under our authority, placed in the fame 
fituation; but to whom deliverance has come by other 
means— '*^ The laft war having; amidfl a multitude of 
evils, fuch as 'v:iar necefla'ily produces, been attended 
with one accidental effect, which, whatever may bfe 
thought of it in a commercial view, I do not fcruple in 
a religious one, to call a blelfing; It has very greatly 
impededand diminifhed that opprobrious traffic in which 
this country has for a long time taken the lead, the 
Slave Trade on the Coafl of Africa..''^^ And which 
war hasbeen followed, by the reftoration of the rights of 
hunjanity to thoufands of Africans in America, by placing 
them as men with men, at liberty to acquaint themfelves 
with God, to worfhip and obey him ; to difcharge every 
relative obligation ; to labour for themfelves and to

r€ap the rewards of their own induftry^ and In the pub- 
lic peace and common good to find tlieir own— A 
chino-e of fituatioii from evil to good, from fo much 
inifery to fo much happinefb, produced under events 
and circumflances fo perfeflly beyond all human deligns, 
as feems not only to make it warrantable, but to re- 
quire it as a duty to afcribe it to God, and number it 
among thf great inllances of his goodnei's, in delivering 
the needy when he crieth; the poor alfo and him that 
hath no helper ; redeeming them equally fro^n all the- 
effecls ff the deceit and violence of thofe who led theiu 
away captive and would detain them in that fituation. 

And as a further reafon for confidering the releafe 
from Slavery of fo many Africans in America, as an ati 
of the divine adminiflraticn, to trace this deliverance to 
its firfi; commencement, it is found to ha: e proceeded 
from the pureft principle of a few, who pi ofefs to wor- 
fliip God as a Spirit, no lefs than as their Creatofl 
and Redf.emer, attributing to hisilicred influence upon 
the human mind, every good thought, and the inclina- 
tion and capacity to perform every good work : Thus 
believing themfelves taught and directed, and with great 
cauiion and diffidence, under the 'ipprelTion of forrow 
for the afSided and of fear-to offend, afmall number of 
pel fons among the pe?ple called ^takers in America, 
became firfl the private and afterwards more publicly 
the advocates cf the people (.f Africa, faying n;; other 
than that which the Almighty fo many ages ago required 
in behalf of anwtheropprelTrd people — That they ihould 
let them go ; for their difobedience to svhici' they were 
not .only. punilhed but a$ a nation totally deftroycd. 

But

But this requefl: of liberty to the Africans meeting witii 
ferioiK^ confideration it was regarded and obeyed, and 
under ma«y difficulties, and at much expence to the 
body of people who were firft called upon to change 
the condition of their Slaves into that of freemen and 
fellow fubjeds, they foon generally^ and now without a 
fingle exception, have allowed the plain diredions of 
revelation and the didates of reafon and juftice to take 
place, and out weigh all the confiderations of intereft ; 
and in their obedience they have already found iheir 
reward ; they have reaped the fruits of peace on reflec- 
tion, many have approved and followed their example, 
and this has extendeditfelf to public authority j tothefe 
returns are to be added the grateful attachments of the 
poor people, to whom they reftored the rights of reli« 
gion and juftice v/hich had been fo long with-held ; and 
the vigour and animation of their induftry as freemen 
and hired fervants, has given them and the world a new 
proof, in the greater advantages arifing from their la- 
bours, that obedience to the laws of God includes its 
own reward, and, as the higheft inducement for every 
poffible ad of goodwill from men to men, that in this 
life, the bounty of the Moft High, is infeparably an- 
nexed to the duty and obedience of public bodies of 
mankind, to his divine command, to do as we would be 
done by.* And when the reafons, for believing that

raifed 



( '7 ) 

the difcharge of the Africans from Slavery and the 
difcontinuance of the Trade, were agreeable to the 
declared will of God, againft either forcing into Slavery, 
or refufing to let thofe go who are already in that iitua- 
tion, the continuance of our national condud in obtain- 
ing and ufing Slaves, would appear to give us the fame 
caufe to exped the penalties annexed to the breach of 
the laws of GoD, and an oppofition to the nature and 
defigns of his government, as they have to exped punifh- 
menr, who will continue to offend againft the laws of 
any government. 

Our Trade and treatment of the people of Africa, 
have continued during a great part of the lafl: and from 
the beginning of the prefent century ; and for more 
than twenty years, we have been publicly and continu- 
ally called upon to compare this part of our national 
conduct, with the principles of natural juliice and the 
exprefs laws of God ; all the arguments of religion, 
reafon, and humanity have been ufedbymen of feriouf- 

nefs, 

raifed by the labour of Slaves ; as he had from his firft engaging 
in their caufe, carefully avoided whatever he knew or believed 
had come through their hands, vpho were unjuftly compelled to 
labour without any requital, which in his view made every grain 
that grew on the ground cultivated by their labours, to pafs through 
a medium of injuftice and oppreffion. His writings, publiflied 
under the title of his Journal, feem to give the cleareft view of the 
firft rife of the defign of obtaining the abolition of Slavery, at the 
fame time that they prefent to our view a man feeling for the mi. 
fcries of men, and giving himfelf up as the fervant of every mea- 
fure which in his efteem tended to their relief; and the fuccefs of

means of infliding, upon the inhabitants of a fourth part 
of the world, have been made to pafs in review before 
us ; from the firfl: inducements offered by our Trade, 
to thefe natives of Africa who live by the opprefiion of 
the reft, to the expiring moans of unpitied Slaves dying 
in our colonies, under the feverity of their toil and the 
cruelty of their treatment ; by the teftimony of men 
mod worthy to be believed, we have feen and heard 
the whole of our condad and of its efFeds ; and one 
great appeal hath been made to us as from heaven, itfelf, 
by the fervants of God and Religion, to do them juftice, 
to ftop our Trade and fet them free ; to be confiftent 
with ourfelves, and as a nation, receiving and eftablifti- 
ing by the whole fyftem of our government the revealed 
will of God, to obey the laws which we allow to be of 
divine obligation, and by difcontinuing the offences 
againft them, which our fore fathers in this inftance firft 
began to commit^ avoid the penalties the Almighty 
hath declared and we acknowledge to be annexed to

for that of the fubjeds concerned in the Trade and pro- 
perty of the Slaves, what are we to look for but that 
this " Commerce perfifted in, may draw down the ven- 
geance of an offended God to vifit, not only Great Bri- 
tain, but all Europe^ with every calamity which they

mit the captivity of hisoffspring."* It may do it in our 
own time, to prevent the influence of our example upon 
thofe who (hall live after us in this ifland, and to pre- 
vent thofe fufFerings of our fellow creatures, and to vin- 
dicate the honour of the laws of God and of his govern- 
ment which we will not allow to be of equal confidera- 
tion with our apparent interefts. Or, the long-fuffcring 
of the Almighty may fufpend hisjuftice, and the fame 
trial of obedience be offered to the next or a more diftant 
age But the crime continued in, muft call for the pu- 
nifhment as certainly as that God is juft and his mercy 
over all his works. 

That the punifhment, as it is declared in the New- 
Teftament, is ^s juji in its nature, as it is reafonable to 
cxpe<5l it to be certain in its execution, they who offend 
being left to proportion their own puniflnuent, by the 
injuries they choofe to commit. But being no greater 
how dreadfully fevere will it be, to receive no other than 
the returns of our own conduft, and be punifhed hy 
the fame avarice which now inclines us to make and 
keep the people of Africa as our Slaves, and by being 
given up as a nation, to the evil we would continue to 
commit, be as much inclined to make Slaves of each 
other, as now we are of the Africans; to have the peo- 
ple (if one party fet upon thofe of another, with the ' 
fame defigns which we now by our Trade and ufe of 
Slaves encourage and reward among the inhabitants of 

Africa

Africa. To have our towns and cities burning for the 
fame purpofes as they are now fet on fire by our means 
in the country we fo cruelly invade, by the divifions 
and wars produced among the people we induce to take 
each other for our Slaves. To fee or to be among the 
number of our fellow citizens and countrymen, feized, 
fold and delivered on board of Ihip and conveyed away 
to live and die the Slaves of the people of any diftant 
nation whom we only know by their name, and which 
we have been taught to dread next to the name of death 
itfelf ; and in their hands to be driven by the la(h of 
unlimitted tyranny to labours above our ftrength, to 
have all our rightt, turned itito fulFerings without remedy • 
and to have our oppreffion, affliftion and forrows, 
deemed neceffary to bring us low and keep us fo, to 
prevent our entertaining the leaft hope or profpedlof a 
iuccefsful reliltance of the wrongs we receive. 

From a profpe^l like this, it is as natural for the hu- 
snan mind to turn away, as it is for us to avoid what- 
ever offends the mind, or gives us perfonal pain, and 
every fentiment of felf-love flirinks back with indigna- 
tion at any fuch fuppofition as that the treatment we 
have fhewn Ihall ever be returned to ourfelves ; and will 
iiot allow us to think it to be within the poflibility of 
events, that as a nation we (hall ever be treated as we 
have aded, and reap a return of the fulFerings, which, 
againft all that could be faid to the contrary, we would 
continue to infiid. This was the opinion of thofe na- 
tions, who had by their crimes expofed themfelves to 
their meafure of punifhment, on the delivery of thofe 
divine meffages, which are preferved in the fcriptures, 
for mankind to apply to the fame conduft to the end of 

the 



( 21 ) 

the world ; influenced by their apparent interefts, they 
were bent upon the continuance of their crimes, and 
would not allow the profpecl of the punifliment, to pro- 
duce any efteclual change in their meafures ; no more 
than have been produced in this country for two hun- 
dred years pall, by the (landing admonition of all the 
truths of revelation fummed up in fuch ftanding rules, 
as — I ivlll reconipence their ivay up 07i their head. — - 
I ivill render to all the inhabitants all their evil. -^ 
He that leadeth into captivity ^i ail go into captivity, 
PalTages which have received their repeated, awful con- 
firmation, by the variety of cafes recorded in the fcrip- 
tures, of the ruin of thofe cities and nations which were 
too proud to obey Omnipotence itfelf ; and bold and 
felf-confident enough, to avow by their condud, that 
they would rifque the public fafety and profperity, on 
the fuppontion that all they heard of the laws by which 
the Creator of the world governed it by his providence 
was fable and fal/hood ; chargh)g thofe who advanced 
the contrary with prefumption, in fuppofing what the 
Ai-mighty would do, though the certainty of crimes con- 
tinued in fliould be followed by tlieir punifhments, was 
among the plained proofs of experience. And thofe 
charges of prefumption feem to have been the moft 
common courfe which mankind have taken, to reheve 
themfelves of all uneafy apprehenfions, in offending 
againft thofe laws of reafon and natural juflice, which 
are fo plainly declared in Revelation ; and there ap- 
pears to be fome reafon, from the pradice of mankind, 
for faying, That few charges are more likely to be 
taken for granted, than fuch as are brought againfb 
thofe who venture to bring down thebelief of revealed 

truths 



( 22 ) 

truths to the pradllce of common life, and apply them ss 
the rules of judging of right and wrong, and the cleared 
difcoveries of the courfes of fafety and profperity, as 
"well as of thofe which lead to danger and ruin. But 
to fhew on which fide the prefumption lies ; let us 
confider ourfelves to be the eye witiiefles to a conduct 
like that of which fo many were unhappily guilty in the 
capital of this kingdom, within all our memories ; and 
if after we had feen lawlefs numbers fetting fire to the 
houfes of their fellow citizens, who had never offended 
them, they proceeded from one part of the country to 
another, and did the fame mifchief wherever they came; 
it might juftly be deemed prefumption, to fay. That on 
ftich a doy thofe daring violations of the public peace 
ihould receive their puuifhments ; becaufe the time and 
circumftances of punifhing the guilty depended upon the 
pleafure of the Gcvernment itfelf .: But would it be 
•prefumption in a fpeftator of Inch crimes, to fay. What 
were the piinifliments which the laws had annexed to 
the crimes of which he was a witnefs ; or that thofe 
punilhment.s were as certain as that there was a Go- 
vernment poflefled of the power of adminiftering its 
own laws ; and that they who would continue in the 
commilTion of their crimes, could have no hope to ef- 
cape, whatever the lenity of Government might be to 
fuch as ceafed from the wrongs they had done, upon 
the firft notice that convinced them of their delufion* 
Would not the. prefumption be on the fide of thofe, 
who would go on to commit the crimes, and ad as if 
there was no government ? Or, if there was, it either 
had not the ju^nce, or was without the power to punifli 
them; a fuppofition which is not true even among the 

moft 



( ^3 ) 

mofl uncultivated nations of mankind, who are under the 
necelTity for their common fafety, to unite in punilhing 
thofe who invade the rights of their fociecy. And Ihall 
it be fuppofed, that infinite wifdom and goodnefs hath 
provided neither law nor juftice between the nations 
into which the world is divided, but what they can do 
that they may, and enjv^y a fuccefsful impunity to any 
crimes they may judge it to be their intereft to commit? 
Is the material fyrtem of the univeiTe, and the whole 
courfe of nature, under a government of no greater 
exacHinefs, than to warrant us to draw fuch a cunclu. 
fion, as that the whole fociety of mankind are under no 
laws, are as nations, fubjccts of no fupreme univerfal 
government : 1 he material being but for the ufe of 
the rational world, is it not to be inferred, as Revela- 
tion declares it to be, that G'"D is the Law-giver, Go- 
vernor and Judge ; and that he never forfakes the 
world for a moment, but that his goodnefs is ever en- 
gaged to deliver the afflifted from their fufffrings, and 
to fhew the feverity of his juftice, when all the offers 
of his mercy are in vain to the guilty. 

Nothing is more certain than that the Trade in Slaves, 
all the effects produced by it in Africa, and the fuffer- 
ings of Slaves in our Colonies, may not together amount 
to the idea of a crime in the eileem of felf-intereft ; 
and that it may fmcerely be thought that we, who are 
•whites and chriJVians, are not to fuifer any reftraints 
in our commerce, or diminution in our revenues, from 
any motives of tendernefs or juflice to them who are 
blacks and heathens ; but if there was no danner to 
fear any returns of our treatment of them, is it becom- 
ing 



( 24 ) 

ing the dignity of a nation, vvhofe honour it is not to 
allow by its laws a fingle inflance of Slavery, to permit 
its fabjedls to make the buying and felling of Slaves 
their common traffic ; that a nation, whole laws protedl 
every fubje 61 againft the fmalleft inftance of violence, 
ihould allow of a Trade which produces continual wars, 
and fpreads devaftation through a number of nations, 
every one of which is far more numerous than ourown ; 
and that we, who would think it as mean as unjuft, to 
take the labour of the poor, and not pay them their 
wa^es, fliall give our public fandion as a people to the 
compelling fow" hundred thoiifand of the people of 
Africa, to fpend their lives in continual labours within 
the dominions, and not only deny them any requital 
whatever, but deprive them of all the rights which be- 
long to them as men in common with ourfelves. Is it 
the report which we would wilh all fature ages to re- 
ceive of this nation, in the preient, that we gave full 
liberty to render a iourth part of the earth, the refl- 
dence of mifery and wretchednefs in the extreme to its 
inhabitants ; that it was our policy to procure and to 
treat human beings as only made to labour for our in- 
terefts ; and that the ufe we made of our power, was 
to exercife oppreffion over thofe who were incapable 
of reilfting it. That as a nation eftablilhing chriftianity 
by our laws, and continually publiiliing and appealing 
to its facred truths, when fairly applied to, to give 
effeft to its excellent maxims, there was neither difm- 
tereftednefs nor refolution enough to do it; to purchafe 
the whole property of Slaves, at the expence of the 
nation which had allowed their oppreffion, and fei them 
free j to raife them to the condition of fubjects, and 

prohibit 



( 25 ) 

prohibit a Trade and pracftice forbid by GoD, with all 
the plainnefs and f^Tce, with which we can conceive of 
our own relndlance to the fame treatment ; and as much 
oppofed to every principle of juOice and to the wifdom 
and equity of the entire fyftem of our own government, 
as violence and wrong can be to the public peace of 
mankind, and as contrary as the crimes of individuals 
and of whole nations are declared, by the Almighty 
himfelf, to be to their true interefts and happinefs.
