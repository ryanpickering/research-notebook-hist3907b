THE ELEVENTH 

Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Fair. 

This annual effort for the sustentation of the an- 
ti-slavery cause will be made in Amory Hall, Bos- 
ton, commencing on Tuesday, Dec. 24th, 1844. By 
its means it is, that the debts of the cause, last year, 
were discharged ; so that it is, at this moment, free 
to put forth its unencumbered strength, in the pvos- 
ecution of THE HUNDRED CONVENTIONS, 
through the medium of ivhich, this appeal reaches 
you. If you wish slavery to cease, you cannot more 
effectually aid in its extinction, than by upholding 
this Fair. The experience often years enables the 
women of Massachusetts to present it to you as an 
effectual channel, through whicli your sympathy may 
unite with that of others, to swell the flood of effort 
by which high principle shall be diffused and right 
feeling excited, till the horrible institution of slave- 
ry shall be swept away. 

None of the funds raised by means of this Pair 
are ever permitted to run to waste in b,uilding up a 
political party, or in defraying electioneering ex- 
penses. They are used to promulgate through the 
press, and by the living voice, the truths of freedom, 
which convert men's iiearts to the cause. We give 
a guaranty for the economical and judicious disposal 
of them, by providing for their expenditure by the 
. Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Without go- 
ing .bacli for years, to recapitulate former help, the 
beneficial consequefices of which are in perpetual 
flow, we will simply state that the nett proceeds of 
this last year's Fair were twenty-one hundred 
DOLLARS, exclusive of many small appropriations 
and the necessary expenses ; and that, lacking the 
prospect of this aid, neither the hundred Western 
Convention, nor the shundred Conventions now in 
progress through Massachusetts, would have been 
undertaken. The influence of the cause might be 
increased ten-fold, by means of that aid from the 
Commonwealth generally, which it is disposed, if 
the way were open, to afford. A few words of sug- 
gestion may open this way. Permit us to make 
them for the cause's sake. 

First. We entreat whomsoever this sheet 
reaches instantly to announce an intention of aiding 
the ELEVENTH MASSACHUSETTS ANTI- 
SLAVERY FAIR, and to form, if possible, a little 
circle tor weekly anti-slavery effort through the 
year. Gain all the aid possible, but wait for no one 
else. Whoever begins will be the nucleus round 
which much help will gather at length. 

Second. To remember that there is nothing 
useful or ornamental— no mechanical, agricultural, 
or manufacturing product — nothing either to eat, 
drink or wear — no work of taste or art, for house- 
hold use or decoration — but will (so perfect have 
our arrangements at length become) be made aa 
available to the cause as its worth in money. 



Third. To correspond with us for the purpose 
of benefiting us by your suggestions, and receiving 
the aid of ours. For it may often be in the power 
of all the friends of the cause, mutually to aid each 
other by the interchange of materials and labor, 
and by furnishing the newest patterns of articles of 
dress, or models of articles of furniture. 

There surely needs no searching argument or el- 
oquent appeal to commend the cause of freedom 
and humanity to professed Republicans and Chris- 
tians. All see and feel that it is a good and a no- 
ble thing to spring to the relief and rescue of one 
human being undergoing wrong, or peril, or suffer- 
ing. But here are well-nigh THREE MILLIONS, 
undergoing all the suffering, wrong, and peril 
of SLAVERY, that incarnation of all that is dread- 
ful to the sons and daughters of Massachusetts, 
while all that universal man holds dear and holy is 
endangered by the existence of such a blighting in- 
stitution. Righteous principle dies out — good feel- 
ing is extinguished — our country is endangered — 
our character as a people dishonored : and will not 
you, who admire a single act of devotedness, though 
done but for a single human being, be true to your 
own moral nature, and gladly give time, labor, mon- 
ey, prayer, sacrifice, that so you may save a nation 
— redeem a race — ennoble an age.^ 

Let us hear from you speedily, and consider us 
your servants for the cause's sake,
