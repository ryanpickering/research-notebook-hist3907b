FARM WORK FOR JANUARY. 
I Summer is the season for prepar- 
ing food, winter for disposing of it. 
"Whatever grain or other produce of 
the farm is now on hand, beyond 
what is wanted for home consumption, 
should be carried to market. Dont let 
frost, rot, mildew, vermin, waste or too 
much care swallow up the profits. 
Perishable articles should at once be 
sold for whatever they will bring. All 
others may be sold when they will 
command the best price, but in wait- 
ing for a higher, see that the waste in- 
terest, and risk of holding, will not ex- 
ceed the additional price expected. 



FARM WORK FOR FEBRUARY. 

Keep the stables clean ; the yards 
i jy and well littered; the barns and 
shelters tight and warm; curry the 
cattle and horses; and always pro- 
vide salt and pure water where they 
can get them. Nearly all animals like 
clay, tar, and sulphur occasionally; 
provide these within their reach, and 
their health and appetite will be im- 
proved by them. 

If labor is cheaper than fodder," cut i 
the hay, straw and cornstalks, and cat- 
tle will eat them clean; they will 
thank and pay you for it too, if a little 
meal be added.

FARM WORK FOR MARCH. 

Tap the maple trees if the weather 
has not before required it ; clean the 
troughs, and see that the sap is entirely- 
pure till congealed into prime sugar. 

Look well after the cattle ; feed the 
cows and ewes with young, a few 
roots daily, and see they have a quiet, 
dry, warm place, where they will not 
be knocked about by the other animals. 

Shade and fruit trees may be set out 
wherever the ground is dry; grafts 
should be selected and cut, and remem- 
ber, the best kind of fruit may give you 
ten times the profit, and cost you no 
more than the worst. 



FARM WORK FOR APRIL. 

Bestir yourselves about the gardep, 
and sow early peas, cabbage, radishes, 
lettuce, parsnips, carrots, beets and 
tomatoes ; plant a few early potatoes, 
cucumbers and melons ; by planting 
the last on a well prepared bed of ma- 
nure and loam and sand, protected by 
glass, you will get them very early. 
.A little time and money spent in this 
way, is much better than laid out in 
fine clothes and expensive groceries. 
They are the best luxuries, and pro- 
mote health and comfort. Tag the j 
sheep, and dont turn out cattle too ear- 
ly, let the grass first get a good start.

FARM WORK FOR MAY. 

Finish all the plowing, planting, and 
sowing. Early crops are more sure 
than late. Brine your wheat and soak 
your corn in saltpetre ; the crows and 
worms will let it alone then, and you 
will have larger crops. Cart out every 
ounce of manure. It will waste as 
much in the heap in one season as in 
the ground ; and for the first you get 
nothing, for the other, a great deal. 
Dock and geld the lambs, look after 
the sheep in storms, see that they are 
well salted, and never allow them 
to remain on wet land. Geld the colts, 
calves, and pigs. 



FARM WORK FOR JUNE. 
Put the light plows and cultivators 
agoing among your corn and roots, and 
kill the weeds before they kill the 
crops. Nowhere does " a step in time 
save nine" more certainly, than in ex- 
terminating weeds. Finish planting 
potatoes, and sow ruta-baga. Dont be 
afraid of getting an over stock. What 
you cant sell at a round profit, you can 
feed to advantage. Look after the red 
root, cockle, and wild mustard in the 
grain fields, and pull them all up be- 
fore they get to seed. Prune your 
fruit trees, spade up the turf about the 
trunk, place manure, &c, around them.

FARM WORK FOR JULY. 
Buy your scythes, rakes, cradles, 
&c, before the good ones are all gone. 
A good tool is cheap at the highest 
price, and a poor one dear at the low- 
est. Get a good horse-rake if you 
have not made one while idle in the 
winter. Fit up the hay carts and 
grease the wheels, fill up the old whis- 
ky jugs and canteens with pure wa- 
ter and a little ginger, molasses and 
vinegar, mixed with it, or milk and 
water, oatmeal and water, or water 
alone, and with a light 'lunch in abas- 
ket, the men are ready for their wort 



FARM WORK FOR AUGUST. 
Complete the haying and get the 
fodder well under cover. Cut the 
wheat, oats and barley, when the berry 
is in the dough state, and before it is 
fully ripe, and you will get more grain 
and infinitely better straw. What is 
intended for seed may stand till dead 
ripe, and see that it be gathered free 
from all weeds. If the land intended , 
for the next wheat crop be weedy, 
plow early and plow late, and leave 
not a stalk for future growth. Take 
early pears, plums and apples to mar^ , 
ket. Look to your, lightning rods.

FARM WORK FOR SEPTEMBER. 
Complete harvesting the grain, and 
if there be much of it, thrash it out 
with a machine in the field. This 
saves carting and waste, and wheat 
generally bears as good price now as 
at any time hereafter. A bushel in 
ten is thus saved which would other- 
wise be lost in six months, besides 3 
per cent in interest. This is worth 
any man's attention, who thinks " ma- 
ny a little will soon make a mickle." 
If not wanted in the yard, the straw 
may be spread on the ground, though 
it's better to feed cattle before it is fed 
to the soil. 



FARM WORK FOR OCTOBER. 
Dig all the roots and store them se- 
curely against frost and rot. Keep 
them from the sun and wet, and allow 
them to dry before housing. If stored 
in the field, see that no water is al- 
lowed to settle around the bottom, and 
a small hole left in the top of the pit 
to let ofF the gas and moisture. They \ 
should be lightly covered at first to 
prevent growth, and'before cold weath- 
er sets in, give them ample protection 
from frost, and put in a wisp of straw 
to shut out the cold nor yet prevent 
escape of gas. Gather all the fruit 
before the heavy frosts.

FARM WORK FOR NOVEMBER. 
Prepare for winter quarters now 
with all your might. Put the children 
to their winter's school, and see that 
you have a good master, good disci- 
pline, good books, and attractive rooms, 
well warmed and well aired. If you 
expect good cattle, you first look for 
good calves ; and if you wish good men 
and women, you, must first secure 
good children. Repair all the barns 
and sheds so as to exclude wind, rain 
and snow. Take off the cattle from 
the meadows in time to prevent injury 
to the tuff. Soon as the grass is much 
injured by frost, take off all the stock, 



FARM WORK FOR DECEMBER. 
All cattle now require increased at- 
tention. Tis a practice with some, to 
j ust keep their stock through the win- 
ter and let them do their thriving in 
summer. This is bad policy, or rather 
no policy at all. Half the age of stock 
is thus thrown away. They may be 
gaining as rapidly in winter as in sum- 
mer, if provided with shelter and ap- 
propriate food. Ashes, chareoal and 
lime, should be placed around the 
trunks of fruit trees. The first will 
kill the worms and insects harboring ' 
about the roots, and prevent the mice 
burrowing around the bark.

STRAINING AT GNATS AND SWALLOWING CAMELS. 

It will take the light of eternity to reveal all the influences that have 
wrought the above degeneracy in the Presbyterian church. In the provi- 
dence of God, however, some of her sins in this thing are " open beforehand 
going to judgment." One of them is at hand. It will be interesting and 
instructive, probably, to all religious brokers and stock-jobbers in the man- 
trade. It is as follows: At the meeting of the General Assembly, at Pitts- 
burg, in 1836, the Trustees of the funds of the church reported respecting the 
successful operation they had lately made, to increase the revenues of the 
church, by a sale of certain northern securities, and the investment of the 
proceeds in bank stock at Vicksburgh and Grand Gulf. One transaction was 
dwelt upon with great interest : among the stocks so transferred, were a 
number of shares in the Hackensack Bridge Company, N. J., concerning 
which the consciences of the pious had long been troubled, from the circum- 
stance that the bridge was a thorough-fare for travelling on the Sabbath, and 
a portion of the profits of this Sabbath profanation went into the treasury of 
the Lord. So the trustees relieved the tender consciences, and removed the 
scandal, by investing the funds in southern banks, to be used in buying the 
new cotton.- fields of the south-west and stocking them with negroes : from 
all which they anticipated a much larger income than a mere 6 per cent. 
interest! Tne same year, these trustees and their southern friends 
made stubborn and stout resistance to any action of the Assembly condemna- 
tory of slavery. 

Time rolled on. Four years after, in 1840, the Proceedings of the General 
Assembly (Old School) contain a report of a committee on the funds of the 
Church, the Hon. John Fine, chairman, which, though cautiously deficient in 
specific data, contains the following significant paragraph : 

" The committee regret that any previous Assembly should have approved 
of the funds of the Church being invested in the stocks of distant banks, 
with the expectation of receiving a larger income than 6 per cent, interest." The 
report states that "for one or more years this expectation was realized. But 
the Committee fear that some portion of these investments is now in extreme 
hazard. It is plain that the Assembly would not, at the present time, recom- 
mend a further investment of the Church funds in south-western backs. Is 
it not worthy of the consideration of the trustees, whether it be not the part 
of wisdom to sell the stocks of the unproductive banks as soon as it may be 
judiciously done, and invest the proceeds in securities which are less fluc- 
tuating and less hazardous." 

May 27th, 1842, brought out a statement from the " Standing committee on 
Finance," showing " the cost and estimated value of sundry stocks, and loss 
thereon." The whole cost of the stocks named, was $136,339. For some 
of these stocks a handsome premium was paid at the time of purchase, 
amounting in all to $11,331. The whole loss, as estimated in 1842, was 
$89,634. The following table shows for what the premiums were mostly 
paid, and where most of the losses were.

From this it appears that the Church paid nearly the whole of her premi- 
ums for, and realized nearly the whole of her losses from, the stocks of those 
south-western banks, that were to pay such a handsome income over 6 per 
cent, interest, and were to earn it almost wholly in the cotton and negro 



speculation of the time. What a delightful piece of pious financiering it was, 
to take the funds from the Hackensack Bridge Company, and the like, for 
conscience sake, and invest them where, besides yielding more than lawful 
interest, they would go to stimulate the trade in souls and blood ! Thank 
Heaven, " the biters were bitten." We fear they will meet an account at the 
day of judgment, not so easily settled as this. As God is true, if they repent 
not, chained, tortured, sold, and murdered men and women will meet them 
there, and ask redress. Brokers of men, how will you meet them ? 

HOW THE MAN-TRADE WAS DRIVEN AT THE TIME THE 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY FUNDS WERE LOST, 

In January, 1840, a correspondent of the United States Gazette, who signed 
himself Spectator, and whose accuracy the editor vouched for, gave an im- 
pressive account of the course of events in Mississippi, in those palmy days 
of negro speculation, that were to bring such revenues to the Presbyterian 
Church. He said : 

u In the fall of 1835, shfc'es, in great multitudes, were driven to the State, 
quadrupling any previous year. The demand abroad advanced the price. 
The competition forced the traders to give from twelve to fifteen months' 
time, adding ten per cent, interest. So soon as the planter learned he could 
purchase on time, by bills on New Orleans, he bought liberally. The traders 
soon sold all they had, returned home with the accepted bills, cashed them in 
Banks, and not only embarked in it again more largely themselves, but induced 
their friends and acquaintances also to embark in it. Every corner of the Slave- 
holding States was now ransacked, and every dwelling visited by the trader. 
Prices advanced higher and higher. The fall of 1836 is a time long to be remem- 
bered. All the public highways to Mississippi became lined — yea, literally 
crowded — with slaves. When they arrived, the immense number (swelling 
to rise of 40,000) made the callous hearts of all the traders ache. They pitched 
their tents upon the brow of every hill surrounding each town and village 
in the State, awaiting the call of purchasers. None came. The winter of 
1837 approached, and but few, very few sales were yet effected. At last they 
advertised they would give one and two years' time, by bills on New Orleans, 
adding ten percent, interest discount. 

" The terms were accepted by the planters, and many were induced to 
purchase a second, and even a third supply at from $1200 to $1800 each. All 
the slaves were soon sold. But by this time the merchants began to give 
way. Nearly all the bills made by the planters in the fall of 1835 and spring 
of 1836, at from twelve to fifteen months' time, were protested for non-pay- 
ment. The bills for the whole of the purchases in the winter and spring of 
1837 were protested for non-acceptance. The negro speculators became 
alarmed. They went to work in February and March, and in three months' 
time had secured their debts by deeds in trust and mortgages upon nearly the 
whole property of the State, in three years, the slave population of Missis- 
sippi increased from 70.000 to 160,000 slaves ! at an average cost of at least 
$1000 each! making the debt for slaves alone, in three years, swell to 
$90,000,000 ! ! From 1833 to 1837, cotton bore an exorbitantly high price. 
This, together with the increased force, induced the planter to direct all his 
energy to its cultivation, relying upon purchasing every article of consump- 
tion. He neglected to raise his corn and pork 5 he had to purchase more 
mules, horses and ploughs, open more lands, and increased his bills with the 
merchants, whom he totally neglected to pay. When the crash came, in May, 
1838, all the paper held against the planters by the merchants, or nearly all, was 
transferred to the banks, or sued upon by the merchants. The crowd of busi- 
ness in the different Courts delayed j udgment, and when judgment was at last 
obtained, the sheriffs and marshals could find nothing, scarcely, to levy upon. 
Bankruptcy and ruin among some of the merchants were inevitable ; and in 
their fall they crushed the banks. The negro-traders stood by with cold indiffer- 
ence, and beheld towns depopulated and large plantation after large plantation 
laid waste, growing up with thorns and briars, without feeling one pang of 



results. Is the Bible in favor of such things — of ignorance, vice, and wretch- 
edness — of falsehood, and debauchery, and murder — in favor of wielding the 
powers of civil government to encourage and protect the wrong-doer— and to 
drive the poor, the helpless, the friendless to desperation ? Such is the ques- 
tion which is often gravely, and sometimes triumphantly, urged on our atten- 
tion by advocates of slavery, and even by some of the professed interpreters of 
the Scriptures ! 

To insinuate that the Bible is in favor of such things as are essential to 
slavery— that it gives them the least countenance or quarter — or, that its max- 
ims, and doctrines, and examples are at all consistent with them, is to utter 
absurdities and blasphemies, from which infidelity itself, unless steeped to 
the core in hypocrisy, must recoil. Why, what more could the most impu- 
dent and malignant Atheism attempt for the subversion of Christianity ? If 
the Bible is in favor of such things as slavery consists in, no man can believe 
that it is the work of Wisdom and Goodness — that it is the record of Truth 
and Love. He may pretend and profess what he will, and support himself 
with all the sophistry which cunning itself can furnish. It is not in human 
nature, however bribed, or however tortured, to swallow such contradictions. 
What ! truth in Heaven authorize falsehood upon the earth ! — Love in Heaven 
authorize hatred upon the earth! — Equity and holiness in Heaven authorize 
stealing, adultery, and murder upon the earth. Hume, and Voltaire, and 
Paine, must, as the advocates of infidelity, yield the palm at once to such as 
make the Bible the bulwark of slavery, or derive a single weapon for its de- 
fence from the armory of Heaven, 

The Bible in favor of slavery! Do but study a little its leading maxims — 
its comprehensive precepts — its characteristic doctrines. It requires you to 
recognize in every human creature, though a- stranger or an enemy, a neigh- 
bor, a brother, another self, whom you are to love and honor accordingly. It 
requires you to work with your own hands in making provision for your ne- 
cessities, and assisting the destitute and helpless. Tasks commonly described as I 
menial and repulsive, it requires you to honor as the means of usefulness and 
blessedness — it requires you to enter deeply into the sufferings of the outraged ; 
and the forlorn — of the persecuted and the friendless — putting yourself in their ! 
place — reckoning the results and injuries to which they are exposed to your 
own account, and exerting yourself accordingly. It assures you, that in the j 
day of final retribution, you shall rise to Heaven or sink to Hell, as you have 
been true or false to the claims of a world-embracing philanthropy — especially 
as you have consented or refused to exert yourself for the relief of the victims 
of want, disease, and oppression. The Bible the bulwark of slavery ! — The 
armory whence it may derive its w-eapons of annoyance or defence ! — Why, 
in those very passages to which cunning and cruel men refer in defence of 
slavery, the master, the employer, is required to maintain his relations to the 
servants he employs, justly and equitably — to act on the j-rinciples of 
the Divine Government. The Apostle Paul in the very letter in which 
many thoughtless creatures assert that he lent his countenance and support 
to slavery, gives us all distinctly to understand, that instead of entreating, he 
might justly have required Philemon to treat Gnesimus every way as his 
equal. In the Corinthian Church, he-forbids the most menial of its mem- 
bers to be " the servants of men" whoever might attempt to reduce them to folly 
— might urge upon them such demands as were inconsistent with the Chris- 
tian profession. The Bible is everywhere in this matter at one with itself. 
To every seeing eye and true heart — to every manly spirit, this is evident 
enough. 

The Bible in favor of slavery ! Why, with minute particularity and fright- 
ful emphasis, it condemns, and denounces, and execrates every element and 
feature of slavery. — Can it justify as a whole what it condemns in detail ? That 
is not the way of the Bible So indeed they acknowledge who affirm that it will 
ultimately effect the abolition of slavery. It does not support to-day what it 
will overthrow to-morrow! If the Bible is, as most men profess to believe, 
hereafter to root up every form of slavery, it must do so by virtue of its char- 
acteristic principles — it must do so by virtue of its inherent and determined 



opposition to slavery. Can it be expected to extirpate what it regards, with 
indulgence or complacency. To expect, then, the abolition of slavery from 
its influence, must be to admit what this paper asserts, that it is now totally 
and irreconcilably inconsistent with slavery 5 — its maxims, and doctrines, and 
examples are in deadly confliet with if. 

Am I my Brother's Keeper? 

But however bad and hurtful — however wicked and destructive slavery 
may be, it is-, we are often told, none of their business who are beyond its influ- 
ence — who live where it does not exist. Beyond its influence! — w here is 
that 1 Are not all human hearts united in indissoluble fellowship ? Is not 
every man a member of the- family to which I belong?. Are- we not mutually 
affected by the characters we maintain— by the 1 condition in which We maybe 
placed ? Can he suffer wrong and I escape with impunity 1 If slavery exists 
anywhere in the human family, we cannot be beyond its influence. If it is 
the business of one man, it must be the business- of all men. Whatever 
touches humanity, touches every partaker of humanity. 

What ! bound "to- preach the- Gospel to- every creature/ 5 ' and is slavery 
none of our business % The slave- is entitled to receive what we are 
bound to impart. The law oflove was designed for his benefit as well as for 
ours; and we are bound to exert ourselves to bring- hinrunder its protection — 
to secure for him all the heavenly influence it is adapted to exest. This clear- 
ly is the voice of nature and the demand of the Gospel. How can we yield 
to such wants and listen to this voice, while we treat his wants and woes as 
none of our business? 

We sustain to him specific antf significant relations. In the ecclesiastical, 
political, and economical spheres, we are bound to him by special ties. We 
are in various ways able to exert a controllings influence over the absurd and 
destructive arrangements by which he is crushed. We may plead his cause, 
not only impressively, but authoritatively. We may exert ourselves effect- 
ively for his deliverance. Can such a matter benone of ovjc business? 

Slavery in various ways is a manifest and deadly injury to us. It wastes 
our substance, assails our reputation, reduces our strength, involves us in 
danger, neutralizes- our influence, counteracts every way the great design 
of our existence. It threatens us with utter and irremediable ruin; If it is 
none of our business,, what business have we 1 in this world ? 

M<)R>Ali SUA-SIOKv 

Is not ■ this the Alpliw ami Ornegw of the dnti- Slavery enterprise? Moral 
suasion is undoubtedly good ; — but for what ? It is hardly " worth while" 
to persuade, merely to produce persuasion. Persuasion is a means to an 
end. Of course it derives, in every case-,. its significance from, the objects 
to which it looks. An. earnest soulwill care very little for any form of moral 
suasion, which has nothing to do with the Active Faculty. If you try to 
1 convince and pursuadehira, he will demand as a condition of listening to you, 
that as the result of your argument, you- propose something to be done, and 
something worthy of his high destiny and solemn responsibilities. It is, doubt- 
less, important to convince people that slavery is wrong and ruinous. But 
why 1 Surely not that they may rest in any such convietion. What good sould 
that do ? They- must be persuaded of the evil of slavery, that they may exert 
themselves for its abolition. But where ? Wherever they can reach it 
through the relations they sustain. In every sphere where they have any re- 
sponsibilities- to- honor, they must,, if slavery there produces its snaky tongue, 
assail the monster. It may seek a refuge in the sanctuary, the ballot-box, or 
the exchange. If they do not try to bruise its head wherever it emits its poi- 
sonous breath, moral suasion has done them, little good. It needs itself to be 
persuaded. 

But all this some professed abolitionists seem to deprecate. Such a course, 
they affirm, would remove us from the " Anti-Slavery Platform." — But, 
what was the stuff the said platform was made of? Were we not drawn to- 
gether by the attractive power of certain principles ? Did we not swear alle- 



giance one and all to these as a manifestation of the Godhead ? Were we not 
thus brought to clasp hands and unite hearts in the Anti-Slavery enterprise ? 
Could we pledge ourselves to confine the application of these principle within 
any specified limits— 4© any specified objects or modes of execution ? Any 
such engagement must have been totally and glaringly inconsistent with the 
regard we professed for the organic principles which bound us together. We 
might as well have pledged ourselves to each other, that as abolitionists, we 
would not obey the law of progress. We must in that case have formed an 
absurd and wicked conspiracy against all that is true, and sacred, and venerable. 
The principles of our organization are, of course, the basis of our enterprise — 
they furnish the only platform on which we could ever stand for a single mo- 
ment. To refuse to give these principles any natural application in whatever 
direction, must be to depart from the An ti- Slavery platform. It must be to 
renounce the objects which the Anti-Slavery enterprise was designed to pro- 
mote, 

Political Action. 

We are in politics, as everywhere else, to act in character. Here, as every- 
where else, our activity is to be a fair expression of our principles. We can- 
not otherwise maintain our integrity and power — cannot otherwise exert upon 
mankind a healthful influence. Through our political responsibilities, we are 
to confer upon the world substantial benefits, or to inflict upon it heavy inju- 
ries. The cause of freedom, especially, cannot but be affected well or ill by our 
aims and activity nere. 

In our political sphere, slavery claims to be at home. Here, it publishes 
its maxinas, and sets up its pretensions, and defines it position, and shapes its 
arrangements, and enacts its laws — labors by night and by day, cunningly 
and unweariedly, to fortify itself. Here, it multiplies its victims, and tries 
hard to legalize absurdities which shock credulity itself, and outrages which 
no form of patience, however trained and tried, can endure. If even three true 
men meet each other in the political sphere, alive, as they must be, to the 
claims of freedom, and hostile as they must be to every form of slavery, how 
can they help forming a Liberty Party ? Are they not such in principles, 
aim, and. spirit % Are they not such in the convictions, affections, and pur- 
poses they cherish ? Such are they not in everything distinctive in their 
characters ? How can they be anything else, then, in their plans, methods, and 
exertions ? If they are united in aim, principles, and spirit, can they as 
sincere men, be other than one Mi expresshig themselves, in their activity ? As 
they are a Liberty Party at hearty must they not in head and hand also be a 
Liberty Party ? 

Can such men, whether few or many, be expected to choose parties pledged 
to the support of slavery as their coadjutors ? To act with them ? Such in- 
quiries imply a contradiction flat and strong enough to suffocate anybody 
who may attempt to swallow it. What sort of an opposition to slavery 
should we be likely to make in alliance with its cunning and determined sup- 
porters •? In alliance with those who require us to go with them in raising 
to the high places of the Republic, candidates who defend and practise slavery 
— who go the length ef maintaining, that long persistence in it" sanctions and 
sanctifies it?" 



THE LIBERTY PARTY.] 
Why is SE needed ? What are its objects ? What are its principles ? WJiat 
are its measures ? What are its prospects S 

Answer. 
1 It rs needeb, because there are three millions of Slaves in our boasted 
Republic, held in the most abject and degrading bondage by the combined 
strength of the entire nation ; involving our whole country in the guilt and 
disgrace of a system that outrages humanity, insults God, corrupts morality, 
destroys industry, and reduces the first principles of human liberty and free 
government to idle abstractions. 



au^-'aaa 



It is needed, because the National Government, under all its successive 
administrations, has been unrighteously wielded for the support of this inhu- 
man and anti-republican system. It is needed, because the Executive, 
Judiciary, Legislative, Diplomatic, Military ard Naval powers of the Union 
are become the mere drudges and tools of the slaveholders, who are less than 
250.000 in number, yet control our seventeen millions of inhabitants, and 
in such a manner as, from time to time, may best cripple the energies of! 
the free States, and strengthen the slave system. It is needed, because there ! 
is no other political party in the United States that does not calculate upon j 
the support of slaveholders, and, for that cause, refuse to take direct action j 
against slavery, and in fact, do its bidding, by supporting slaveholders for the i 
highest offices in the nation. It is needed, because no moral suasion can' 
retain moral power that is wielded by those whose political power is wielded j 
in an opposite direction. It is needed, because slavebolding exists in this j 
country as a political institution, and must be overthrown by political action ; 
and because the abolition of slavery, whenever and wherever it takes place, is 
simply the repeal of the slave laws. It is needed, because Liberty and Slavery- 
are opposites, and cannot live together in the same country for any great 
length of time ; and passing events show that the liberties of the whole coun- 
try will speedily be lost, unless the slave system is abolished. m 

2. The objects of the Liberty Party, are " the abolition of slavery by 
moral and political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of the United 
States," — and the administration of the Government in accordance with the 
spirit of the Constitution, as set forth in its Preamble, and in the Declaration 
of American Independence, applying the doctrine of equal and inalienable 
human rights to the solution of" all questions naturally arising in the direction 
of public affairs, and within the constitutional limits of legislative, executive, 
and judicial action. 

3. The Principles of the Liberty Party, (as already implied) are those of 
our great National Charter — " that all men are created equal, and are endowed 
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness," — " That for the security of these rights, 
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers," (under 
God) " from the consent of the governed," irrespective of color or caste : — 
" That it is always safe and wise to do right — and always unwise and unsafe 
to do wrong." 

4. The Measures of the Liberty Party, corresponding with its objects and 
its principles, will bear directly upon the removal of the abuses on account of 
which it is needed All the Constitutional powers of the Government it will 
wield for the abolition of slavery, instead of wielding them for its support. 
The power of the national government over slavery in the District of Colum- 
bia, Territories, and inter- State slavetrade admits of no National question. 
Here then, undoubtedly, and at once, the Liberty Party, in power,, would 
decisively act. In many other ways, and particularly by withholding all 
offices within the gift of the national government from slaveholders, it could 
act in opposition to slavery in a way against which no Constitutional objec- 
tions could be made. Add to this, the fact that many reflecting and inquiring 
minds, (in and out of the Liberty Party) are beginning to call in question, if 
not wholly to deny, the legality and constitutionality of slavery in any part 
of the United States, and it is evident that the Liberty Party, when in power, 
will not be at a loss for Constitutional measures for affecting its chief and 
paramount object. And in all minor objects, the same principles will furnish 
it with a sure guide. 

5. The Prospects of the Liberty Party are identified, therefore, with the 
prospects of the abolition of slavery, the preservation of civil liberty, and the 
use of civil government in this country, for the objects for which it was 
instituted among men. 

What prospects are there then, do you think, dear reader, that the enterprise 
will succeed 1 What prospect is there, that you and your neighbors will lend, 
your aid and co-operation ? 



IS SLAVERY CONSTITUTIONAL ? 

This question is comparatively a new one, with the greater part of 
abolitionists themselves. And therefore it will be interesting to know the 
argument of those who contend that slavery is unconstitutional. There is 
no harm in free discussion, but ^nuch good. The reader of the anti-slavery 
Almanac may be pleased to read some hints which will be useful to all who 
would impartially examine the question. 

We have all been educated in the belief that slavery in the States is not 
incompatible with the national Constitution. But it should be remembered 
that all our constitutional expositions have been given us by those who have 
only re-echoed the sentiments of the slaveholders themselves. 

Another remarkable fact is, that the argument in favor of constitutional 
slavery is never framed in accordance, either with the Spirit of the Constitu- 
tion, nor yet with the principle of Strict Construction, making out the whole 
argument by either one of these standards. Instead of this, the argument runs 
backwards and forwards, first insisting on strict construction and then, for want 
of the words and phrases needed, running back upon supposed intentions, but 
leaving wholly out of sight the declared intentions of the document itself in 
its Preamble. So, that the result is reached, neither by following the strict 
letter nor yet the living spirit of the Constitution — but by a sort of dodging, 
hide-aRd-seek evolution between the two. 

And still another circumstance should modify, somewhat, an over confident 
assumption that the ordinary construction is the correct one. While most 
persons readily reject the doctrine that slavery in the States is unconstitu- 
tional, they almost as readily affirm that which is difficult to be distinguished 
(when carefully considered) from a denial of its constitutionality. For 
example, all men will say that the spirit of the Constitution is to be known 
by its Preamble, and that this spirit is the same as that which pervades the 
Declaration of Independence, by which our government came into being. 
All reasonable men will say, likewise, that there can be nothing more directly 
and manifestly repugnant to the Declaration of Independence, and to the Pre- 
amble of the Constitution, than is the slave system. Now it deserves inquiry, 
how far this almost universal concession falls short of -amounting to a conces- 
sion that slavery is unconstitutional, when tested by the spirit of that instru- 
ment? Can that be constitutional which is hostile to the Constitution'? 
And if slavery be hostile to the Constitution, hew can it appear that the 
Constitution is not hostile to slavery? As they are both "political institu- 
tions,"" how can they both stand together if they be opposites ? 
' And if a resort be had to the strict dead letter construction (instead of the 
spirit), how stands the case then? Why, not a word or syllable concerning 
slaves or slavery, or correctly describing them, appears in the document! 
No exception, therefore, is made to the declared intent in the Preamble to 
" establish justice" and " secure the blessings of liberty," — the meaning of 
which (either by the " spirit" or by the " strict letter") can admit of no ques- j 
tion. 

The " supposed intentions" of the framers, to provide for returning fugitive 
slaves, &c, &c, is, however, urged in this place. But can their supposed \ 
intentions which they did not express, (and of which the people adopting the 
Constitution knew nothing), do away and nullify the intentions expressed in the 
Preamble? Shall the minor object, supposed to be held by the framers, set 
aside the gi-and declared object of the instrument itself? And besides, the 
Madison papers tell us expressly, that the clause concerning " persons held 
to service and labor," was first written " servitude" But " on -motion of Mr. 
Randolph, the word servitude was struck out, and the word service unani- 
mously inserted, the former being thought to express the condition of slaves, 
and the latter the obligation of free persons." — Vol. iii., p. 1569 

By the strict letter and living spirit of the Constitution, " the United States 
shall guaranty to every State in this Union, a republican form of government," 
"no State shall pass any bill of attainder" or "laws impairing the obligation 
of contracts," and " no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property," 
(says an amendment), " without due process of law." — And " Congress shall have 



power''' — "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying 
into execution all the foregoing powers." 

According to the definitions of republican government by Jefferson and 
Madison, no slaveholding State can he a republic. Slavery is extinct when- 
ever the State " bills of attainder" and " laws impairing the obligation of con- 
tracts" are set aside as unconstitutional. And where are the slaves in the 
natron who were deprived of liberty by "due process of law?' r This latter 
provision being an amendment, like the codicil to a Will, repeals and annuls 
whatever in the original instrument, might have conflicted with it. 

And more than all this. The original thirteen States abolished slavery by 
their Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, and the declaration, never 
repudiated or repealed, is still binding, and constitutes the basis of our con- 
stitutional law. The Courts in Massachusetts, declared slavery illegal in 
that State, on account of the declaration that all men are born equal.* And 
slavery in all the States rests upon the same legal grounds. The lack of 
judicial decisions to that effeet in those States, does not make slavery legal 
there, any more than the lack of such a decision in England, prior to the 
decision of Lord Mansfield in the case of John Somerset, in' 1772, made 
slavery constitutional in England up to that time, which the decision 
affirmed it had not been. 

If the government, established by the Federal Constitution cannot abolish 
slavery, then it can neither " establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, 
provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, nor secure the 
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." It can accomplish no 
one of the declared objects of its organization. More than ail this. If the 
Constitution be not against slavery, then it is in its favor r and consequently 
in favor of subverting the liberties of the people, by subjecting them to the 
slave power. It cannot be neutral, and the national government cannot help 
sustaining slavery or else acting against it. 

Such are some of the views and sentiments that a portion of the people 
are beginning to entertain. Do they not deserve the careful attention of all 
who take an interest in the national welfare 1 Should not the members of 
the Liberty Partv, in particular, examine the subject attentively ? 

W. G. 



DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION, 

Among the earnest friends of civil liberty, there are a few who seem to 
despair of ever succeeding in the enterprise of bringing the National Govern- 
ment under the influence of the principles of the Declaration of Independence, 
and so they are in favor of the dissolution of the Union. They either think 
that the Constitution is a compromise in favor of slavery, or else (nearly or 
quite the same thing), that it does not clothe Congress with any efficient 
powers for the overthrow of the slave system. They say — and truly enough 
— that the liberties of the North will be sacrificed, if we continue to remain 
subservient as we have been, to the slave power. And they urge (what no 
intelligent friend of human liberty will deny), that the end ought not to be 
sacrificed, for the preservation of the means — and that the Constitution and 
the Union ought not to be preserved at the expense of the liberties of the people, 
which they were designed to secure. Theannexation of Texas r which they think 
to be inevitable, they consider such a violation of the Constitution as releases 
us from its obligations, and they look forward with dismay, to the time when 
the new States formed out of Texas, will so completely throw the national 
government into the hands of the slaveholders, that the North, though united, 
will find itself in the minority, and unable to move. 

Though this view is not held, to any great extent, in the Liberty Party, 
yet it is urged on their attention by strong-minded men., and the tendency is 
to discourage anyfurtheiattempts to preserve the Constitution and the Union, 



* Such is the phraseology of the Massachusetts Bill of Eights, hut the word " created" is 
more properly used in the Declaration of Jnclependence. 



by placing the administration of the general government in right hands. Let 
us look, then, for a moment, at the brighter side of the picture. 

Texas is not yet, quite annexed. And the good Providence of God, smiling 
on human vigilance, may yet defeat that wicked measure. But if it takes 
place, some time at least, must elapse, before the increased population of 
Texas will materially strengthen the slave power in the national government. 
" Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof." While the free States have the 
power, it is their duty to wield it, and they should be urged to the performance 
of that duty, and not to a premature retreat from it. " While there is life, 
there is hope." When the free States shall have become abolitionized enough 
to " dissolve the Union" on account of slavery, they will have become abolition- 
ized enough to wield the government for the overthrow of slavery, unless 
(which is not probable) they should be out-voted by the slave States, and then 
it would be in time to withdraw. Until then, it is our business to seek the 
overthrow of slavery, " by moral and political action as prescribed by the Constitu- 
tion of the United States." This was the work the Abolitionists originally 
undertook, and they ought not to be disheartened in their work. Perhaps it 
will be found, on examination, that the Constitution contains no compromises 
with slavery, but arms the national government against it. A dissolution of 
the Union, now, would not be a division of liberty from freedom. The strong- 
holds of pro-slavery sentiment and feeling are here, in the free States. 

As the annexation of Texas is unconstitutional, the same disposition and 
power in the free States to repel that wicked measure, which would be 
necessary to " dissolve the Union," would be equally available to vote Texas 
out of the Union, so long as the majority of votes is cast by the free States. 

A dissolution of the Union, as a substitute for the abolition of slavery, would 
be treachery to the anti-«lavery cause ; and a dissolution of the Union as a 
means of abolishing slavery, is too sanguinary and bloody a method for men 
of peace, while any other measure can be used. The slaves might indeed, 
free themselves by an insurrection, in that case, but it would be at the expense 
of oceans of blood. 

A political dissolution of the Union (while the free States hold the power) 
should no more be regarded as an anti-slavery measure, than is an ecclesiastical 
division, on Mason & Dixon's line, in the Methodist Episcopal Church. If either 
ecclesiastics or politicians, to get^id of the agitating subject, see fit to divide, 
rather than abolish slavery, let the responsibility rest upon themselves. 

Our obligations to remain in a Union with the South, should be estimated 
in the light of our connection with our crushed brethren in bonds, together 
with the non-slaveholding whites — the majority of our " Southern brethren" 
in distinction from the petty oligarchy that unlawfully crushes them. 

Their case we are bound to make our own. We have no moral right (were 
it possible) to slip our own necks out of the yoke, and leave them in their chains ; 
especially since we are guilty of having so long assisted in their enslavement. 

The non-slaveholding States can no more rid themselves of the guilt of: 
American slavery, by " dissolving the Union" than the controlling partner in j 
the ownership Qf a slave ship, or of a slave plantation, can wash his hands in j 
innocency, by selling out his stock, or by making it a present to his partner ! 
For the North, while holding a controlling power over slavery, to dissolve the 
Union without abolishing slavery, would only be the sealing of her own con- 
demnation in the sight of God, of posterity, and of the whole civilized world. 

To preserve the Union by the abolition of slavery, to administer the Govern- 
ment righteously, and not to abdicate or disband it, should be the work of a 
free people- This work, the Liberty Party has undertaken. Her flag is 
at the mast head, with the motto— *• Do rCt give up the Ship!" Here let us 
rally, and "work while the day lasts." "And let us not be weary in well 
doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." 

BANKS, TARIFFS, etc. 
The Liberty party contends and goes for the manhood of every human 
being in this Republic of whatever color or condition, ivhenever, wherever, and 
however assailed, whether in the crushed slave of South Carolina — the man . 



( ' "T "n' l --■ I ■ -■ mi i i i fr r rw.m . r i ■ -»- .i ■■ I 1 i«nrmr ,.„ i jM ■■ - ■ - -- -- _ — 

held as property till twenty-five, as the son of a slave, in New Jersey— the non* 
voting colored man of Pennsylvania and New York — in the negro-pew — in 
the school, or the college — in the rail-road car, or in the steamboat— in the 
withholding labor in a store, or mechanic's shop from colored men — in all 
these we go for that centre right, that equal right, that the black man's dollar 
shall go just as far as the white man's. We go for the ruined three millions 
of white men of the Slave States undone for the want of the wages of respected 
labor, annihilated, covered with rags, no schools, ignorance so thick that, like 
Egypt's darkness, it may be felt, abject', labor despised as a slave's matter. 
Six millions, three white and three colored of human beings, one third of the 
men of the Republic, victims of this dreadful desolation of a nation's best 
hopes— three millions of slaves at labor, make three millions of slaves without 
labor — three millions destroyed by working for nothing, causes three millions 
more to pine in poverty and ignorance, their souls crushed by believing that 
white men who have nothing can be respectably miserable, only by doing 
nothing, for which they are paid nothing ! - . 

Yet, with all these facts and ten thousand more staring us in the face, we 
mean as a Liberty Party not to divert or distract our attention with Tariffs 
or Free Trade, Banks or Sub-Treasuries, with Corporations sole or aggregate, 
with Peace or War. Whether it is best to have a navy for war, or sink it as a 
means of peace, whether the recruiting sergeant's or schoolmaster's wages be 
increased, whether we should refuse to open our ports to the slave products 
of Brazil and Spain, or shut them Out, whether we should sell or give away 
our public lands, whether we should use the funds of the nation, or leave it to 
the States to improve river navigation and make harbors on the great lakes, 
whether we should compel parents to send their children to school or leave 
them to do as they please, whether we should abolish the Cadet School, at 
West Point, or not, or make a rail-road to the mouth of Columbia or not, 
whether we should abolish imposts for revenue, and raise the expenses of the 
General Government by direct taxation or not, whether we should prohibit, 
by act of Congress, the importation from abroad, of all alcoholic liquors, and 
i prevent their manufacture at home, or leave it as before, and hundreds of other 
j questions may arise, which the Liberty Party will not undertake before they 
j have power to make their position respected, to settle one way or the other, 
! as a party, but will leave each person to judge for himself as he thinks right. 
But if the Liberty Party acquire power, in Congress or a State Legislature, 
j so as to be responsible for the action of the Government, either state or 
j national, the first business will be to overthrow slavery, in every form, in 
j which it may be reached, and restore all men to their rights as far as our 
■ jurisdiction extends, then if any of the foregoing questions, or others come up 
; for consideration and decision, the Liberty-Party Congress or State Legisla- 
| ture will decide upon rendered reasons, what they believe to be just and right 
! and that integrity and nobility of soul, which would cut up slavery, root and 
i branch : would do right or endeavor so to do, on these other questions, and if 
i they saw, in the progress of time they were in an error, they would have the 
i moral courage to retreat and do right. Therefore it would be a silly waste of 
time, to take up any of these questions now, and throw them into our Con- 
ventions to distract us ; for when slavery is abolished, we shall find- the great 
disturbing cause of our differences is gone, and we shall have but little to contend 
about. Most of the controversies in this country of a political character — 
our Embargo, Non-intercourse Acts, Declaration of War against England 
and the manner in which it was conducted, our Foreign Relations, Domestic 
Expenditures, the controversies between Tariff for Protection, and Tariff for 
Revenue — have grown out of this great cause of eternal envy and disturbance, 
Free and Slave Labor. A. S. 

" ONE IDEA PARTY." 

Behold this picture ! Both Whig and Democrat believe the great object of 

! government and its main design is to make dollars by Tariffs, Banks, Sub- 

I Treasuries, Free Trade, Corporations, Monopolies. Canals, Rail-roads, and by 

| obtaining the money paid for governmental jobs in the shape of salaried offi- 



ces, and in expending thirteen millions annually on the sea and land, by the 
army and navy, to keep three millions of slaves from insurrection at home, 
and other nations from invading the assailable land of unpaid and whip- 
extorted labor in the South. 

The Liberty Party, the great One Idea Party, believe that a Republican 
Government is made to protect and defend every human being in the enjoy- 
ment of his natural rights, Of life, liberty, safety and happiness, and give wages 
to all, education to all, toleration to all, protection to all — the man first, his 
clothing afterwards ; the man first, his mode of transportation afterwards; the 
man first, and currency afterwards ; the man first, and all human contingencies 
afterwards. 

The party who loves and respects the man, white, black, brown, or red, will 
see that he is fed, clothed, and furnished, and justice done his natural wants, 
because he is a man, and a man needs them. But the Whig and Democratic i 
Parties act as strangely as if they saw a man fall into the River — his hat falls 
one way, his great coat another, his pack another; these old parties cry out 
Save that hat ! Oh, save that great coat or it will be lost ! Oh, save that 
pack, or it will sink for ever. The Whigs and Democrats put out their skiffs I 
and scull for the coat, the hat and the pack; the Liberty Party cry, Oh save 
the sinking man ! and put out with their skiffs, and, by his locks, they save the 
drowning man; and will then look for the hat, coat and pack, because, as a 
man, he needs them. 

What is the gbeat hindrance in the mission fields to the esta- 
blishment OF A PRACTICAL, PERMANENT GOSPEL 1 

Anstver. Oppression. Oppression is modified slavery. In some of its 
modifications, slavery exists in almost every heathen nation on earth. 

But how does that state of society operate prejudicially to the establish- 
ment of truth ? Anstver. Everyway. It requires the gospel to "bow down 
and worship it." That is, oppressors say emphatically to missionaries, if not 
in so many words, at least by plain implication, Oppose our daily practices 
whence we derive our revenues, and we will oppose you. But lend your 
countenance and toleration to this practice, and you shall share our smiles 
and our patronage. 

Examples in ancient times. The variety of religions introduced into Rome, 
before the days of the Apostles, all bowed down to the civil authority, and 
were all tolerated. When the Apostles preached Christ, a Prince and a 
Saviour, and proclaimed their determination to obey God rather than men, both j 
they and their religion were at once outlawed. " The kings of the earth did 
set themselves, and the rulers took counsel together against the Lord, and 
against his anointed," and under their authority, and supported by their 
power, persecutions raged for centuries to such an extent, that the blood of 
j the Christians fattened the fields of their early labors. But after a time, the 
doctrine of obeying God rather than men, was entirely given up ; indeed, was 
reversed, and forthwith the civil authorities in the persons of Constantine 
and his successors became the friends and patrons of this religion. 

Modern examples. At the Sandwich Islands grievous oppression has long 
been exercised by the Chiefs over the people. The missionaries say, " If we 
had preached against oppression, and made the practice of it a bar to Church 
membership, we should have been driven away." They did not preach 
against it: they received the Chiefs to the bosom of the Church, and secured 
their patronage. But an intelligent observer, friendly to the mission, says 
that religion among the Islanders, is " without purity or virtue." 

Among the Indians upon our borders slavery exists. The language of the 
missionaries there, is, that " If we interfere with their slavery, they would 
drive us from the country." They do not interfere with it, and slaveholders 
among them are said to be their " most pious and devoted Church-members." 

In our Southern slave States, no minister is tolerated who does not so con- 
strue the gospel as to make it sustain slavery. It is so construed. The re- 
sult is an immense mass of heathenism, worse in some respects, (according 
to the showing of their own religious bodies,]^ than exists anywhere else 



on earth; and every return of the census shows that this heathenism is 
increasing more rapidly than in any other land under the whole heavens. 

There are no half-truths in God's word. There are none but practical 
truths there. The difficulty, then, in establishing a practical gospel, is simply 
the difficulty in preaching the whole truth. Oppression everywhere demands 
that the whole truth shall not be spoken. As far as that demand is complied 
with, the practical nature of the gospel is impaired, its fine gold is dimmed-— 
its purity and power diminished, and its permanency shaken. 

OLD TINKEM OF TRENTON. 

An extract from Alvan Stewart's argument before the Supreme Court of 
New Jersey : 

" Slavery is a matter in invitum, and the party most interested can have no 
voice in making a contract. To illustrate one of the abhorrent features of the 
institution in the slave States, Mr. Stewart, adverting to one of the positions 
of the opposite counsel, supposed the following case. An old man, said he, 
whom we will call Tinkem, lived in Trenton, once upon a time, and not being 
long for this world, called his ten sons around him and told them, ' My sons, I 
have but little to give you of worldly property, and therefore, in order to start 
the five oldest of you comfortably in this life, I give each of them one of their 
five younger brothers, to be his property,— in other words, his slave, for life, 
and his posterity after him. And you, the five youngest of my sons, must be the 
slaves of your elder brothers. I do this in conformity with the usage of the 
citizens of a large number of the States of this Union !' But the eldest son 
says, ' Father, what are the rights and prerogatives which we shalj, in that 
case, possess over our slave brothers V ' Oh,' says the old man, ' you will re- 
duce them to chattels, or cattle, — living, breathing property, — that is all. It 
is perfectly legal, and you will be protected in the enjoyment of your property ; 
you are no longer to regard them as sentient beings ; you are to deprive them 
of all education, except the cart- whip instruction; you are to make them 
know and feel that their every moment is to be regulated by your wish and 
will, and that they are subject to be sold, and worked, husband apart from 
wife, and wife from husband ; and their children from both* So, now, my 
son, take your slaves and begone!' Now (continued Mr. Stewart), the story 
of this horrible deed reaches the ears of the citizens of Trenton, and the sanc- 
tums of its editors. A burst of indignation is the consequence. Everybody 
and every press exclaims " Monster ! monster! monster !" with one voice. It 
is taken up by the people, and the press of Philadelphia and New York, and 
language grows weak, and imagination weary,in searching for fitting epithets, 
in which to.condemn the foul and damning act of this heartless old villain, Tink- 
em of Trenton ! Men come from a prodigious distance to get a sight of so much 
moral deformity, existing in a single man. The phrenologists come to exa- 
mine his craniologica! developments, wondering what manner of man-monstei 
he can be ; and the whole nation rings with the story, and but one opinion is 
expressed, everywhere, in public and in private, — and that of horror and aston- 
ishment. But, your honors, pause in your honest outburst of indignation. 
Old Tinkem stands excused, in view of the fact that not a week comes and 
goes in the regions of the sunny south, that does not furnish a parallel to his 
conduct. A slaveholding father there gives the children of his own body, by 
his bond woman, to be slaves for life, to his children by his free-woman, — I 
mean his wife ! It is done in twelve states out of the six-and-twenty of which 
this Union is composed, whenever the father wishes to endow his heir out of 
his possessions. And this I hold to be slavery in the length and breadth of 
its fiagitiousness ; it is yet but one phase of its abounding villainy. The pic- 
turcis startling, frightful, revolting ; but it is neither overdrawn, nor too high- 
ly colored. 



THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. 

Of the fourteen presidential terms, now expired since the formation of the 
government, eleven have been filled by slaveholders, one by a " northern man 
with southern principles," and only two by northern men. The present in- 
cumbent is a slaveholder, sworn fully to do his utmost to uphold, and even 
extend the abomination. 

During the twenty years, ending in 1832,. there were six presidential elec- 
tions. In these, the south cast 608 electoral votes, but only 41 of them for 
northern candidates. During the twenty years, ending in 1835, there were 
five presidential elections, in which the south cast 515 electoral votes, only 
11 of which were for northern candidates. 

By holding the Presidency, slavery controls the cabinet, the diplomacy, the 
army, and the navy of the country. The power that controls the Presidency 
controls the nation. 

THE VICE^PRESIDENCY AND SENATE. 
The President exercises much of his power by and with the Senate. The 
Senate is equally divided between the free and slave states. The Vice-Presi- 
dent of the United States is ex-officio President of the Senate. As such, he 
has the casting vote in all questions before that body. For the last twenty 
years, with one exception, he has been a Slaveholder. 

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
The speaker of the House has the appointment of all committees, and of 
course exerts an immense influence in this, as well as other ways, in the 
legislation of the country. Since 1809, with two short exceptions, the speak- 
ers have always been slaveholders'. 

THE ARMY AND NAVY. 

The free states generally have furnished the seamen and the soldiers; the 
men to do the fighting and endure the hard knocks : but slavery has taken rare 
to furnish southern men for officers. Northern men could not be trusted to look 
after southern interests (which has of late been the principal employment of 
the army and navyj so well as southern men can be. So the slave states sup- 
ply all the generals and commodores, the colonels and captains, the lieu- 
tenants and midshipmen. So the south, without commerce to protect, are 
always anxious to increase the navy, as - it furnishes comfortable berths for so 
many of her idle and helpless sons. For this reason, also, it is sometimes 
found almost impossible to man our ships of war, because free sailors cannot 
endure the treatment they receive from officers who have been accustomed to 
command slaves-. .•*. 

Of 1054 naval officers, New England has only 172. 

Of the 68 commanders, New England has only 11 

Of the 328 lieutenants, New England has only 59. 

Of the 562 midshipmen, New England has only S2. 

And New England owns nearly half the tonnage of the country ! 

DOTH NOT NATURE TEACH? 

The Rev. C. C. Jones, who has made some noise within the last few years 
in respect to the religious instruction of the slaves at the South, has a section 
in his Catechism prepared for the " oral instruction," on the " duties of ser- 
vants," in which is the following passage : 

" Q. Is it right for the servant to rwn away, or is it right to harbor a runa- 
way % 

"A. No. 

" Q. What did the apostle Paul to Onesimus, who was a runaway ? Did 
he harbor him, or send him back to his master ? 

"A. He sent him back to his master with a letter. — Philemon, vs. 1-25." 

In his last (the 10th) annual report, respecting the efforts of himself and ' 
otheis in this work, Mr. Jones informs us how the negroes appreciate this j 
part of his instructions. He says : 



"Allow me to relate a fact, which occurred the spring of this year, illus- 
trative of the character and knowledge of the negroes at this time. I was 
preaching to a large congregation on the Epistle to Philemon >• and when I 
insisted upon fidelity and obedience as Christian virtues in servants, and upon 
the authority of Paul, condemned the practice of running aioay, one half of 
my audience deliberately rose up and walked off with themselves, and those 
that remained looked anything but satisfied, either with the preacher or his 
doctrine. After dismission, there was no small stir among them : some sol- 
emnly declared ' that there was no such an epistle in the Bible ;' others 
'that it was not the gospel ;' others, ' that I preached to please the masters | 
others, ' that they did not care if they ever heard me preach again.' V 

The negroes were evidently the better informed of the two. Nature is a 
better expounder of the Bible, as well as of common honesty, than a slave- 
holder. This is not the first time that Satan has found it convenient to 
quote scripture to serve his purpose. And as Christ said, when the thing 
was tried upon him, " Get behind me, Satan," so we do not wonder that na- 
ture Itself should, in the present case, cry out upon such religion as a lie, 
and turn from it with instinctive and indignant loathing. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. 

This body, in 1787, recommended it to all their people to use the most pru- 
dent measures, consistent with the interests of the state of civil society in 
the countries where they live, to procure eventually the final abolition of 
slavery in America. 

They re-afiirmed the same judgment in 1703. „ 

In 1794, the General Assembly adopted certain "scripture proofs and 
notes" to the Confession of Faith. Note b. appended to a question of the 
larger Catechism upon the eighth commandment, was as follows : 

" I, Tim. i., 10. The law is made for man-stealers. This crime, among the 
Jews, exposed the perpetrators of it to capital punishment ; Ex. xxi., 16; and ! 
the apostle here classes them with sinners of the first rank. The word he I 
uses, in its original import, comprehends all who are concerned in bringing j 
any of the human race into slavery, or in retaining them in it. Hominwn 
fures, qui servos vel liberos abdtbcunt, retinent, vendimt, vel emimt. Stealers of men 
are all those who bring off slaves or freemen, and keep, sell, or buy them. 'To 
steal a freeman,' says Grotius, 'is the highest kind of theft. In other instan- 
ces, we only steal human property; but when we steal, or retain men in 
slavery, we seize those who, in common with ourselves, are constituted, 
by the original grant, lords of the earth.' Gen. i. } 28. Vide Poll synopsin in 
loc. " 

This remained as the judgment of the Church for some twenty years. 
About the end of that period, a worthy abolitionist, who still lives, was 
preaching in Virginia. In good set terms, and true Christian fidelity, he as- 
sailed slaveholding, and insisted that slaveholders were men-stealers. Some 
of his Presbyterian and ministerial brethren were greatly annoyed, and sought 
to discipline him as a disorganizer. But to their surprise, he quoted not the 
Bible only, but their own Confession against them, and they were, for the time, 
obliged to stay proceedings. At once, however, they and their slaveholding 
accomplices set themselves to getting the obnoxious note out of the Confes- 
sion. They effected this, by characteristic maneuvering, in 1816. A minority 
resisted and protested, and brought the subject up again the following year. 
It was evident something must be done to cover the servile iniquity; and the 
next year, the famous Declaration of 1818 was made. It served its purpose 
admirably. Since that, slavery has nestled quietly and increased nicely in 
the bosom of the Church, until, in 1845, the Old School Presbyterian church, 
the lineal descendant in this thing of the Presbyterian church that was, has 
even gone back from the ground of 1818, and now allows and justifies slavery 
on principle and as a Bible institution. 



OCCASIONS FOR ANTI-SLAVERY ACTIVITY. 

Millions -of the human family may, in this republic be reckoned up, men, wo-: 
men, and children, who are described in the solemn language of law, as goods 
and chattels — who are bought and sold as articles of merchandise — who are 
subject to all the incidents of property, and exposed to all the insults and in- 
juries of which human nature is capable. The prerogatives they are inaliena- 
bly entitled to wield, and the privileges they are entitled to enjoy, they are 
forced every day, and everywhere, to be trodden down by violence guided by 
fraud arid by fraud armed with violence. In this condition they have been 
held age after age, the tillers of an unblest soil, which refuses to be fertilized 
by their unrequited sweat and their unavenged blood. Whatever may be the 
measure of their wrongs and wretchedness, the privilege ef seeking redress by 
urging their complaints and their petitions on the law-making power, is most 
jealously and obstinately withheld. They are expected to hold their tongues 
under the heaviest inflictions. The laws they are under, while they threaten 
them with multiplied and frightful penalties, afford them no protection. They 
may be scourged, ravished, murdered, with impunity. And the professed 
ministers ef mercy, among whom his lot is cast, task their ingenuity and 
their strength to prove that the condition of the slave is natural and healthful, 
accordant with the laws of nature and the will of Heaven, or preserve silence 
amidst the outrages perpetrated upon their fellow-men, and fellow- Christians. 
The most distinguished statesmen declare, that however wicked, when first 
introduced, slavery has been practised in this country till it has become 
" sanctioned and sanctified." They exert themselves, therefore, to render it 
as permanent as any other human relation or institution. To all the suffer- 
ings of the slave, they are for adding the sting of despair. 

American Slavery Founded in a Lie. 

Such is American slavery, not accidentally, as a matter of course, but of 
necessity from its natural and inherent tendencies. The wickedness and 
misery it involves, must be great beyond description or conception. 

It is founded on a lie, gross, impudent, and malignant in the highest degree. 
The slave is not, as it affirms, a chattel. He is essentially and constitutionally 
something else infinitely superior. He is a man. He bears even in his chains, 
he evidently bears the Divine Image ; and cannot, therefore, by any process be 
reduced to "an article of merchandise." To describe him as " an article of 
merchandise," especially in the language of the law, is to utter the most atro- 
cious falsehood. In this lie slavery has its basis. 

American slavery is, in its very nature, a complicated and comprehensive 
system of stealing, breaking up wherever it prevails the very foundation on which 
rests the right of property. Armed with the active faculty and endowed with 
the light of reason, every man is entitled, is'bound, to promote his own im- 
provement and welfare. He is authorized — he is required to assert his own 
personality. He is an I myself. In this myself] the institution of property 
has its foundation. The natural results of an activity, springing from Imy- 
•self, must of course belong to I my self. But all this slavery denies. It seizes 
on I myself and reduces personality to property. Thus the I mysdf vanishes, 
and leaves behind nothing but a chattel. If this transaction be at all valid, 
there can be no essential difference between a man and a thing, between the I 
myself in any case and a chattel; and the right of property has perished. No- 
thing remains to which this right can be attached — by which it can be asserted. 
Thus, in stealing a man — and every slave is a stolen man — slavery swallows 
up everything to which property in any case and under any form can belong. 
And nothing but fraud and violence can anywhere or any how keep up even 
the show of the relation of owner and property. No one, whether slave or 
slaveholder, can justify himself in claiming, as his own, anything whatever. 
Such is the bankruptcy to which slavery reduces every one within the sphere 
of its influence. That must be stealing with a witness which breaks up and 
bears away the only basis on which property can be held. 



American Slavery is a System of Murder, 

American slavery is a system of murder. Everything distinctively human in 
its victims, it destroys the moment it seizes on them. It denies that they 
are men — pronounces them chattels. This it does in the strongest terms, in 
the most solemn manner, and for the gravest purposes. The laws which are 
forced upon them, enact that their humanity — the man in them — is extinct. 
Whatever in the form they bear, may remain — the man, according to slavery, 
has perished. Accordingly, if a slave is killed, however wantonly and delibe- 
rately, his death is regarded as the death of a chattel. Damages m.sy be de- 
manded; but, why should the destruction of an article of merchandize be 
treated as murder ? This was committed, once for all, when he was reduced 
to slavery. And any one who studies the code of slavery, and the history of 
the judicial processes which it may have occasioned, must see that so the 
matter is there disposed of ;^-and yet, when the atrocities' which so often 
result in the destruction of slaves are described, one and another among us, 
affecting surprise, pronounce such stories incredible. Incredible ! What, 
that when reduced to a chattel, man should be treated accordingly. Why, all 
the particular atrocities which are described in the history of slavery, are no- 
thing more or less than the natural and necessary fruits of the chattel princi- 
ple, wherever and however applied to the human family. 

Their theology, and ethics, and political; economy — their existence in all its 
forms and phases,, many of our countrymen have been trying to adjust to the 
monstrous falsehood, that no essential" difference separates personality from 
property. Why make large eyes and loud exclamations, when the natural re- 
sults are forced upon us f— when we find ourselves in the spheres of theology, 
and ethics, and political economy, hemmed in on every hand by grisly spec- 
tres, squeaking and gibbering all sorts of absurdities in our ears? — when we 
hear that slavery is the corner-stone of freedom, 1 — that sin persisted in grows 
into holiness ? — and that in God's world, we are driven for counsel and pro- 
tection to the bosom of the devil ? Such nonsense and blasphemy are the 
natural product of the all-comprehensive lie, which as a people r w-e have made 
and cherished. 

When the right of property is assailed and subverted, as it must be where- 
ver slavery prevails, what within the sphere of commercial activity can be 
expected? Confusion and misery, of course. Will contracts be fulfilled and 
debts paid ? — will mutual confidence be cherished and honored ? If so, it 
must be in despite of the doctrines and arrangements which are designed to 
keep slavery in countenance. What occasion for surprise, then, that slavery 
from time to time swallows up uncounted millions, which an ill advised credit 
system recklessly throws into its wide-open insatiable jaws ? And when 
slavery has filled its multiplied brothels and slaughter-houses with human 
victims, what stupidity, to wonder that debauchery and cruelty of all sorts, 
and in every degree, should be practised there! 

It is most obvious and certain,- that unless slavery be exposed and abolished, 
the nation is undone. The very foundations of society under any healthful 
form must be broken up. Bankrupt in character, the nation must be bank- 
rupt in everything. Hence the occasion for Anti- Slavery Activity.. 

The Bible Argument, 

But is not the Bible in favor of slavery ? — Slavery is founded in a- monstrous 
falsehood —breaks up the distinction between personality and property — aims 
a deadly blow at the heart of human nature, murdering the man in the man, 
destroying everything distinctively human in humanity — throws loose reins 
on the neck of passion — encourages and justifies all kinds of wrong and out- 
rage — withholds the restraints of law from those who are eager to inflict, and 
the protection of law from those who are liable to< suffer the deepest injuries — 
and dooms millions of the children of our common Father — of the redeemed 
of our common Saviour, to gross ignorance, revolting vices, and heart-rend- 
ing wretchedness. These things are essentially characteristic of Ameriean 
slavery — they enter into its very being — they are its natural and necessary 




remorse for the ruin and wretchedness they had brought upon the country; 
laughing at their own safety and security." 

And when the banks went, the General Assembly's funds and all its golden 
dreams of more than 6 per cent, interest went with them. These funds, be 
it remembered, constituted a large portion of the funds of the Church. Is it 
any wonder that the trustees and leaders of such a Church bave ever been 
ready to step forward as the apologists, patrons and defenders ©f slavery ?. 
One would think such losses might cure them of this subserviency ; but the 
doings of the last (Old School) Assembly show them to be thorough spaniels. 

HOW SLAVERY MURDERS ON°SYSTEM AND BY WHOLESALE. 

Slaveholders and their friends maintain that the slave is vastly better off 
than the free man of color. Of course the proportion of slaves who die 
should be less. But by an examination of the census for 1830, comparing the 
ages of slaves with the free people of color and supposing the ratio of deaths in 
each to be the same, it appears that between the ages of ten and twenty-four 
there should be 665,875 slaves ; whereas there are but 620,827, showing a 
deficiency of 45,048; between twenty-four and thirty-six, the working age, 
there should be 439,389 slaves — there are but 370,330, making a deficiency of 
69,058; between thirty-six and fifty-five, when decay begins to affect the 
slave, there should be 340,161 — there are only 229,782, making a waste of 
110,379; over fifty-five years of age, there ought to be 186,797 — there are but 
83,736, raising the loss to 103,061. The total deficiency, therefore, arising 
from this waste of life is 327,547 human beings prematurely worn out and 
killed on the cotton and sugar plantations of the South in the ten years pre- 
ceding 1830 ! 

By a similar estimate we have the following result from the census of 1840/ 
Between the ages of ten and twenty-four, there ought to be 829,698 slaves ; 
there are but 781,206 — deficiency 47,492, Between twenty-four and thirty-six, 
there should be 568,107; there are but 475,160 —deficiency 92,947. From 
thirty-six to fifty-five, the proper number is 444,376, actual number 284,465 — 
deficiency 159,911. The total deficiency is 444,357. It also appears from 
the census of 1840, that the increase of the slave population in the previous 
ten years was less than 25 per cent. — a large portion of which diminished 
increase must be set down to a greater loss of life. Altogether, by preventing 
the proper increase and by hastening to a premature death, slavery undoubtedly 
murdered from one-fourth to half a million of human beings in the ten years 
ending in 1840 ! 

HOW SLAVERY HEATHENIZES WHAT IT DOES NOT KILL. 

" Who would credit it, that in these years of revival and benevolent effort, 
in this Christian Republic, there are over two millions of human beings, in 
the condition of heathen, and in some respects, in a worse condition? * * 
From long continued and close observation, we believe that their (the colored 
population's) moral and religious condition is such, as that they may justly 
be considered the heathen of this Christian country, and will bear comparison 
with heathen in any country in the world." — Synod of S. C. and Ga. in 1834. 

In the New Orleans Protestant of May 3d, 1845, there is a " report on the 
religious instruction of colored persons, published by order of the N. O. Pres- 
bytery." The report states that there are within the bounds of that presbytery, 
at least 100,000 persons of color, nearly all of whom are slaves. The report 
also says that " it is a lamentable fact, too evident to be denied, that by far 
the greater part of them are famishing and perishing for want of the bread of life. 
Of the 100,000 of this class of people, within our bounds, it may be safely 
asserted that 75,000 never hear the doctrine of salvation through a crucified 
Redeemer preached, and have none to tell them ' what they must do to be 
saved.' And of the remaining 25,000, who occasionally hear the preaching of 
the gospel, not more than 5,000 enjoy its regular and constant ministrations." 

What a picture ! Ninety-five thousand out of a hundred thousand, within 
the bounds of a single presbytery, as benighted, with few exceptions, as any 
heathen on the face of the earth. 



HOW ALL THIS STRIKES DISINTERESTED AND INTELLIGENT 
CHRISTIANS ABROAD. 

At the General Anti-Slavery Conference held in London, in 1843, the Rev. 
Dr. Ritchie of Edinburgh, in discussing the resolutions recommending no 
church-fellowship with slaveholders, said : 

" O that the Church would be faithful to her Head ! that her ministers 
would remember, that He complains especially of the wounds wherewith he 
is wounded in the house of his friends. If I do not misread my Bible, the 
Church is the commissioned regenerator of the world. If then, the Church 
be corrupt, whence are to issue the healing waters ? If the salt of the earth 
have lost its savor, how is the putrid world to be recovered from its taint ? If 
justice and mercy are exiled from the Church, what can I expect but that 
they are 

' Sprung on the viewless winds to heaven again 3" 
Alas! what reports must he bear back of Christianity, who has been sent to 
learn her genius and influence from a slave-holding Church? My fancy hears 
him, on his return, questioned by his brother idolator : ' What are Christians V 
' Monsters ! They hold that their creed came from heaven, and is the word 
of salvation; and they hold it a capital crime to teach this creed to man, 
woman, or child, who has a dark face. They buy and sell men, women and 
children, and offer the profits on the altar of their God ! They sell their own 
wives, sons, and daughters, and to those who they know will work and flog 
them to death ; and this they do without the temptation of hunger or poverty. 

THE JUDGMENT OF THE WHOLE CONFERENCE. 
The Rev. John Angell James introduced to the Conference a series of 
resolutions on the subject of church-feilowship with slaveholders. These, 
after being fully discussed and warmly supported by himself, Drs. Ritchie, 
Morrison and others, were unanimously adopted, as follows : 

1. That this Convention hereby declares to the world its deliberate and 
solemn conviction that slavery, in whatever form or country it exists, is in- 
trinsically opposed to all natural justice and genuine Christianity ; that in 
proportion as these exert their legitimate vigor and influence in society, it 
must be destroyed ; and that while the Convention deeply deplores the sanc- 
tion or support still given to it, either overtly or tacitly, by so many churches 
and religious bodies, especially in the United States, it rejoice in the assurance 
that so many others are bearing their public and decided testimony against it, 
refusing to retain in their communion those who, after one admonition, per- 
sist in the justification and practice of it. 

2. That, encouraged by the progress of earnest sentiment and action on 
this subject in the churches and religious bodies of America and other coun- 
tries, this Convention repeats the testimony of the Convention of 1840 — that 
while it disclaims^he intention or desire of dictating to Christian Communi- 
ties the terms of their fellowship, respectfully submits that it is their incum- 
bent duty to separate from their communion all those persons who, after they 
have been faithfully warned, in the spirit of the gospel, continue in the sin of 
enslaving their fellow-creatures or holding them in slavery — a sin, by the 
commission of which, with whatever mitigating circumstances it may be 
attended in their own particular instance, they give the support of their 
example to the whole system of compulsory servitude, and the unutterable 
horrors of the slave trade. 

3. That this Convention, while it passes no judgment on the particular 
forms of action which different friends of the slave in different circumstances 
may adopt, hereby expresses its cordial sympathy and high admiration of all 
those who, in a Christian spirit and by Christian methods, are sincerely and 
earnestly laboring to purify their respective religious connections from all 
fellowship with and support of this heinous sin. 

Such is the verdict of anti-slavery Christendom touching the criminality 
of slavery and its utter inconsistency with a regular and approved standing 
in the Christian Church. 



EVILS OF THE DOMESTIC SLAVE TRADE. 

A SOUTHERN SCENE. 

. The following painful scene connected with the traffic in human beings is 
skelched by a correspondent of the Christian Advocate and Journal, whose 
candor and trustworthiness we have been so assured of as to induce us to 
present it as one of the many evils growing out of that cruel and unrighteous 
system. The occurrence took place at Wilmington, Del., Jan., 1844. 

There are at Washington City, at Norfolk, at Charleston, and perhaps some 
other places in the old States of the South, slave markets, where slave dealers 
purchase upon speculation such slaves as they can obtain, for the purpose of 
resale at a profit in the extreme South. ' 

" As I went on board the steamboat I noticed eight colored men, hand- 
cuffed, and chained together in pairs, four women, and eight or ten children, 
of the apparent ages of from four to ten years, all standing together in the bow 
of the boat, in charge of a man standing near them. Of the men, one was 60, 
one was 52, three of them about 30, two of them about 25, and one about 20 
years of age, as I subsequently learned from them. The two first had 
children, the next three had wives and children, and the other three were 
single, but had parents living from them. Coming near them I perceived they 
were all greatly agitated ; and, on inquiring, I found that they were all slaves, 
who had been born and raised in North Carolina, and had just been sold to a 
speculator, who was now taking them to Charleston market. Upon the shore 
there was a number of colored persons, women and children, waiting the 
departure of the boat ; and my attention was particularly attracted by two 
colored females, of uncommonly respectable appearance, neatly attired, who 
stood together, a little distance from the crowd, and upon whose countenances 
was depicted the keenest sorrow. As the last bell was toiling I saw the 
tears gushing from their eyes, and they raised their neat cotton aprons and 
wiped their faces, under the cutting anguish of severed affection. They were 
the wives of two of the men in chains. There, too, were mothers and sisters-, 
weeping at the departure of their sons and brothers ; and there, too, were 
fathers, taking the last look of their wives and children. My whole attention 
was directed to those on shore, as they seemed to st^nd in solemn, submissive 
silence, occasionally giving utterance to the intensity of their feelings by a 
sigh, or a stifled groan. As the boat was loosed from her moorings, they cast 
a distressed, lingering look towards those on board, and turned away in 
silence. My eyes now turned to those in the boat; and although I had tried 
to control my feelings, amidst my sympathies for those on shore, I could con- 
ceal them no longer, and I found myself literally ' weeping with those that 
weep.' I stood near them, and when one of the husbands saw his wife upon 
the shore wave her hand for the last time, in token of her affection, his manly 
efforts to restrain his feelings gave way, and fixing his watery eyes upon her, 
he exclaimed, ' This is the most distressing thing of all ! My dear wife and 
children, farewell !' The husband of the other wife stood weeping in silence, 
with his manacled hands raised to his face, as he looked upon her for the 
last time. Of the poor women on board, three of them had husbands, whom 
they left behind. One of them had three children, another had two, and the 
third had none. These husbands and fathers were among the throng upon 
the shore, witnessing the departure of their wives and children, and as they 
took their leave of them they were sitting together upon the floor of the boat, 
sobbing in silence, but giving utterance to no complaint. But the distressing 
scene was not yet ended. Sailing down the Cape Fear river twenty-five 
miles we touched at the little village of Smithport, on the south side of the 
river. It was at this place that one of these slaves lived, and here was his 
wife and five children ; and while at work on Monday last his purchaser took 
him away from his family, carried him in chains to Wilmington, where he 
has since remained in jail. As we approached the wharf, a flood of tears 
gushed from his eyes, and anguish seemed to have pierced his heart. The 
boat stopped but a moment, and as she left he bid farewell to some of his 
acquaintance whom he saw upon shore, exclaming, ' Boys, I wish you well ; 



tell Molly (meaning his wife) and the children I wish them well, and hope 
God will bless them.' At that moment he espied his wife on the stoop of 
a house some rods from the shore, and with one hand which was not in the 
hand-cuffs, he pulled off his old hat, and waving it towards her, exclaimed, 
' Farewell.' As ke saw, by the waving^of her apron, that she recognized 
him, he leaned back upon the railing, and In a faltering voice repeated, ' Fare- 
well, for ever.' After a moment's silence, conflicting passions seemed to tear 
open his heart, and he exclaimed, l What have I done that I should suffer this 
doom ? 0, my wife and children, I want to live no longer !' and then the big 
tear rolled down his cheek, which he wiped away with the palm of his un- 
chained hand, looked once more at the mother of his five children, and the 
turning of the boat hid her face from him for ever. As I looked around I saw 
that mine was not the only heart that had been affected by the scene, but that 
the tears standing in the eyes of many of my fellow-passengers bore testimony 
to the influence of human sympathy; and I could, as an American citizen, 
standing within the limits of one of the old thirteen States, but repeat the 
language of Mr. Jefferson, in relation to the general subject. ' I tremble when 
I think that God is just.' After v/e left Smithport I conversed freely with all 
these persons; and in intelligence, and respectability of appearance, the three 
men who have thus been torn from their families, would compare favorably 
with the respectable portion of our colored men at the North. This is a speci- 
men of what almost daily occurs in the business of the slave-trade ; and I 
hesitate not to say, that there is not a Christian in the whole South who will 
refuse to unite with his brethren everywhere in the condemnation of, and in 
the most effective measures to extinguish, the evils of this nefarious traffic. 
" Yours, in the bonds of the gospel, A. C." 

HORRORS OF SLAVERY. 

By the following, from the New Orleans Picayune, it will be seen that the 
enormities of slave bondage are not confined to the African trade, and that the 
upholder of the " patriarchal institution" of the South has no more of the milk 
of human kindness within him, than the pirate, as he is legally called, who 
severs the poor black from Ms home to be sold into slavery. The poor, bilious, 
delicate mulatto boy, whose sufferings are detailed below, who has inherited 
slavery through his mother, while, in all probability, his father is a free white 
man, and perhaps is the very wretch through whom this cruel punishment 
has been inflicted, is quite as good a subject for commiseration as is any one 
of the poor Africans who are crowded by hundreds into the narrow hold of a 
small vessel, to be transported from their native shores, and who have received 
so much diplomatic as well as merited sympathy. 

" Passing through Baronue-street about noon yesterday, a crowd, composed 
of men, women and children, attracted our attention. The object of the 
curiosity — or rather pity — we found to be a delicate, debilitated-looking 
mulatto boy, about ten years old. An old negro on one side and a stick on 
the other supported him, as he endeavored to move along, though it was evi- 
dent that any motion, however slow, was too much for his prostrate physical 
powers. 

li We inquired what was the matter with the boy, and were answered by his 
shirt being raised up off his back, and heavens! how expressive of fiendish 
cruelty was the spectacle that presented itself! The poor boy's back and 
body were one mass of raw, trembling, skinless, parti-putrid, lacerated flesh ! 
Ravines, as it were, in his carcase, had been cut by the lash, and he appeared 
altogether a victim of the most wanton and heartless cruelty which it was 
impossible for other than a fiend to inflict. All we could learn of this monstrous 
cruelty we had from the old negro who helped the poor boy along;, we give 
it for what it is worth, premising that we shall seek for the authentic facts 
of the case and lay them before the public. 

" The old negro said that he and the boy belonged to C. Donnibourg, who 
lives at the corner of Annunciation and Richard Streets ; that Donnibourg 
lost a watch, and charged the boy with stealing it. Some ten or fourteen 
days since he had him put in the police jail of the First Municipality, and 



there, by his order, says the old man, was the inhuman punishment inflicted 
on him. The boy himself says that he Teceived twenty-five lashes a-day 
from the day he was imprisoned till Thursday last. The old man, by 
direction of his master, was taking him home ; but two citizens, seeing 
that he must die by the way, informed Recorder Baldwin of his condition, 
who promptly had him brought to the police oflice, where he was examined 
by Dr. Picton. 

" As the doctor examined the wounds, they were necessarily exposed to the 
bystanders, who, by an involuntary exclamation, expressed their indignation 
against his torturer. The doctor pronounced the boy in a precarious condi- 
tion, but said that by proper treatment he might recover, and advised that he 
should be sent to the Charity Hospital. The Recorder ordered that he be at 

once taken there, and thither he was carried by the police, on a litter his 

back upward." 




THE BRANDED HAND. 
Above we give an exact representation of the brand, which was burnt with 
a hot iron, by an officer of the United States, in the living flesh of a citizen of 
Massachusetts. Ponder it, fellow-citizens, and as you burn, and blush, and 
weep, at the disgrace of our country, the indignity done to a worthy neighbor, 
and the misery of the poor slaves, let the fire burn until your soul is enkindled 
to the high resolve, that the letters on Jonathan Walker's hand shall be 
made to read — 

Salvation to the Slave. 

Not Rich, but Generous. — A correspondent of the Philadelphia Native 
American writes as follows : 

" The last time I was in Boston, passing down Hanover street, below Fleet, 
I saw a hearty son of Africa sitting on a pile of wood just sawed, and eating, 
apparently with a keen relish, some fragments of bread and meat, which had 
just been given him for his work. I should probably have passed him with- 
out further notice, had I not been struck with the appearance of a woman 
who was standing a little distance from him, and watching his operations 
with eager interest. She was a white woman, dressed in the thin garb of 
poverty, who, in spite of her emaciated and care-worn countenance, looked 
like one who had seen better days. Curious to know what interest she could 
take in his movements, I stopped a moment to watch them. 

" The wood-sawyer, noticing her fixed look, asked her what she wanted. 

" Pointing to his meal, spread upon the log, she replied, ' I have not eaten 
so much as that in two weeks.' 

" * Well, sit down here and take a bite,' said the kind-hearted negro, { although 
I aint rich, I am generous /' 

" With tears in her eyes, that seemed just before already sealed up from 



weeping, she drew near the humble table". I did not interfere to deprive the 
wood-sawyer of the pleasure of completing his generous act (for generous it 
was in him to share his only meal with another) but after privately slipping I 
a piece of money into the poor woman's hand, I continued my walk. 

THE WORKINGS OF SLAVERY. 
We find in the Green Mountain Freeman, a letter from Rev. J. C. Aspen- 
wall, who has lately visited the settlements of the runaway slaves in Canada. 
Some of his statements are curious enough and furnish a most significant 
illustration of the workings of the " peculiar institution.' 1 Among the Canada 
fugitives is Mr. Daniel Chinn, who is both brother-in-law and father-in-law 
of Hon. Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky. That is, Col. Johnson married 
Mr. Chinn's sister Julia Ann, one of his own slaves, by whom he had two 
daughters that he recognized and educated as his children. Mrs- Johnson 
died of the cholera when that disease first made its appearance in the United 
States; and respectable men from Kentucky testify that Col. Johnson has 
since lived with one of Mr. Chinn's daughters, as though she was his wife. 
This, according to common calculations, would make Mr. Chinn father-in- 
law of the venerable ex- Vice President of our great republican nation,. It 
appears that Col. Johnson took Mr. Chinn's oldest son, Marcellus, on his first 
electioneering tour for the Vice Presidency ; and that the boy left him at New 
York. Johnson tried to obtain information respecting the boy's whereabouts 
of LewisTappan, Esq., who offered to bring him forward on condition that 
his free papers should first be made out and signed. This the Colonel refused 
to do. On his second electioneering tour he took with him his body servant, 
the elder Mr. Chinn ; in whom he placed unbounded confidence. But, like 
his son, he too chose to be a man, and left Johnson at Detroit, crossed over 
into Canada, and has resided there ever since. The Col. has written him 
two letters urging him to return to his service, one of which contains some 
rather severe threats if he did not. " Ludwick Davies," one of Johnson's 
slaveholding companions, has also visited him at London, and used his best 
endeavors to persuade him to return. 

Much credit, says Mr. Aspenwall, has been given to the Col. for his generous 
conduct to this family, but his conduct in becoming the father of children by 
three women, the sisters of Mr. Chinn's wife, who is, in fact, both his brother- 
in-law and father-in-law, and then selling them all, both the women and his 
own children, to James Peak, to be carried off in slavery, as Mr. Chinn states 
that he did, may not be quite so highly commended, though in point of morality 
it is well compared with his other conduct. 

Strenuous efforts are frequently made by masters to recover their lost 
slaves, and not unfrequently are fugitives tempted, by the offer of freedom to 
themselves or their relatives, to betray their fellow-fugitives. Mr. Aspenwall 
furnishes one example of this. Mr. Chinn, the slave of Col. Johnson above 
alluded to, was written to by Mr. Newton Craig, the keeper of the Kentucky 
Penitentiary, and told that if he would betray a slave of the latter, who was 
supposed to be in Canada, his son Daniel should be set free, and Col Johnson, 
his former master, would also send him free papers for himself. The letter of 
Mr. Craig is cunningly worded and offers inducements which must have had 
great force with a man situated like Mr. Chinn, but to his honor be it recorded, 
the temptation was not too strong for his manly virtue and integrity. No 
selfish desire to secure the freedom of a darling son or to render his own situation 
more free from danger, could induce him to betray a companion in trouble. 
No man of sound principle can read the letter of Craig, knowing at the same 
time what answer was given to it by the fugitive, without feeling contempt 
for the former and admiration for the noble conduct of the latter. The slave 
was certainly most of a man. 

This system of slavery may well be called " a peculiar institution," for in its 
principles and workings it has no parallel in heaven above or in the earth 
beneath. That will be a glorious day for our country which shall witness 
its peaceful overthrow. — Tribune.
