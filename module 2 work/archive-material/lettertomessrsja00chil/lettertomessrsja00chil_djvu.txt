solitary pilgrim, who goes thitlier with soinetliing 
of the tender reverence with whii'h he would 
visit the grave of a beloved friend." 

In Snnbury, at an acaduniy, which di=:pensed 
its favors to pnpils of both sexes, Miss Mcintosh 
received all of her education for which she was 
indebted to schools ;* and there the first twenty 
years of her hfe were spent. After that time her 
hoTne having been broken up by the doath of her 
mother, she passed much of her time with a 
married sister, who resided in New York, and 
afterwards with her brother, Capt. James M. 
Mcintosh of the U. S. navy, who .e family had 
alio removed to that city. In 1885, Miss 
Mjintosh was induced to sell her property in 
Georgia, and invest the proceeds in New York. 
The investment proving injudicious, she was 
dependent on her friends or her pen. She 
characteristically chose the independence and 
intellectual development of the latter. Her first 
thought w.is to translate from the French. A 
friend advised her to attempt a juvenile series of 
publications, which shoukl take the place in moral 
Bcieiice which the popular '' Peter Parley" books 
had taken in matters of fact, and suggested 
" Aunt Kitty" as a nom de plume. The story of 
H'.ind Alice was accordingly written in 1838, but 
did not find a publisher till 1841. Its success led 
to a second, Jennie Qvahame^ whicli was followed 
in quick succession by Florence Anwtt, Grace 
aid Clara., and E'len Lsdie. Each of these 
little works was designed for the inculcation and 



• A few notes before ns, from the pen of "^ iss Mcintosh, 
OTtfiio a soav mir to the memory of this head master of 
Sli ibury. " He was an Iris'i G iiith.man — an epithet which 
h_' marked as quite distinct from that of a GmiMzman from 
Irdand. He was a graduate of the University of Antrim ; — a 
Presbyterian divine, yet not in early life after a very strict 
model. He would indeed, then, liave answered Addison's de- 
mands well, bein<; quite willing to avail himself of the elo- 
Qiencc (»f the classics of the pulpit, while he could talte a 
hand readily, either in backgammon — Sir Roger de Coverley's 
Fpeeial requisition — or in wliist. In his latter years, however, 
for he has passed away from earth, he became an earnest and 
sincere Christian minister, and might have said to many of his 
order, ' 1 was in labors more abundant' As a teacher he was 
unsurpassed. Taught in the niceties of his own language and 
oftiiedoad languages, as few American scholars of that day 
were, he seemed especially gifted for the communication of 
knowledge to others. On his first arrival in this country he 
liid resided in Alexandria, and had taught in the faini'y of 
General Washington, as he was proud uf rem.'mberiiig. Wiien 
he came to Georgia lie married ; — there he continued to live, 
and there he died at a very advanced age, nearly, if not quite, 
a hundred. Even to the last year of his life he would have de- 
tected an imperfect concord or false prosody. When he was a 
teacher, the barbarous age of the rod and tlie ferule still con- 
tinued, and the boys of his school sometimes complained that 
they were made to expiate by their application, not their own 
faults only, but also those of their fair companions, who were 
of course exempted from such punishments. To those who 
sliowed any interest in study, he was kind and indulgent. To 
myself he scarcciy otfered any constraint, permitting me often 
to choose my studies and prescribe my own lessons. The 
natural dislike of a vivacious girl to plod ever and ever in one 
beaten track, while boys, who were not always brighter than 
herself, w^re leaving her to penetrate into the higlier myste- 
ries of science, he stimulated ra her than reijressed, producing 
tliusan emulation, which gave a healthy impulse to both parties, 
I remember often to have heard Dr. McWIiir— for this was 
the name of the master — say, that this rivalry had done more 
for his school than a dozen rods, and I am quite sure tliat with 
it there mingled no bitterness, for some of those lads have 
been among the best friends of my life. The peculiar training 
of such a school must of course have exercised no small influ- 
ence on the mental characteristics. It perhaps enabled me to 
exercise more readily tlie self-reliance necessary when thrown 
on my own resources, — yet it never inclined me for a moment 
to the vagaries of those who stand forth as the ch.ampions of 
women's rights. He who best understood the nature He had 
formed, assigned to woman a position of subjection and de- 
pendence, and I consider the noblest right to be, the right 
intelligently to obey His laws. In that obedience is found, 
doubtless, the highest honor of man or womau,"

iilu-tration of some moral sentiment. In Blind 
Ahce it was the happiness springing from the 
e.vercise of benevolence; in Jessie Graliame, the 
love of truth; in Florence Arnott, the distinction 
between true generosity and its countei-feit ; in 
Grace and Clara, the value of the homely quality 
of justice; and in Ellen Leslie, the influence of 
temper on domestic happiness. In 1844, Coti- 
que^t and Self- Conquest.! and Woman an Enigma., 
were published by the Harpers. In 1845, the 
same publishers brought out Praine and Prin^ 
ciple, and a child's tule called The Gou,iins. Her 
next work. To Seem and to Be., was pubhshed in 
1846 by the Appletons, who, in 1847, republished 
Aunt Kitty's Tales, collected from the previous 
editions into a single volume. In 1818, the same 
house published Charms and Counter Charms., 
and the next year, Donaldson Manor., a collec- 
tion of articles -written at various times for 
magazines, and strung together by a slight 
thread. In 1850, was brought out Won^an i.i 
Ante, iea, the only purely didactic work the 
author has published. In 1853, appeai-ed The 
L'lfly and the Lowly, a picture of the life of the 
slave and the master, in the southern portion of 
the United States. 

In England, Miss Mcintosh's books have enjoyed 
a good reputation, with a large popular sale. They 
were first introduced by the eminent tragedian, 
Mr. Macready, who, having obtained Aunt Kitty's 
Ta es in this country to take home to his child- 
ren, read them himself on the voyage, as he 
afterwards wrote to a friend in this city, with 
such pleasure, that soon after his arrival in Lon- 
don he placed them in the hands of a publishei', 
who reproduced them there. The author's other 
books have been published in England as they 
made their appearance in America, and in the 
competition for uncopyrighted foreign literature, 
by more than one London publisher; though with 
tlio liberty of occasionally changing the name. 

THE brothers; or, in the fashion and above the 

FASHION.* 

" Some men are born to greatness — some achieve 
greatness — .and some have greatness thrust upon 
them." Henry Manning belonged to the second of 
these three great classes. The son of a mercantile 
adventurer, who won and lost a fortune by specula- 
tion, he found himself at sixteen jears of age called 
o:i to choose between the life of a Western farmer, 
with its vigorous action, stirring incident, and rough 
usage — and the life of a clerk in one of the most 
noted establishments in Broadway, the great source 
and centre of fashion in New York. Mr. Morgan, 
the brother of Mrs. Maniung, who had been recalled 
from the distant West by the death of her husband, 
and the embarrassments into which th.ut event had 
plunged her, had obtained the offer of the latter si- 
tuation for one of his two nephews, and would take 
the other with him to his prairie-home. 

" I do not ask you to go with me, Matilda," he 
said to his sister, " because our life is yet too wild 
and rough to suit a delicate woman, reared, as you 
have been, in the midst of luxurious refinements. 
The difficulties and privations of life in the "West 
fall most heavily upon woman, while she has little 
of that sustaining power which man's more adven- 
turous spirit finds in overcoming difficulty and cop- 
ing with danger. But let me have one of your

boj-s, and by tlie time he has arrived at manhood, 
he will be able, I doubt not, to offer you in his 
home all the comforts, if not all the elegances of 
your present abode." 

Mrs. Manning consented; and now the question 
■was, which of her sons should remain with her, and 
wliich should accompany Mr. Morgan. To Henry 
Manning, older by two years tlian his brother 
George, the choice of situations was submitted. 
He went with his uncle to the BrondwMy establish- 
ment, heard tlie duties which would be demanded 
from him, the salary which would be given, saw the 
grace with which the eUgants behind the counter 
displayed their silks, and' satins, and velvets, to the 
elegantes before the counter, and the decision with 
which they promulgated the decrees of fashion ; and 
wdth that just sense of his own powers wliicli is the 
accompaniment of true genius, he decided at once 
that thei'e lay his vocation. George, who liad not 
been without difficulty kept quiet while his brother 
was forming his decision, as soon as it was an- 
nounced, sprarg forward with a whoop that would 
have suited a Western forest better than a New 
York drawing-room, threw the Horace l)e was read- 
ing across the table, clasped first his mother and 
then his uncle in his arms, and exclaimed, " I am the 
boy for the West. I will help you to fell forests 
and build cities there, uncle. Why should not Ave 
build cities as well as Romulus and Remus ?" 

" I will supply your cities with all their silks, and 
satins, and velvets, and laces, and charge them no- 
thing, George," said Henry Manning with that air 
of superiority with which the worldly-wise often 
look on the sallies of the enthusiast. 

" You make my head ache, my son," complained 
Mrs. Manning, shrinking from his boisterous gratu- 
lation ; — but Mr. Morgan returned his hearty em- 
brace, and as he gazed into his bold, bright fixce, 
with an eye as bright as his own, replied to his 
burst of enthusiasm, " You are the very boy for the 
West, George. It is out of such brave stuff that 
pioneers and city -builders are always made." 

Henry Mannii g soon bowed himself into the favor 
of the ladies who formed the principal customers of 
his employer. By his careful and really correct 
habits, and his elegant taste in the selection and ar- 
rangement of goods, he became also a favorite with 
his employers themselves. Ihey needed an agent 
for the selection of goods abroad, and they sent him. 
He purchaseil cloths for them in England and silks 
in France, and came home with the reputation of a 
travelled man. Having persuaded his mother to 
advance a capital for him by selling out the bank 
stock in which Mr. Morgan liad funded lier little 
fortune, at twenty-four years of age he commenced 
business for himself as a French importer. Leaving 
a partner to attend to the sales at home, he went 
abroad for the selection of goods, and the further 
enhancement of his social reputation. He returned 
in two years with a fashionable figure, a most 
recherche stylo of dress, raoustachios of the most 
approved cut, and whiskers of faultless curl — a 
fiidshed gentleman in his own conceit. With such 
attractions, the prestige which he deiived from his 
reported travels and long residence abroad, and the 
savoir faire of one who had made the conventional 
arrangements of society his study, he quickly rose 
to the summit of his wishes, to the point which it 
had been his life's ambition to attain. He became 
the umpire of taste, and his word was received as 
the fiat of fashion. He continued to reside with his 
mother, and paid great attention to her style of 
dress, and the arrangements of her house, for it was 
important that his mother should appear properly. 
Poor Mrs. Manning! she sometimes thought that 



proud title dearly purchased by listening to nis 
daily criticisms on appearance, language, manners, 
which had been esteemed stylish enough in their 
day. 

George Manning had visited his mother only once 
since he left her with all the bright imaginings and 
boundless confidence of fourteen, and then Henry 
was in Europe. It was during the first winter after 
his return, and when the brothers had been sepa- 
rated for nearly twelve years, that Mrs. Maimir.g 
informed him she had received a letter from George, 
announcing his intention to be in New York in De- 
cember, and to remain with them through most, if 
not all the winter. Henry Mannirg was evidently 
annoyed at the announcement. 

" I wish," he said, " that George had chosen to 
make his visit in the summer, when most of the peo- 
ple to whom I should hesitate to introduce him 
w-ould have been absent. I should be sorry to hurt 
his feeliigs, but leally, to introduce a Western 

farmer into polished society " Henry Mannirg 

shuddered and was silent. " And then to choose 
this winter of all winters for his visit, and to come 
in December, just at the very time that I heard yes- 
terday Miss Harcourt was coming fi om Washii gton 
to spend a few weeks with her friend, Mrs. Duf- 
field ! " 

" And what has Miss Harcourt's visit to Mrs. 
Duffield to do with George's visit to us ?" asked Mrs. 
Manning. 

" A great deal — at least it has a great deal to do 
with my regret that he should come just now. I 
told you how I became acquainted with Emma Har- 
court in Euro])e, and what a splendid creature she 
is. Even in Paris she bore the palm for wit and 
beauty — and fashion too — that is in English and 
American society. But I did not tell you that she 
received me with such distinguished favor, and 
evinced so much pretty consciousness at my atten- 
tions, that had not her father, having been chosen 
one of the electors of President and Vice-President, 
hurried from Paris in order to be in this country in 
time for his vote, I should probably have been in- 
duced to marry her. Her father is in Congress this 
year, and j'ou see, she no sooner learns that I am 
here, than she comes to spend part of the winter 
with a friend in New York." 

Henry arose at this, walked to a glass, surveyed 
his elegant figure, and continuing to cast occasional 
glances at it as he walked backwards and forwards 
through the room, resumed the conversation, or ra- 
ther his own communication. 

"All this is very encouraging, doubtless; but 
Emma Harcourt is so perfectly elegant, sothoionghly 
r-efiued, that I dread the effect upon her of any 
outre association — by the by, mother, if I obtain her 
permission to introduce you to her, jou will not 
wear that brow"n hat in visiting her — a brown hat 
is my aversion — it is positively vulgar. But to re- 
turn to Geiuge — how can I introduce him, with his 
ix)ugh, boisterous, Western manner, to this courtly 
lady ? — the very thought chills nie" — and Henry 
Manning shivered — " and yet how can I avoid it, if 
we should be engaged ?" 

With December came the beautiful Emma Har- 
court, and Mrs. Dnffield's house was thronged with 
her admirers. Her's was the form and movement 
of the Huntress Queen rather than of one tiained 
in the halls of fashion. There was a joyous free- 
dom in her air, her step, her glance, which, had she 
been less beautiful, less talented, less fortunate in 
social position or in wealth, would have placed her 
under the ban of fa^iion ; but, as it was, she com- 
manded fashion, rnd even Henry Manning, the very 
slave of conventionalism, had no criticism for her.

MARIA J. McINTOSH 



He had been among the first to call on her, and the 
blush that flitted across her cheek, the smile that 
played upon her lips, as he was announced, might 
well have flattered one evei\ of less vanity. 

The very next day, before Henry had had time to 
improve these symptoms of lier favor, on returning 
home, at five o'clock to his dinner, he found a 
stranger in the parlor with his mother.. The gentle- 
man arose on his entrance, and he had scarcely time 
to glance at the tall, manly form, the lofty air, the 
commanding brow, ere he found himself clasped in 
his arms, with the exclamation, " Dear Henry ! how 
rejoiced I am to see you again." 

In George Manning the physical and intellectual 
man had baen developed in rare harmony. He was 
taller and larger every way than his brother Henry, 
and the self-reliance which the latter had labori- 
ously attained from the mastery of all conventional 
rules, was his by virtue of a courageous soul, which 
held itself above all rules but those prescribed by 
its own high sense of the right. There was a sin- 
gular contrast, rendered yet more striking by some 
points of resemblance, between the pupil of society 
and the child of the forest — between the Parisian 
elegance of Henry, and the proud, free grace of 
George. His were the step and bearing which we 
have seen in an Indian chief ; but thought had left 
its impress on his brow, and there was in his. coun- 
tenance that indescribable air of refinement which 
marks a polished mind. In a very few minutes 
Henry became reconciled to his brother's arrival, 
and satisfied with him in all respects but one— .liis 
dress. This was of the finest cloth, but made into 
large, loose trowsers, and a species of hu iting-shirt, 
trimmed with fur, belted around the waist, and de- 
scending to the knee, instead of the tight pantaloons 
and closely fitting body coat prescribed by fashion.. 
The little party lingered long over the table — -it was 
seven o'clock before they arose from it. 

" Dear mother," said George Manning, " I am 
sorry to leave you this evening, but I will make you 
rich amends to-morrow by introducing to you the 
friend I am going to visit, if you will permit ma 
Henry, it is so Jong since I was in New York that I 
need some direction in finding my way — must I turn 
up or down Broadway for Number — , in going from 
this street ?" 

" Number — ," exclaimed Henry in surprise ; 
" you must be mistaken — that is Mrs. Dufiield's." 

" Then I am quite right ; for it is at Mrs. Duf- 
field's that I expect to meet my friend this evening." 

AVith some curiosity to know what friend of 
George could have so completely the entree of the 
fashionable Mrs. Duffield's house as to make an ap- 
pointment there, Henry proposed to go with him 
and show him the way. There was a momentary 
hesitation in George's manner before he replied ; 
" Very well, I shall be obliged to you." 

"But — excuse me, George — you are not surely 
going in that dress — this is one of Mrs. Duffield's re- 
ception evenings, and, early as it is, you will find 
company there." 

George laughed as he replied j^" They must take 
me as I am, Henry. We do not i-eceive our fashions 
from Paris at the West." 

Henry almost repented his offer to accompany his 
brother, but it was too late to withdraw; for 
George, unconscious of this feeling, had taken his 
cloak and cap, and was awaiting his escort. As 
they approached Mrs. Duffield's house, George, who 
had hitiierto led the conversation, became silent, or 
answered his brother only in monosyllables, and 
then not always to tie purpose. As they entered 
the hall, the hats and clnaks displayed there showed 
that, as Henry supposed, they were not the earliest 



visitors. George prinseS for a moment, and sai 1, 
" You must go in witliont me, Henrj'. Shov/ me to 
a room wliere there is no company," he continued, 
turtdng to a servant — " a.,d take this card in to Mrs. 
Duffield — be sure to give it to Mrs. Duffield her- 
self." 

The servant bowed low to the commanding 
stranger; and Henry, almost mechanically, obeyed 
his direction, muttering to himself, " Free and easy, 
upon my honor." He had scarcely entered the usual 
reception-room, and made his bow to Mrs. Duffield, 
when the servant presented his brother's card. He 
watched her closely, and saw a smile playing over 
her lips as her eyes rested on it. Slie glanced 
anxiously at Miss Harcourt, and crossing the room 
to a group in which she stood, she drew her aside. 
After a few whispered words, Mrs. Duffield placed 
the card in Miss Harcourt's hand. A sudden flash 
of joy irradiated, every feature of her beautiful 
face, and Henry Manning saw that, but for Mrs. 
Duffield's restraining hand, she would have rushed 
from the room. Recalled thus to a re3ollection of 
others, she looked around her, and her eyes met his. 
In an instant her face was covered with blushes, and 
she drew back with embarrassed consciousness — al- 
most immediately, however, she raised her hea 1 
with a proud, bright expression, and though she did 
not look at Henry Manning, he felt that she was 
conscious of his observation, as she passed with a 
composed yet joyous step from the room. 

Henry Manning was awaking from a dream. It 
was not a very pleasant awakening ; but as his vanity 
rather than his heart was touched, he was able to 
conceal his chagrin, and appear as interesting and 
agreeable as usual. He now expected, with some 
impatience, the denouement of the comely. An 
hour passed away, and Mrs. Duffield's eye began to 
consult the marble clock on her mantel-piece. The 
ehiiae for another half hour rang out ; and she left 
the room and returned in a few minutes, leaning on 
the arm of George Manning. 

" Who is that? — What noble-looking man 13 
that ?" were questions Henry Manning heard from 
many — from a very few only the exclamation, " How 
oddly he is dressed !" Before the evening was over 
Henry began to feel that he was eclipsed on his own 
theatre — that George, if not in the fashion, was yet 
more the fashion than he. 

Following the proud happy glance of his brother's 
eye, a quarter of an hour later, Henry saw Miss 
Harcourt entering the room in an opposite direction 
from that in which he had lately come. If this 
were a ruse on her part to veil the connexion be- 
tween their movements, it was a fruitless caution. 
None who had seen her before could fail now to ob- 
serve the softened character of her beauty, and 
those who saw 

A thousand blushing apparitions start 
Into her face — 

whenever his ej'es rested on her, could scarcely 
doubt his influence over her^ 

The next morning George Manning brought Miss 
Harcourt to visit his mother;, and Mrs. Maiming rose 
greatly in her son Henry's estimation when he saw 
the affectionate deference evinced towards her by 
the proud beauty.. 

" How strange my manner must have seemed to 
you sometimes !" said Miss Harcourt to Henry one 
day. " I was engaged to George long before I met 
you in Europe; and though I never had courage to 
mention him to you, I wondered a little that you 
never spoke of him. I never doubted for a moment 
that you were acquainted with our engagement." 

" I do not even yet understand where and how 
you and George metj'

CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN LITERATURE. 



" "We met at home — my father was governor of 
the territory — State now — in which your unele 
lives ; our homes were very near each other's, and 
BO we met almost daily while I was still a child. 
We have had all sorts of adventures together ; for 
George was a great favorite with my father, and I 
was |)ermitted to go with him anywhere. He has 
Saved my life twice — once at the imminent peril of 
his own, when with the wilfulness of a spoiled 
child I would ride a horse which he told me I could 
not manage. Oh ! you know not half his noble- 
ness," a;id tears moistened the bright eyes of the 
happy girl. 

He.;ry Manning was touched through all his con- 
ventionalism, yet the moment after he said, " Ge:)rge 
is a fine fellow, certainly ; but I wish you could 
persuade him to dress a little more like otlier 
people." 

" I would not if I could," exclaimed Emma Har- 
court, while the blood rushed to her temples ; " fa- 
shions and all such eonve:itional regulations are 
male for those who have no innate perception of 
the right, the noble, the beautiful — not for such as 
he — he is above fashion." 

What Emma would not ask, she yet did not fail 
to recognise as another proof of correct judgment, 
when George Manning laid aside his Western cos- 
tume and assumed one less remarkable. 

Henry Maiming had received a new idea — thnt 
there are those who are above the fashion. Allied 
to this was another thoug!it, which in time found 
e.itrance to his mind, that it would be at least as 
profitable to devote our energies to the acquisition 
of true nobility of soul, pure and high thought and 
refined taste, as to the study of those conventional- 
isms which are but their outer garment, and can at 
best only conceal, for a short time, their absence. 

LTDIA MAEIA CHILD. 

TnE maiden iia;iie of Mrs. Child was Francis. 
She was born in Massachusetts, but passed a por- 
tion of her earlier career in Maine, where her fa- 
ther removed shortly after her birth. 

In the year 1824 she published her first work, 
Eohomoh, a tale founded upon the early history 
of New England. The story told by Dr. Gris- 
vvold in relation to this commencement of a long 
literary career is a curious one. While on a visit 
to her brother, the Rev. Convers Francis, minis- 
ter in Watertown, Massachusetts, she accidentally 
met with the recent number of the Forth Ame- 
rican Keview and read an article on Yamoyden by 
Dr. Palfrey, in which the field offered, by early 
New England history for the purposes of the no- 
velist is dwelt upon. She took pen in hand and 
wrote oflF the first chapter of Hobomok. Her 
brother's connnendation encouraged her to pro- 
ceed, and in shx; weeks the story Avas completed. 
In the following year she published The Eebeln^ a 
tale of the Kevolution. Like Hobomok it intro- 
duces the most prominent historical personages of 
its scene and time to the reader, and with such 
eifect that a speech put in the mouth of James 
Otis is often quoted as having been actually pro- 
n )uno3d by the statesman.

In 1826 she marned Mr. David L. Child, and 
in 1827 oonnnenced The Juvenile Miaiellany^ a

gal Housewife, a work on domestic economy and 
culinary matters, designed for families of limited 
means. In 1831 she published The Mother's 
Booh, a volume of good counsel on the training of. 
children, and in 1882 The OirFs Book, a work of 
somewhat similar nature. Her Lires of Madame 
de Stael, Madame Roland, Lady Busxell, and Ma- 
dame Guyon, were published about the same time 
in two volumes of the Ladies' Family Library, a 
serie * of books edited by her, for which she also 
prepared the BiograpMex of Good Wives, in one 
volume, and the History of the Condition of 
Women in all Aget, in two volumes. 

In 1883 she published The Coronal, a collection 
of miscellanies in prose and verse, which she had 
previously contributed to various anmuils, and in 
the same year An Appeal for that Class ofAine- 
i-ioans callel Africans, a vigorous work which 
created a great sensation. Dr. Channing is said 
to have walked from Boston to Ro.xbury to see 
and thank the author, pers. naUy a stranger to 
him. 

In 1835, Philothea, a classical romance of the 
days of Pericles and Aspasia, a;)peared. It is the 
most elaborate and successful of the author's pro- 
ductions, and is in close and artistic keeping with 
the classic age it portrays. Most of the statesmen 
and philosophers of the time are introduced in its 
pages \vith a generally close adherence to history, 
though in the character of Plato she has departed 
in a measure from this rule by dwelling on the 
mystical doctrines of the philosopher to the ex- 
clusion of liis practical traits of character. The 
female characters, Philothea, Eudora, and the ce- 
lebrated Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty 
and delicacy. 

In 1841 Mri. Child and her husband, removing 
to New York, became the editors of the National 
Anti-Slavery Standard, In the same j'ear she 
commenced a series of letters for the Boston Cou- 
rier, which were afterwards republished in two 
volumes with the title of Letters from. New York, 
a pleasant series of descriptions of the every-day 
life of the metropolis, abounding to the observant 
and appreciative eye in picturesque incident and 
suggestion for far-reaching thought. M'Donald 
Clarke forms the subject of one of those letters. 
Others are occupied by the humanitarian institu- 
tions of the city, others by flowers and markets. 
The peripatetic trades come in for their share of 
notice, nor are the pathetic narratives of want, 
temptation, and misery, the aimals of the cellar 
and garret, omitted. Occasional excursions to 
the picturesque and historic villages of the Hud- 
son, Staten Lland, and other near at hand rural 
i-etreat.^, give an additional charm to these de- 
lightful volumes. 

In 1846 Mrs. Child published a collection of her 
magazine stories under the title of Fact and Fic- 
tion. She has now in press a work in three vo- 
lumes, one of the most elaborate which she has 
imdertaken, entitled The Progress of Religious 
Ideas, embracing a view of every form of belief 
"from the most ancient Hindoo records to the 
complete establishment of the Catholic Church."
