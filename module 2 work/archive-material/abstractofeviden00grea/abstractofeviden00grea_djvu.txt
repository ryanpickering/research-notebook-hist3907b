PREFACE, 



IN confequence of the numerous Petitions which 
were fent to Parliament from different Counties, 
Cities, and Towns of Great Britain, in the year 1788, 
for the ABOTJTION of the SLAVE-TRADE, it 
was determined by the Houfe of Commons to hear 
Evidence upon that fubje^l. 

The Slave-Merchants and Planters accordingly 
brought forward feveral perfons as witnefTes, the firft 
in behalf of the continuance of Slave-trade, the latter 
in defence of the Colonial Slavery. Thefe were heard 
and examined in the years 1789 and 1790. 

Several perfons were afterwards called on the fide of 
the petitioners of Great Britain, to fubftantiate the 
foundation of their feveral petitions, and to invalidate 
feveral points of the evidence which the others had 
offered. Thefe were examined in the years 1790, 

and 1791.

IV PREFACE. 

This Abftract then is made up from the evidence o£ 
the latter, in which little other alteration has been made 
than that of bringing things on the fame point into one 
chapter, which before lay fcattered in different parts of 
the evidence; and this has been done to enable the 
reader to fee every branch of the fubjedl in a clear and 
diftin^ fhape. 

The evidence for Africa and the Middle Paflage, on 
the fide of the Petitioners of Great Britain, is given by 
perfons, who have been to almofi: all the confpicuous 
parts of Africa, from the River Senegal to Angola. 
Many of them have had great opportunities of infor- 
mation, from having been refident on fhore, or having 
been up and down the different rivers, or from having 
made each of them feveral voyages. Among thefe, as 
well as among thofe who have only had the opportunity 
perhaps of a fmgle voyage, are to be reckoned feveral 
refpedlable perfons of education, obfervation, and lelfure, 
and it is to be obferved, that the information of the 
whole goes to things at different periods from the year 
1754 to 1789. The evidences again for the Welt 
Indies and America are numerous and refpedtable. 
Many of them have had the advantage of being refident 
there for years, and the information which they hav6 
given, extends to thing-s as they were at various times 
from 1753 to 1790, Of all thefe it muft be faid, that 
they are totally dlfmterejied perfons^ and therefore can 
have had nothing to biafs them either one way or the 
©ther in the evidence they have given. The editor, on 

ths 




PREFACE.' V 

the other handj feels it incumbent upon him to acknow- 
ledge, that feme of them came up as evidences^ from a 
fe?2fe of duty^ and this againji' their own apparent inter ef^ 
and under the threats and profpe^ of juffer'ing confiderahh 
for fuch a condud. 

Of the Evidences, on the other hand, brought for- 
ward by the llave-merch ants alKl' planters, there are fei^ 
indeed who are not deeply interefied in>th6 leilimony they 
have given, and the event of the decifion. 'M'the African 
part of the queftion, all but two are immedi'^t 
cerned in the flave-trade, and in the Weil-InSi»fj;-"the 
Admirals only can be fairly excepted. And of what 
does their information confrft but of round and general 
afTertions, without any fpecifick fa£ts ? Thefe aiTertions, 
however, are in behalf of the planters, and tend t© 
prove the comforts and happinefs of their Haves. 

We have no right to fuppofe that perfons of their 
chara6^er had any intention of mifleading the publick in 
a queflion of fo much importance to the interefls of 
mankind ; but we may fuppofe, that in their fituation 
they had little or no opportunity of ohferving the treatment 
eftheflaves'y and this is actually the fa6l. The Admirals, 
when on fhore, were almoft entirely in the towns. Now 
all the evidences for the petitioners of England are una- 
nimous in afTerting that the (laves in the towns appear 
to be better treated than thofe in the country. Hence 
the Admirals may have been in fome meafure warranted 
in faying what they have done, but they ought to have 

obferved. 



^ PREFACE, 

obferved that their evidence related to but a partial and 
not the general body of the Jlavesy and that their opportu^ 
nities of information were exceedingly limited and confined^ 

When, however, they went into ^e country, thei^ 
fituation again precluded them from getting the fame in^ 
formation as other men. Mr. H. Rofs, examined among 
others, fays that as to the information w^hich may have 
been gotten by thofe holding high commands in the 
Weft Indies, he cannot fpeak decidedly ; but if it be 
meant to know whether fuch, on occafional vifits to 
eftates, were likely to obtain a thorough knowledge of 
the treatment of flaves, he thinks they could not. He has 
cften accompanied Governors and Admirals m their 
tours there. The eftates vifited, belonging to perfons 
of diftin6tion, might be fuppofed under the befi manage- 
ment, Befides all pojjible care would be taken to keep 
ivery difgufling ob]e£l from view^ and on no account by the 
ex€rcife of the whip or other puniflimentSj to harrow up 
the feelings of perfons of fuch diJlinSliGn^ 

The above accounts fhew that the rank dndfituatian 
©f the Admirals precluded them from feeing as much as 
others, or in other words, that their opportunities of in-^ 
formation were not as great as thofe of other men. Many 
other circumftances may be cited to prove the fame 
thing. Among thefe are the preambles and claufes of 
certain laws, and extra£ls from the Weft Indian publick 
prints. To begin with the former,

In the Jamaica paper, called the Gazette of St. Jago 
de la Vega, dated Odober ii, 1787, we number 97 
runaway flaves advertifed, viz. 45 " branded" and 52^ 
without " brands." Among the former is " William 
" marked on the right fhoulder R A, heart and dia- 
'' rnond between, and on the left R A, heart at top," 
alfo " Batty on both fhoulders H P in one," and 
" Guy marked, on the right fhoulder W D, and on 
*' the left I H." — In the fame Gazette, dated Novem- 
ber 8th, 1787, there are notified 23 runaways marked, 
and 44 unmarked. Among thofe marked is " Apollo 
" W S, on his face and breaft," — Robert R P on each 
'' cheek, and Kingfton marked YORKE on each 
" fhoulder and breafls." — We find, in the Cornwall 
Chronicle, of Jamaica, dated December 15, 177B, 
^' 84 runaways advertifed 13 of whom only are brand- 
'* ed." Among thefe are " Pompey, a creole negro man, 
" marked on both fhoulders and breafls M L, diamond

" cheeks," and Billy belonging to the King, marked 
*' broad arrow, on the flioulder." — ^In the Kingfloa

1789, we find again, feven runaways from one pro^ 
prietor, viz. « an old woman with her two fons and 
two daughters, one of them very big with child," 
alfo a field negro and a carpenter. In the fupple- 
menttothe Cornwall Chronicle of Nov. 7, 1789, there 
are 135 runaways advertifed, viz. 48 with, and 87 
without brands. Of the former fome have two, three, 
and four brands on the face, hreajis, and jhoulders. 
One in particular is " marked D E on both cheeks and

«c woman with a wooden leg." One man is diftin» 
guiftied by having « both ears crop^ and another by

Daily Advertifer of Feb. ii, 1791, we find fix run^^ 
aways advertifed by one owner, viz. two men and four 
women, befides a girl child of one of the latter. Both 
the men and two of the women are of one family, be» 
ing an old woman, her brother, her fon, and her 
grand nephew (marked RDC) and who abfented 
themfelves at different times.— An advertifement in the 
Jamaica Daily Advertifer of Feb. 24, 1791, begins 
thus :— " Feb. 22, 1791, Efcaped on Sunday laft with

The claufes, preambles, and advertifernents juft cited 
will, it is prefumed, without any farther extracts, bring 
additional convi6tion to the mind of the reader, that 
the Admirals could have known little or nothing about 
the treatment of the /laves during their refidence in the 
iflands : for they fhew, firft, that the fiaves have been 
infufficiently fed, lodged, and clothed ; that they have 
been under the power of the mader and overfeer to an 
unreafonable degree ; that they have been often turned 
adrift, when incapable of labour, " to beg, fteal, or ftarve ;'^ 
that their ears and nofes have been flit and cut oiF; 
that they have oeen alfo otherwife disfigured as well as 
deprived of limbs and members ; that they have been 
fuddenly murdered anc buried ; and that in fome cafes 
where they have run away, rewards have been offered toi 
indifferent perfons to bring them to their owners alive or 
dead. They fhew^ fecondly, that thefe different cir« 
cumllances have happened^ and that many of them

Miuft have been notorious (or why were laws introduced 
by the coloniftsthemfelves for their prevention? )/«f^/^^ 
year 1783, for the dates of the feveral a^Sts or adver- 
vertifements are in 1784, 1785, 1787, 1788, 1789, 
and 1 791. But if they n^?:ft have been notorious fince 
the year 1783, it is clear (the treatment of the flaves 
having improved though not kept pace with the im- 
provement of the age) that they mufl have been equally no-- 
torlous previous to the year 1783, that is to fay, at the very 
time the Admirals were in the difFerent iflands with 
their refpe61:ive fleets. Now the Admirals are as fir 
lent about thefe notorious fads in their evidence, 
as if they had never exifted at all. If they knew them 
and concealed them (which we cannot believe) 
their evidence is unworthy of refpeil upon this occa- 
fion; and if they did not know them, it only con- 
firms what has been faid before, that they had not the 
fame opportunities as other men^ and that they were 
therefore incompetent as evidences upon fo great a 
queftion. 

The Admirals again have fhewn themfelves egregi- 
oufly ignorant of a mofl notorious law^ a law too, which 
pxifts at the prefent day, namely, " that the evidence 
of a flave is not valid againil any white man." Had 
they been acquainted with this, they would have per- 
ceived inftantly that it was in any malt ,r's power to 
* torture or even murder his Have with impunity, and

this in the fight of a thoufand black fpe£lators, provided 
he only took care that no white perfon beheld him. 
Had they known this, they would have perceived the 
unprote6led ftate of the flaves, and would never have 
ipoken as they have. It is impoilible therefore that 
they could have become acquainted with this law, and 
this only brings us to the fame conclufion as before, viz. 
their incapacity as evidences on thejuhje5l of the treatment 
&f theJJaves, 

Before the Preface is clofed, it may be neceflary to 
anticipate, that fome one may afk the Editor, why he 
has given in this Abftra6i: the Evidence on the part of 
the Petitioners only, and omitted that which has been 
adduced on the other fide. To this the Editor might 
reply, that it is the bufinefs of the Slave-merchants and 
Planters, if they think their cafe defenhble by the 
evidence they have produced, to do it, but he would 
rather wifli to reply, that it is unnecessary; for 
admitting the witnefFes on the part of the Slave-mer- 
chants and Planters never to have feen among them all 
even one fingle instance of enormity., either in Africa, or 
on the Middle Paffage, or in the Weft Indies, (which 
none of them will pretend to aflert) this negative evidence 
can make nothing againft the numberlefs pfitive and 

erreltles, he Is not to Imagine that the mafter cannot do them now as 
heretofore; for it Is clear, that while a flave's evidence is not ad. 
n^iffible againft a white man, he may do them with impunity at the 
pvefent day.

He has often heard of villages, and (qqu. the remains 
of fach, broken up by making the people Haves. 

That the Moors ufed to crofs the Senegal to catch the 
negroes w?.?, fpoken of at. Fort Louis as notorious ; and 
he has k<cn inilances of it where the perfons fo taken 
were ranfom.ed. 

General P.ooke fays, that kidnapping took place in the 
neighbourhood of Goree. It was fpoken of as a com- 
mon pra6tice. It was reckoned difgraceful there, but he 
cannot fpeak of the opinion about it on the Continent. 
He remembers two or three inftances of negroes 'being 
brought to Goree, who had been kidnapped, but he could 
not difcover by whom. At their own requeil he imme- 
diately feat them back. 

A Mr. Dalrymple 



( 2 ) 

Mamiey of Mr. Dalrymplc found that the great droves (called 

sfaveffrom CafFellas or Caravans) of flaves brought from inland, 

the Riicr by way of Galam, to Senegal and Gambia, v/ere pri- 

Semgal to foncrs of War. Thofe fold to veflels at Goree, and near 

%'ambir ^^' ^^"^^ procured either by the grand pillage, the lelTer 

pillage, or by robbery of individuals, or in confequence 

of crimes. The grand pillage is executed by the king's 

foldiers, from three hundred to three thoufand at a time, 

who attack and fet fire to a village, and feize the inha bitants 

as they can. The fmaller parties generally lie in wait 

about the vill?-ges, and take off all they can furprife ; 

which is alfo done by individuals, who do not belong to 

the king, but are private robbers. Thefe fell their prey 

on the coafl, where it is well known no queftions as to 

the means of obtaining it are afked. 

As to kidnapping it is fo notorious about Goree, that 
he never heard any perfon deny it there. Two men 
while he v^^as there oftered a perfon, a mefienger from 
Senegal to Runfco, for fale, to the garrifon, v/ho even 
boailed how they had obtained him. Many alfo v/ere 
brought to Goree while he was there, procured in the 
fame manner. 

Thefe depredations are alfo praflifed by the Moors : 
he faw many fiaves in Africa who told him they were 
taken by them ; particularly three, one of whom was a 
woman, who cried very much, and feemed to be in great 
diftrefs 3 the two others were more reconciled to their fate. 

Captain Wilfon fays, that flaves are either procured 
by inteftine wars, or kings breaking up villages, or 
crimes real or imputed, or kidnapping* 

Villages are broken up by the king's troops furround- 
Ing them in the night, and feizing fuch of the inhabi- 
tants as fuit their purpofe. This practice is moft com- 
mon when there is no war with another ftate. 

It is univerfally acknowledged that free perfons are fold 
for real or impute d crimes, /ir the henefd of their judges. 

Soon after his arrival at Goree, king Darnel fent 
a free man t? him for fale, and was to have the price 
himfelf. One of the king's guards being afked whether 
the man was guilty of the crime imputed to him, 

anfwered,

anfwerec!, that vjas of no confequence^ or ever inquired ^^^^'^^^ °f 
into. Captain Wilfon returned the man. 'stvSfrom 

Kidnapping was acknowledged by all he converfed the River 
with to be generally prevalent. It is the firft principle ■^"-^.^'f^^'' 
of the natives, the principle of felf-prefervation, never ^Q^lJal 
to go un-.irmed^ while a fla'ue vejjel is on the coafl, for 
fear of being ftolen. When he has met them thus 
armed, and inquired of them, through his interpreter, 
the reafon of it, they have pointed to ?. French flave- 
veflel then lying at Portudal, and faid their fears arofe 
from that quarter. As a pofitive inftance, he fays, a 
courier of Captain Lacy's, his predecelTor, though a 
Moor, a free man, and one who fpoke the French 
language fluently, was kidnapped as he was travelling on 
the Continent with difpatches on his Britannick Majefly's 
account, and fold to a French vefiel, from which he. 
Captain Wilfon, after much trouble, actually got him 
back. 

When he prefided in a court at Goree, a Maraboo. 
fwore, with an energy which evinced the truth of his 
evidence, that his brother, another Maraboo, had been 
kidnapped in the a6l of drinking, a moment known to be 
f acred by their religion, at the inftigation of a former 
governor, who had taken a diflike to him. This was a 
matter notorious at Goree* 

Mr. Wadflrom knows Haves to be procured betweea 
Senegal and Gambia, either by the general pillage or by- 
robbery by individuals, or by ftratagem and deceit. 

The general pillage is executed by the king's troops 
on horfeback, armed, who feize the unprepared. Mr* 
Wadftroin, during the week he was at Joal, accompa- 
nying one of thofe embaflies which the French governor 
fends yearly v/ith prefents to the black kings, to keep up 
the Have trade, faw parties fent out for this purpofe^ by 
king Barbefin, almoft every day, Thefe parties went 
out generally in the eve-ding^ and were armed with bows 
and arrows, guns, piftols, fab res, and long lances. 

The king of Sallum pra6lifes the pillage alfo. Mr^ 
Wadftrom faw twenty -feven flaves from Sallum, twenty- 
three of whom were women and children, thus taken.

^fanf:n' of He was told slfo by merchants at Goree, that king 
makmg Damel pra6lifes the pillage in like manner. 
thTRiver"^ Robbery was a general way of taking fingle {laves. He 
Senegal io oncc faw a woman and a boy in the flave-hold at (joree ; 
the latter had been taken by ftealth from his parents in 
the interior parts above Cape Rouge, and he declared, that 
fuch robberies were very frequent in his country ; the 
former, at Rufifco, from her hufband and children. He 
could ik^tQ fevei al injiance^ of Aich robberies. He very 
often favv^ negroes thus taken brought to Goree. Ganna 
of Dacard was a noted man-Jiealer^ and employed as 
fuch by the flave merchants there. 

As inftanc^s of ftratagem employed to obtain ilaves, 
he relates, that a l rench merchant taking a fancy to a 
negro, who v.^as on a vifit at Dacard, perfuaded the 
village, for a c,ertain price, to feize him. He v/as accord- 
ingly taken from his v^^ife, who wiflied to accompany 
him, but the Frenchman had not merchandize enough to 
buy both. Mr. Wadfirom faw this negro at Goree, 
the day he arrived from Dacard, chained, and lying on 
the ground, exceedingly diftrelTed in his mind. 

The king of Sallum alfo prevailed on a woman to 
com^e into his kingdom, and fell him fome millet. On 
her arrival, he feized and fold her to a French officer, 
with whom Mr. Wadfcrom faw this woman every day 
■while at Goree. 

Mr. Wadftrom v/as on the ifiand of St. Louis, up 
the Senegal alfo, and on the continent near the river, and 
fays, that all the Haves fold at Senegal, are brought down 
the river, except thofe taken by the robbery of the Moors 
in the neighbourhood, v/hich is fometimes conducted by 
large parties, in v/hat are called petty %vars. 

Captain Hills faw while lying betv/een Goree and the 
continent, the natives, in an evening, often go out in 
war dreffes, as he found to obtain Jlav 3 s for king Damel, 
to be fold. The reafon v/as, that the king vjas then 
foor^ not having received his ufual dues from us. He 
never faw the parties that went out return v/ith Haves, 
but has often feen flaves in their huts tied back to back. 
He remembers alfo, that fome robbers once brought him 

a man 



( 5 ) 

a man bound on board the Zephlr, to fell, but he, Capt. Mj.nner of 
Hills, would not buy him, but fufFered him to efcape. 'stvifrom

carrying bafkets ofihallqts, and af^ed Capt- Hills if they 
would do^~ in which cafe he would take them eff^ and bring 
them to him. This he declined. From the eafe v/ith 
v/hich the pilot did it, he concludes this v/as cuftomary. 

The black pilot faid the merchant?nen would not refufe 
fuch an offer. He apprehends thefe two boys wqvq free 
people^ from the pilot's mode of fpe aking, and from his 
winking, implying, it was an illicit thing. 

A boy, v/hom he bought from the merchants in the 
fame river, had been carried in the night from his father's 
houfe, v.'here a ildrmiih had happened, in which he believes 
he faid both his parents, but he 'vell remembers, one were 
killed. The boy faid many were killed, and fome taken. 

Mr Ellifon fpoke the Mundingo language, in confe- 
quence of which he has often converfed v/ith Haves from 
the Gambia, to v/hich river he made three voyages, and 
they univerfally informed him, that they had h^Qn /foleiz 
and fold. 

The natives up the river ScafTus informed Mr. Bow- Manner of 
man, that they had got two v/omen and a girl, whom '^'^^'^'■"Z 
they then brought him, in a fmall town which they \^2.^ tUKiver^ 
furprized in the night ; that others had got off, but they Gambia to

traded with formerly ; upon queftioning them, he difco- 
vered the women he had bought to be their wives. Both 
men and women informed him, that the war-men had 
taken them while ajlcefj. 

The war-men ufed to go out, Mr. Bowman fays, once 
or twice in eight or ten days, while he v/as at Scaffus. 
It was their conftant way of getting flaves, he believed, 

becaufe

Gambia to fuppHed, they blew the horn, made the war cry, and fet 
\hcWmd- ^'^' ^f t^sy "^^t with no flaves, they v/ould bring him 
ni:ard Cncjl. fome ivory and camwood. Sometimes he accompanied 
them a mile or fo, and once joined the party, anxious to 
know by what means they obtained the flaves. Having 
travelled all day, they came to a fmall river, when he 
was told they had but a little v/ay farther to go. Hav- 
ing crofTed the river, they flopped till dark. Here Mr. 
Bowman (it was about the middle of the night) was afraid 
to go farther, and pi-evailed on the king's fon to leave 
him a guard of four men. In half an hour he heard the 
war cry, by which he underftood they had reached a 
town. In about half an hour more they returned, bring- 
ing from twenty-five to thirty men, women and child- 
ren, fome at the breaft. At this time he faw the town 
m ftam.es. When they had re-crofTed the river, it was 
jufi day light, and they reached ScafTus about mid-day. 
The prifoners were carried to different parts of the 
town. They are ufually brought in with firings around 
their necks, and fome have their hands tied acrofs. He 
never faw any flaves there who had been convi6led of 
crimes. 

He has been called up in the night to fee fires-y and 
told by the tov/ns people that it was war carrying on. 

Whatever rivers he has traded in, fuch as Sierra Leon, 
Junk, and little Cape Mount, he has ufually pafTed burnt 
and deferted villages, and learned from the natives in the 
boat with him, that war had been there^ and the natives 
had been taken in the manner as before defer ibed^ and car- 
ried to the f/)ips. 

He has alfo feen fuch upon the Coaft : while trading 
at Grand BafTau, he went on fhore with four black 
traders to the town a mile off. In the way, there was 
a town deferted, (with only two or three houfes flanding) 
which feemed to have been a large one, as there were 
two fine plantations of rice ready for cutting down. A 
little further on they came to another village in much 
the fame frate, Ke was told the firll town had been 

taken 



( 7 ) 

taken by war, there being many JJj'ips then lying at Bajfau : Manner rf 
the people of the other had moved hi2;her up in the ^'f"^'"<? 
country for fear of the white men^ In palling along to the River 
the trader's tov/n he faw feveral villages deferted j thefe Ga^tbia to 
the natives faid had been defrayed by zvar^ and the people J^^ ^%^j[ 
taken out and fold, •wardCcaji, 

Sir George Young found flaves to be procured by v^^ar, 
by crimes, real or imputed^ by kidnapping, v^hich is 
called p^Jiyaring^ and a fourth mode was the inhabitants 
of one village feizing thofe of another weaker village, 
and felling them to the fhips. 

He believes, from two inftances, that kidnapping was 
frequently pra<51:ifed up Sierra Leon River. One was 
that of a beautiful infant boy, which the natives after 
trying to fell to all the different trading ihips came along 
fide his, (the Phoenix) and threatened to tofs overboard, 
if no one would buy it ; faying they had panyared it witli 
many other people, but could not fell it, though they 
had fold the others. He purchafed it for feme v/ine. 

The fecond v/as, a captain of a Liverpool ihip had 
got, as a temporary miftrefs, a girl from the king of 
bierra Leon, and inftead of returning her on fhore on 
leaving the coaft, as is ufually done, he took her away 
with him. Of this the king complained to Sir George 
Young very heavily, calling this action panyarmg by the 
whites. 

The term, panyarmg^ feemed to be a word generally 
ufed all along the coaft where he was, not only among 
the Englifh. but the Portuguefe and Dutch. 

Capt. Thompfon alfo fays, that at Sierra Leon he has 
often heard the word panyarmg ; he has heard alfo that 
this word, which is ufed on other parts of the coaft, 
means kidnappings or feizing of men. 

Slaves, fays Mr. Town, are brought from the coun- 
try very diftant from the coaft. The king of Earra 
informed Mr. Town, that on the arrival of a fhip, he 
has gone three hundred miles up the country with his 
guards^ and driven down captives to the fea^fide. From

fv/ered. Mr. Tov/n has feen the prifoners (the men 
bound, the women and children loofe) driven for fale to 
the water-fide. He has alfo known the natives go in gangs 
marauding and catching all they could. In the Galenas 
Ps.iver he knew four blacks feize a man who had been to 
the fea-fide to fell one or more Haves. This man was 
returning home with the goods received in exchange for 
thefe, and they plundered and ftripped him naked, and 
brought him to the trading Ihallop, which Mr. Town 
commanded, and fold him there. 

He believes the natives alfo fometimes become flaves, 
in confequence of crimes, as well as, that it is no un- 
common thing on the coaft, to impute crimes falfely for the 
Jake of felling the perfons fo accufed» Several refpediable 
perfons at Bance Ifland, and to windward of it, all told 
Mr. Town that it was common to bring on ^palavers 
to make faves^ and he believes it from the information of 
the flaves afterwards, vv^hen brought dov/n the country 
and put on board the ihips. 

Off Piccaninni Seftus, farther down on the Windward 
Coaft, Mr. Dove obferved an inftance of a girl 
being kidnapped and brought on board by one Ben 
Johnfon, a black trader, who had fcarcely left the fhip 
in his canoe, with the price of her, when another 
canoe with two black men came in a hurry to the 
fhip, 2nd inquired concerning this girl. Having been 
allowed to fee her, they hurried down to their canoe, 
and haftily paddled off. Overtaking Ben Johnfon, they 
brought him back to the fhip, got him on the quarter-

•^eck, and calling him teefee (which implies thief) to the Mamerof 
captain, offered him for fale.— ^Ben Johnfon remonftrated, ^f^vef fi-of?: 
afking the captain, " if he would buy him whom he the River 
kiiewto be a grand trading man^" to which the captain Gambia to 
anfwered, " if they would fell him, he would certainly ^^^J ^J„j7 
buy him, be he what he v/ould," which he accordingly w^trt/ C;c3^^ 
did, and put him into irons immediately with another 
man. He was led to think, from this inftance, that 
kidnapping was the mode of obtaining flaves upon this 
part of the coaft. 

Lieutenant Storey fays, that flaves are generally ob- 
tained on the Windward coaft by marauding parties, 
from one village to another in the night. He has known 
canoes come from a diftance, and carry off numbers in 
the night. He has gone into the interior country, be- 
tween Baffau and the River Seftus ; and all the nations 
there go armed^ from the fear of marauding parties^ whole 
pillages in thefe countries are termed war. 

At one time in particular, while Mr. Storey was on 
the coaft, a marauding party from Grand Seftus came 
\Ti canoes, and attacked Grand Cora in the night, and 
took off twelve or fourteen of the inhabitants. The 
canoes of Grand Seftus carry twelve or fourteen men, 
and with thefe go a marauding .^mong their neighbours. 
Mr. Storey has often i^^rx them at fea out of fight of 
land in the day, and taking the opportunity of night to 
land where they pleafed. 

Mr. Falconbridge fuppofes the flave trade, on thefe 
parts to be chiefly fupplied by kidnapping. On his fecond 
voyage, at Cape Mount and the Windward Coaft, a 
man was brought on board, well known to the captaia 
and his officers, and was purchafed. This man faid he 
had been invited one evening to drink with his neigh- 
bour?. When about to depart, two of them got up 
to feize him ; and he v/ould have efcaped, but he was 
ftopped by a large dog. He faid this mode of kidnapping 
was common in his country. 

In the fame voyage, two black traders came in a 
canoe, and informed the captain there was trade a little ' 
B lower 



( 10 ) 

}^^amer of lowcr dowVi. The Captain went there, and finding no 
cf^'f r. trade, faid he would not be made a fool, and therefore 
the^R'wcy^ detained one of the canoe -men. In about two hours 
Gambia to afterwards a very fine man was brought on board, and 
%lfvtid- ^^^^' ^"^ ^^ canoe-man was releafed. He was informed 
iward Conjl. by the black pilot, that this man had been furrounded and 

feized on the beach, from whence he had been brought 

to the fhip and fold. 

I4a>rmr of Lieutenant Simpfon fays, from what he faw, he believes 
sfawfon the^^^ ^^^^ trade is the occafion of wars among the natives. 
GoldCoaJl, From the natives of the Windward Coaft he underftood 
that the villages were always at war; and the black 
traders and others gave as a reafon for it, that the kings 
wanted JIaves, If a trading canoe, along-fide Mr. 
Simpfon's fhip, faw a larger canoe coming from a village 
they were at war with-, they inflantly fled ; and fometimes 
without receiving the value of their goods. On inquiry, 
he learned their reafons to be, that if taken they would 
have been made flaves. 

Mr. How ftates, that when at Secundee, fome or- 
der came from Cape Coaft Caftle. The fame after- 
noon feveral parties went out armed^ and returned the 
fame night with a number of flaves, which were put 
into the. repofitory c^ the factory. Next morning he faw 
people, who came to fee the captives, and to requeft Mr. 
Marfh, the refident, to releafe fome of their children and 
relations. Some were releafed, and part fent off to Cape 
Coaft Caftle. He had every reafon to believe they had 
been obtained unfairly^ as they came at an unfeafonable 
time of the night, and from their parents and friends 
crying and begging their releafe. He was told as 
much from Mr. Marfh himfelf, who faid, he did not mind 
how they got them'^ for he purchafed them fairly. He 
cannot tell whether this pra£l:ice fubfifted before; but 
when he has gone into the v/oods he hns met thirty or 
forty natives, who fled always at his appearance, although 
they were armed. Mr. Marfh faid, they were afraid of 
his taking them prifoners. 

The 



C " ) 

The fame Mr. Marfh made no fcruple alfoof {hewing ^««««5' of 
him the ftores i^i the factory. They confifted of different "^^avefon tU. 
kinds of chains made of iron, as likewife an inftrument GoidCoaJi, 
made of wood, about five inches long, or an inch ia 
diameter, or lefs, which he was told by Mr. Marfh was 
thruft into a man's mouth horizontally, and tied behind 
to prevent him from crying otit^ when tranj^oried at night 
along the country ^ 

Dr. Trotter fays, that the natives of thefe parts are 
fometimes flaves from crimes, but the greater part of the 
flaves are, what are called prifoners of war. Of his 
whole cargo he recolle6i:s only three criminals ; two fold 
for adultery, and one for witchcraft, whofe whole family 
fhared his fate. One of the firft faid he had been decoyed 
by a woman who had told her hufband, and he was fen- 
tenced to pay a flave ; hut being poor^ was fold himfelf. 
Such Jiraiagems are frequent : the fourth mate of Dr. 
Trotter's fhip was fo decoyed, and obliged to pay a flave, 
under the threat of flopping trade. The laft faid he had 
had a quarrel with a Cabolheer (or great man) who in 
revenge accufed him of witchcraft, and fold him and his 
family for flaves. 

Dr. Trotter having often afked Accra, a principal 
trader at Le Hou, what he meant by prifoners of war^ 
found they were fuch as were carried off by afetofma- 
raudersy who ravage the country for that purpofe. The 
bufti-men making war to make trade (that is to make 
flaves) was a common way of fpeaking among the 
traders. The practice was alfo confirmed by the flaves 
on board, who fhewed by geftures how the robbers had 
come upon them ; and during their pailage from Africa 
to the Well Indies, fome of the boy-flaves played a 
game, which they called fave-takingj or bufh-fighting ; 
ihewing the different manoeuvres thereof in leaping, fally- 
ing, and retreating. Inquiries of this nature put to wo- 
men, were anfwered only by violent bur/Is off arrow. 

He once faw a black trader fend his canoe to take 
three fifhermen employed in the offing, who were im- 
mediately brought on board, and put in irons, and about 
a week afterwards he was paid for them. He remembers 
B % another 



( 12 J 

ji^mner ef another man taken in the fame way from on board a 

wahng canoe along-fide. The Jame trader very frequently fent 

en the Gold Jl^ves OH bcarci in the nighty which, from their own infor- 

Coaji, mation, he found, were every one of the-n taken in the 

neighbourhood of Annamaboe. He remarked, that flaves 

fent off in the night, were not paid for till they had been 

fome time on board, leil, he thinks, they fhould be 

claimed ; for fome were really reftored, one in particular, 

a boy, was carried on (hore by fome near relations, 

which boy told him, he had lived in the neighbourhood 

of Annamaboe, and was kidnapped. 

There were many boys and girls on board Dr. Trot^ 
ter's fhip, who had no relations on board. Many of 
them told him they had been kidnapped in the neighbour- 
hood of Annamaboe, particularly a girl of about eight 
years old, who faid ihe had been carried off from her 
mother by the man who fold her to the fhip. 

Mr. Falconbridge was affured by the Rev. Philip 
Quakoo, chaplain at Cape Coaft Caftle, on the Gold 
Coaff, that the greatefl number of flaves were made by 
kidnapping. 

He has heard that the great men on this part of the 
coaft, drefs up and employ women^ to entice young men to 
be connected with them, that they may be conviSled of 
adultery and fold ^ 

Lieutenant Simpfon heard at Cape Coaft Caftle, and 
other parts of the Gold Coaft, repeatedly ff-om the black 
traders, that th^JIave trade made wars and palavers, Mr, 
Quakoo, chaplain at Cape Coaft Caftle, informed him, 
that wars were made in the interiour parts, for the fole 
purpofe of getting faves. 

There are two crimes on the Gold Coaft, which feem 
made on purpofe to procure flaves ; adultery and the re- 
moval of fetiches.* As to adultery, he was warned a- 
gainft conne61:ing himfelf with any woman not pointed 
out to him, for that the kings kept feveral who were fent 

* Certain things of various forts, to which the fuperftition of the 
country has oxciered, for various reafonSj, an attention to be paid.

( 13 ) 

mit to allure the unwary^ and that. If found to be connecSl- ^^^^^_^«^ »/ 
ed with thefe, he would be feized, and made to pay the ^^^^JJf 
price of a man Have. As to fetiches, confifting of pieces o?? the Gold 
of wood, old pitchers, kettles, and the like, laid in the ^°^fi' 
path-ways, he was warned to avoid difplacing them, for 
if he fhould, the natives who were on the watch, v^'ould 
feize him, and, as before, exact the price of a man flave. 
Thefe baits are laid equally for natives and Europeans ; 
but the form^er are better acquainted with the law, and 
confequently more upon their guard. 

Mr. Ellifon fays, that while one of the fhips he be- Mamer of 
longed to, viz. the Briton, was lying in Benin river, »«^^^""f 
Capt. Lemma Lemma, a Benin trader, came on board to ''^he'^EiveT 
receive his cuftoms. This man being on the deck, and Bm!?i to the 
happening to fee a canoe with three people In it, croffing ^i'^erAmbm 
the river, difpatched one of his own canoes to feize and 
take it. Upon overtaking it, they brought it to the fhlp. 
It contained three perfons, an old man and a young man 
and woman. The chief mate bought the two latter, but 
the former being too old, was refuled. Upon this, Lem- 
ma ordered the old man into the canoe, where his head 
was chopped off, and he was thrown overboard. Lem- 
ma had many war canoes, fome of which had fix or eight 
fwivels ; he feemed to be feared by the reft of the na- 
tives. Mr. Ellifon did not fee a canoe out on the river 
while Lemma was there, except this, and if they had 
known he had been out, they would not have come. He 
difcovered by figns, that the old man killed was the fa- 
ther of the two other negroes, and that they were brought 
there by force. They were not the iubjeAs of Lemma. 

At Bonny, fays Mr. Falconbridge, the greateft num- 
ber of {laves come from inland. Large canoes, fome 
having a three or four pounder lafhed on their bows, go 
to the up country, and in eight or ten days return with 
great numbers ot flaves : he heard once, to the amount 
of twelve hundred at one t ne. The people in thefe 
canoes have generally cutiaflcs, and a quantity of muf- 
kets, but he cannot tell for waat ufe, 

Mr« 



( 14 ) 

Mamff of Mr. Falconbrldge does not believe that many of thefe 

Slaveffi-om ^^^cs are prifoners of war, as we underfland the word war, 

the River In Pi^ucz^ a piratical expedition for inaktng Jlaves^is t^Ym." 

Benm to the ed war, A confiderable trader at Bonny explained to 

;;/ >^^Yi\m the meaning of this word, and faid, that they went 

in the night, fet fire to towns, and caught the people as 

they fled from the flames. The fame trader faid, that 

this pradtice was very common. 

Mr. Falconbridge fays alfo, that in his third voyage, 
which was to Bonny, a woman was brought on board 
big with child. As fhe attracted his notice, he afked her, 
by means of the interpreter, how fhe came to be fold. 
Her reply was, that returning home from a vifit, flie was 
feized, and after being pafl^ed through various hands, was 
brought down to the water-fide, and fold to a trader, who 
afterwards fold her to the fhip. 

In the fame voyage an elderly man brought on board 
faid (through the interpreter) that he and his fon were 
feized as they wee planting yams, by profeflTed kidftap- 
pers, by which he means perfons who make kidnapping 
their co77flant pra£lice. 

On his lafl: voyage, which was alfo to Bonny, a canoe 
came along-fide his veflTel, belonging to a noted trader in 
flaves, from which a fine ftout fellow was handed on 
board, and fold. Mr. Falconbridge feeing the man ama- 
zed and confounded when he difcovered himfelf to be 
a flave, inquired of him, by means of an interpreter, 
why he was fold. He replied, that he had had occafionto 
come to Bonny to this trader's houfe, who afked if he 
had ever feen a fhip. Replying no, the trader faid, he 
would treat him with the fight of one. The man confent- 
ing, faid he was thereupon brought on board, and thus 
treacheroufly fold. All the flaves Mr. Falconbridge 
ever talked to by means of interpreters, faid they had 
been ftolen. 

Mr. Douglas, when afliore at Bonny Point, faw a 
young woman come out of the wood to the water-fide 
to bathe. Soon afterwards two men came from the wood, 
feized, bound, and beat her for making refiftance, and 
bringing her to him, Mr* Douglas, defired him to put her 

on 



C IS ) 

on board, which he did ; the captain's orders were, when Mamier «f 
any body brought down flaves, inftantly to put them oiF^'^^'^JJ^^ 
to the fhip. ^ _ f/,e Rf^r 

When a fliip arrives at Bonny, the king fends his war Setnn to thz 
canoes up the rivers, where they furprife all they can lay ^''^^*'^'^r^^ 
hold of. They had a young man on board, who was 
thus captured, with his father, mother, and three fifters. 
The young man afterwards in Jamaica having learnt 
Englifh, told Mr. Douglas the ftory, and faid it was a 
common pra<Si:ice, Thefe war canoes are always armed. 
The king's canoes came with flaves openly in the day ; 
others in the evening, with one or two flaves bound, ly- 
ing in the boats bottom, covered with matts. 

Mr. Morley flates, that in Old Calabar perfons are 
fold as flaves for adultery and theft. On pretence of 
fidultery^ he remembers a woman fold. 

He has been told alfo by the natives at Calabar, that 
they took flaves in what they call war^ which he found 
was -putting the villages in confufion^ and catching them as 
they coukL A man on board the fhip he was in, ftiewed 
how he was taken at night by furprife, and faid his wife 
and children were taken with him, but they were not in 
the fame Ihip. Mr. Morley had reafon to think, from 
the man's words, that they took nearly the whole village^ 
that is, all thofe that could not get away. 

Captain Hall fays, when a fhip arrives at Old Cala- 
bar, or the River Del-Rey, the traders always go up in- 
to the country for flaves. They go in their war canoes, 
and take with them fome goods, which they get previ- 
oufly from the (hips. 

He has feen from three to ten canoes in a fleet, each 
with from forty to fixty paddlers, and twenty to thirty 
traders and other people with mufkets, fuppofe one to 
feach man, with a three or four pounder laflied on the bow 
of the canoe. They are generally abfent from ten days to 
three weeks, when they return with a number of flaves 
pinioned, or chained together. 

Captain Hall has often aflied the mode of procuring 
flaves inland, and has been told by the traders, that they 

have 



( i6 ) 

MMfrey of i^^yQ been got in war, and fold by the perfons takins 



Slaws from ^"^"^' 
the River 

Benin io the Mr. J. Parker fays, he left the flilp t;o which he be- 
^'*"'^^^'''' longed at Old Calabar, where being kilidly received by 
the king's fon, he ftaid with him on the continent for 
five months. During this time he was prevailed upon: 
by the king's fon, to accompany him to w^r.* Accor- 
dingly, having fitted out and armed the canoes, they 
went up the river Calabar. In the day time they lay 
under the bufhes when they approached a village, but at 
night flew up to it, and took hold of every one they 
could fee ; thefe they handcuffed, brought down to the 
canoes, and fo proceeded up the river till they got to the 
amount of forty five, with whom they returned to New- 
town, where fending to the captains of the fhipping, they 
divided them among the fhips. 

About a fortnight after this expedition, they went a- 
gain, and were out eight or nine days, plundering other 
villages higher up the river. They feized on much the 
fame number as before, brought them to New-town, gave 
the fame notice, and difpofed of them as before among 
the fhips. 

They took man, woman and child, as they could catch 
them in the houfes, and except fucking children, who 
went with their mothers, there was no care taken to pre- 
vent the feparation of the children from the parents when 
fold. When fold to the Englifh merchants they lament- 
ed, and cried that they were taken away by force. 

The king at Old Calabar was certainly not at war with 
the people up this river, nor had they made any attack 
upon him. It happened that flaves were very flack in the 
back country at that time, and were wanted when he 
went on thefe expeditions, 

'■^ The reader Is earneftly requefted to take notice, that the word ivar^ 
as adopted into the African language, means in general robbery, or a ma- 
rauding expedition, for the fuypok of getting Jlaves. Two noted black tra'* 
clers are found themfelves to have explained the term to two of the Evi- 
dences (Trotter, p. ii. Falconbiidge, p, 14.) and it appears decidedly 
by the accounts of Waditroiu, Town, Bowman, Storey, Morley, and 
J, Parker, that the catching of men is denominated by the Africans to 
te war. 

Mr. 



{ I? ) 

Mr. Falconbrldge thinks crimes are falfely Imputed, Ma,msr of 
for the fake of felling the accufed. On the fecond voy- '^^^^^ 
age at the river Ambris, among the Haves brought on ,J^i?'-^^°''* ' 
board was one who had the craw craw, a kind of itch. Bmin to tht 
He was told by one of the Tailors, that this man was filh- ^^•^'^^^'^^rh 
ing in the river, when a king's officer, called Mambooka^ 
wanted brandy and other goods in the boaty but having no 
JIave io buy them with^ accufed this man of extortion in the 
[ale of his fijh^ and after fome kind of trial on the beach, 
condemned him to be fold. He was told this by the 
boat's crew who were afhore when it happened, who told 
it as of their own knowledge. 

Befides the accounts juft given, from what the above 
witnefTes faw and heard on the coaft of Africa, as to the 
different methods of making flaves, there are others con- 
tained In the evidence, which were learnt from the mouths 
of the flaves themfelves, after their arrival in the Weft- 
Indies. 

Some of thefe have informed feveral of the witnefles 
on this occafion, that they were taken in war, (Hall and 
Woolrich) others, that they were taken by furprife in 
their towns, or while at work in. their fields, (Hall) or as 
they were ftraggling from their huts, or cultivating their 
lands, (Dalrymple) or tending their corn : (Woolrich) 
others, that they were taken by armed canoes up the 
rivers, (Douglas) others, by ftratagem, (Cook) or kid- 
napped, (Rev. Mr. Davies, Dean of Middleham, Mr. 
Fitzmaurlcc) which kidnapping prevailed in the inland 
parts at a great diftance from the fhore, (Dr. Harrifon) 
and was with fome a profefled occupation, and a com* 
moa practice (Falconbridge and Clappefon.}

their flaves when the French and Englifh were at war, 

was anfwered, that when/hips ceafed to come^ flaves ceafed 

to be taken. 

Mr. Ifaac Parker fays, that the king of Old Calabar 
was certainly not at war with the people up that river, 
nor had they made any attack on him. It happened that 
Haves were very flack in the back country at this time, 
and vjere wanted when he went on the expeditions^ de- 
fcribed in a former page (p. i6)

this method to efFe6l their purpofe. When fober, he Somttmes 
always exprefTed a reKi6tance to harrafs his people. Mr. i^fi additional 
Wadftrom alfo heard the king hold the fame language on ^-J^'th^l^a- 
diiFerent days, and yet he afterwards ordered the pillage //Va^o/^mc- 
to be executed. Mr. Wadftrom has no doubt, but that^^/^ ^^^"^^ 
he alfo pillages in other parts of his dominions, fince it is 
the cujiom of the mulatto merchants (as both they and 
the French officers declare) when they want fiaves, to 
go to the kings, and excite them to pillages^ which are 
ufually pra6tifed on all that part of the coaft. 

The French Senegal company alfo, in order to obtain 
their compliment of Haves, had recourfe to their ufual 
method on fimilar occafions, namely, of bribing the MoorSy 
and fupplying them with arms and ammunition^ to feizs 
ting Dalmammy's fubjefts. By January 12th, 178?, 
when Mr. Wadftrom arrived at Senegal, fifty had been 
taken, whom the king defired to ranfom, but they had 
been all difpatched to Cayenne. Some v/ere brought in 
every day afterwards, and put in the company's ilave- 
hold, in a miferable ilate, the greater part being badly 
wounded by fab res and mufket balls. The direilor of 
the company conducted Mr. Wadftrom there, with Dr. 
Spaarman, whom he confulted as a medical man in their 
behalf. Mr. Wadftrom particularly remembers one 
lying in his blood, which flowed from a wound made by 
a ball in his fhoulder. 

Mr. Dalrymple underftood it common for European 
traders to advance, goods to Chiefs, to induce thein tofeize 
their fubjefts or neighbours. Not one of the Mu- 
latto traders at Goree ever thought of denying it. 

Mr. Bowman having fettled at -the head of Scaflus 
river, informed the king, and others, that he was come to 
refide as a trader, and that his orders were^ to fupply them 
with powder and ball^ and to etitourage them to go to war. 
They anfwered, they would go to war in two or three 
days. By this time they came to the fa6lory, faid they 
v/ere going to war, and wanted powder, ball, rum and 
tobacco. When thefe were given them, they went off

Mr, Morley owns, with ^ame, that he has ma^e the 
natives diunh^ in order to buy a good man or woman 
Have, to whom he fcmnd them attached. He has {^tn 
this done by others. Captain Hildebrand, commanding 
a Hoop of Mr. Pirue's, bought one of the wives of a man, 
whom he had previoujly made drimh^ and who Vf'ilhed to 
redeem her, v^hen iober next day, as did the perfon he 
(Mr. Morley) bought the man of, but neither of them 
was given up. He fuppofes they would have given 5 
third more than the price paid, to have redeemed them., 

Sir George Young fays, that when at Annamaboe, at 
Mr. Brue's, (a very great merchant there) Mr. Brue 
had two hoftages, kings fons, for payment for arms, and 
all kinds of military ftores, which he had fupplied to the 
two kings^ vi^ho were at war with each other, to procure 
Jlavesfor at le oft fix or [even Jhips^ then lying in the road. 
The prifoners on both fides were brought down to Mr, 
Brue, and fent to the fhips. 

Mr. J. Parker has known prefents made by the Cap-. 

tai^s, to the black traders, to induce them to bring flaves. 

Captain Colley in particular gave them fome pieces of 

cannon, which he himfelffaw landed. 

Frequently On the fubjedl: of Europeans attempting to carry ofF

Mr. Wadftrom v/as Informed at Goree, by Captain ^?Va, and 
Wignle, from Rochelle, who v/as juft arrived from i\\q f''^^^^""^ 
river Gambia, that a little before his departure from that 
river, three Englifh veflels were cut off by the natives, 
owing to th© captain of one of them, who had his cargo, 
being tempted by a fair, wind, to fail away with, feveral 
of the free negroes, then drinking with the crew. Soon 
afterwards the wind changed, and he was driven back, 
feized, and killed, with all his crew, and thofe of the two 
other veflels. Mr. Wadftrom has, by accident, met 
with the infiirer of two of thefe veffels in London, who * 
confirmed the above fa6ts. 

Captain Hills fays a man at Gambia, who called him- 
felf a prince's brother, had been carried off to the Weft 
Indies, by an Fnglifh fhip, but making his cafe known 
to the governor, was fent by him to Europe. Captain 
Hills was advifed not to go on fliore at Gambia, by the 
merchants there, for fear of being taken by the natives, 
who owed the Englifh a grudge for fome injuries re- 
ceived. 

Mr, John Bowman fays, that when a mate under 
Captain Strangeways, the fliip then lying in the river 
S. Leon, at Whi*-e Man's Bay, ready to (ail, he was fent 
on fhore to invite two traders on board. They came 
and v/ere (hewn into the cabin. Mean time people were 
employed in Tett'.ne; the fail?, it being almofl: night, and 
the land breeze making down the river. When they 
had weighed anchor, and got out to fea, Mr. Bowman 
was called down by the captain, who, pointing to the 
fail^cafe, defired him to look mto it and fee what a fine 

* The editor faw, in the month of A pril, 1791, in St. Thomas's hof- 
pital, a young lad, the only one of thethiee crews that was fufFered to ef-

ment up the country, he was brought oft" by accident, by an Englilh

Frequently prize he had got. To his furprize, he faw lying fafl 
ttttenipt them- ■^{[qq^^ the tvvo men who had come on board with him,

tivcs, and them there. When they awoke they were fent upon 
jomctimes deck, Ironcd, and put forward among the other Haves.

The Rev. Mr. Newton has known fhips and boats cut 
ofFat Sherbro, ufually in retaliation. 

Once when he was on fliore, the traders fuddenly 
, put him into his long-boat, telling him that a fhip juft 

pafled had carried off two people. Had it been known 
in the town, he would have been detained. He has 
known many other fuch inftances, but after thirty-fix 
years, he cannot fpecify them. It was a geneial opinion, 
founded on repeated and indifputable fa6ts, that depre- 
dations of this fort \YQre frequently committed by the Ew 
ropeajis, 

Mr. Newton has fometimes found all trade flopped, 
and the depredations of European traders have been 
affigned by the natives as the caufe^ and he has more than 
once or twice made up breaches of this kind between the 
fhips and the natives. 

He believes fevetal captains of Have fhips were honeft 
humane men ; but he has good reafon to think, they 
were not all fo. The taking off fiaves by force has 
been thought mofl frequent in the laft voyages of cap- 
tains. He has often heard mailers and ofHcers exprefs 
this opinion. Depredations and reprifals made to get 
them were fo frequent that the Europeans and Africans were 
hi a fpirit of ?nutual diftruft : he does not mean that 
there were no depredations except in their laft voy- 
ages. He has known Liverpool and Briflol fhips ma- 
terially injured from the condu6l of fome fhips, from the 
fame ports, that had left the coaft. It is a fact that fome 
captains have committed depredations in their lail voy- 
ages who have not been known to have done it be- 
fore. 

Mr. Towne was once prefent with part of the crew of 
bis fhip the Sailyj at an expedition undertaken by the 

whites 



( 23 ) 

whites for felzing negroes, and joined by other boats to Frequently 
receive thofe they could catch. To prevent all alarm, ^^^^"^Z^^'^''^- 
they bound the mouths of the captives, with oakum ^nd-^offlhl'^Na? 
handkerchiefs. One woman fhrieked and the natives ^^Va, «;7i 
turned out in defence. He had then five of them tied mf'^metmes 
the boat, and the o-ther boats were in readinefs to take^^"^^^^^* 
in what more they could get. All his party were armed, 
and the men of the town purfued them with firft a fcat- 
tering, and at length a general fire, and feveral of the 
men belonging to the boats, he has reafon to believe, 
were killed, v/ounded, or taken, as he never heard of 
them afterwards. He was wounded hirafelf. The 
Haves he had taken were fold at Charleftown, South Caro- 
lina, The natives had not previoufly committed any 
hoftilities againfl: any of the fhips, whofe boats were 
concerned in this tranfa£lion. They owed goods to the 
captain, for which he refolved to obtain flaves at any 
rate. He has had feveral iliip-mates, who have themfelves ' ' 

told him, they have been concerned in fimilar tranfac- 
tions, and have made a boafi: of it, and who have been 
wounded alfo. 

Mr, Falconbrldge was informed by Captain Gould 
of the Alert, that he had carried off a man from Little 
Cape Mount. 

Mr. Storey believes the natives of the Windward 
Coaft are often fraudulently carried off by the Europeans. 
He has been told by them, that they had loft their friends 
at different times, and fuppofed them taken by European 
Ihips going along the coaft. He has himfelf taken up 
canoes at fea, which were challenged by the natives, 
who fuppofed the men in them had been taken off the 
day before by a Dutchman. 

When once at an anchor, in his boat, between the 
river S eft us and Settra Crue, he prevented the crew of 
a long-boat, belonging to a Dutchman then lying off 
fhore, from being cut off bv the natives, v/ho gave as 
a reafon for their intentions, that a iliip of that country 
fome days before had takm off four men belonging to the 
place. 

Afterwards 



( H ) 

Fycquer.fly Afterwards, in 1768, being in a boat, with two other 
7Sto^c7n^^'^^^ perfons, the natives attacked them. Both the 
off the Ka- former were killed, and he himfelf, covered with blood 
tivcs.and and wounds, was only fufFered to efcape, by confenting 
fucll'cdl^ to give up boat and cargo, and to go to Gaboon. The 
The reafon the natives gave for this procedure was, that 
a fhip from Liverpool (one Captain Lambert) had, 
fome time before, taken a canoe full of their tovjnfmen^ 
and carried her away. He heard the fame thing con- 
firmed afterwards at Gaboon. 

Mr. Douglas ftates, that near Cape Coaft the natives 
make fmoke as a fignal for trade. On board his fhip 
(the Warwick Caflie) they faw the fmoke and ftood in 
fhore, which brought off many canoes. Pipes, tobacco, 
and brandy, were got on deck, to entice the people in 
them on hoard. The gratings were unlaid, the flave- 
room cleared, and every preparation made to feize them ; 
two only could be prevailed on to come up the fhip's fide, 
who ftood in the main chains, but on the feamen ap- 
proaching them they jumped off, and the canoes all made 
ibr ftiore. 

The Gregfon's people, while at Bonny, informed Mr. 
Douglas, that in running down the coaft, they had kid- 
napped thirty- two of the natives. He faw flaves on 
board that fliip when fhe came in, and it is not cufiomary 
for ftiips bound to Bonny, to ftop and trade by the way* 

Mr. How fays, that abreaft of Cape La Hou, feveral 
canoes came alongfide of his Majefty's fhip Grampus, 
and on coming on board informed the captain, that an 
Englifh Guinea-trader a fortnight before had taken off 
fix canoes with men, who had gone off to them with pro- 
vifions for trade. On coming to Appolonia he was alfo 
told by Mr. Buchanan, the refident there, that a Guinea- 
man, belonging to one Griffith, an Englifhman, and a 
notorious trader and kidnapper, between Cape La Hou 
and Appolonia, was then in that latitude. 

Captain Hall was told by Capt. Jeremiah Smith, that 
in 1 77 1, a Captain Fox had taken off fome people from 
the Windward Cgaft, 

He 



( 25 ) 

He fays alfo, that the boat's crew of the Venus, -^^ff^-^"*''>' " 
Captain Smith, which had been fent to Fernandipo forfr^''^'"''-' 
yams from Laiabar, enticed a canoe to come alongfide off the Na- 
that had about ten men in her. As foon as ihe got near, ^^■ves,and 
the boat's crew fired into her, on which they jumped ^^^^^^^'J" 
overboard : fome were wounded, and one was taken 
out of the water, and died in lefs than an hour in the 
boat : two others were taken up unhurt, and carried to 
Old Calabar to the fhip. Captain Smith was angr/at 
the OiScer for this procedure, and fent back the two men 
to the bay, from whence they had been taken. Imme- 
diately after the boat had committed this depredation. 
Captain Hall happened to go into the fame bay in his 
own ihip's long-boat, and fending on ihore two men to 
fill water, they were furrounded by the natives, who drove 
three fpears in- o one of the men, and v/ounded the other 
with a large ftick, in confequence of taking away the 
two men juft mentioned. It was faid that the crew had 
difputed with the natives on flaore when trading with 
them for yams, but the former had not done any of the 
boat's crew any injury. 

Mr. Ellifon knew two flaves taken from the ifland of 
Fernandipo by the Dobfon's boat of Liverpool, and cat- 
ried to Old Calabar, where the fhip lay. He vvent to the 
fame ifland for yams, a few days after the tranfaftion,, 
and fired, as the ufual fignal, for the natives to bring 
them. Seeing fome of them peep through the bufhes, 
he wondered why they w^ould not come to the boat. He 
accordingly fwam on iliore, when fome of the iflanders 
came round him : an old man fhewed, by figns, that a 
fhip's boat had flolen a man and woman. Fie v/as then 
foon furrounded by numbers, who prefented darts to him, 
fignifying they would kill him, if the man and woman 
Vv^ere not brought back. Upon this, the people in the 
boat fired fome ihot, when they ail ran into the v/oods. 
Mr. Ellifon v/ent to Calabar, and told Captain Briggs he 
could get no yams, in confequence of the tvv'o people 
being ftolen ; upon Vvhich Captain Briggs told the captain 
of the Dobfon, there would be no more trade if he did 
not deliver up the people, which he at length did. As 
D foon 



( 25 ) 

Trecjucnily foon as the natives faw their countrymen^ they loaded 
tZTto can'y^^^ boat with yams, goats, fowls, honey, and palm- wine: 
off the Na-" and they would take nothing for them. They had the 
tivesyord jnan and woman delivered to them, whom they carried 
r^clecdT away in their arms. The DobH^n ciid not Hay above 
eight, ten, or twelve days. This was the lafi t?^ip her 
boat was to make, when they carried off the two flaves. 

Mr. Morley fays, that when off Taboo, two men 
€am,e in a canoe, along-fide his veffel. One of them 
came up, and fat on the netting, but would not come 
into the fliip. The captain at len2;th, inticing him, in- 
toxicated him fo with brandy and laudanum, that he fell 
in upon deck. The captain then ordered him to be put 
into the men's room, with a centry over him. The 
other man in the canoe, after calling in vain for his 
companion, paddled off faft towards the fhore. The 
captain fired feveral mufket balls after him, which did not 
hit him. About three or four leagues farther down, two 
men came on board from another canoe. While they 
were on board, a drum was kept beating' near the man 
who had been feized, to prevent his hearing them, or 
they him. 

He fays again, in fpeaking of another part of the 
coafb, that Captain Briggs's chief mate, in Old Calabar 
River, lying in ambufh to ilop the natives coming dov/n 
the creek, purfued Oruk Robin John, who, jumping on 
fhore, fhot the mate through the head. 

He fays alfo, of another part of the coafl, thst a Mr, 
Walker, mafter of a Hoop, was on board the Jolly Frince, 
Captain Lambert, when the king of Nazareth ftabbed the 
captain at his own table, and took the veffel, putting all 
the v/hites to death, except the cook, a boy, and, he 
believes, one man. Captain Walker, being af^ed why 
the king of Nazareth took this ffep, faid, it was on 
account of the people, whom Matthews ha] carried off 
from Gaboon and Cape Lopez the voyage before. Walker 
efcaped, by knowing the language of the country. 

Mr. Mcrley failed afterwards with the fame Captain 
Matthews to Gaboon River, where the Chiefs fons 
came on board him to demand what he had done with 

their 



( 27 ) 

their fons, and the boys he had carried off, (the fame as ^reqimnly 
Walker alluded to) and toM him, that it he dared ^o^'I^ZTttcarry 
corne on i]i:>re, they would have his head. off the Na- 

As a farther corroboration, that fuch pra£lices as the ^'"^^^^ ^"'^ 
above take place, it aopears in evidence, that the nat'ves 5^'|.'J^!^^^^ 
of the coafl and iflands are found con^antly hovering in 
their canoes, at a difcance, about fuch vefTels as are 
palling by, fhy of coming on board, for fear of being 
taken oiF, [Hall, Falconbridge, Claxton, Bowman, &c.] 
But if they can difcover that fuch vefTels are not in the 
flave trade^ but are tnen of vjar^ they come on board 
readily^ [Sir George Young] or without any hejitatlon^ 
which they v/ould not otherzvife have done, [Mr. Howe J 
and in numbers^ [Lieutenant Sinipfon] and traverfe the 
fhips with as much confidence as if they had been on JhorCy 
[Captain Wilfon.] 

Mr. Ellifon fays, when he was lying at Yanamaroo, ^^tropcans 
in the Gambia, flaves were brought down. The traders -^^'J^^Jl^-^^/^ 
raifed the price. 7"he captains would not give it, hnt proper oji the 
thought to compel them by firing upon the town. They ^^^/^^ ^'"^ 
fired red hot (hot from the ihip, and fet feveral houfes on "'^^^athZfLe 
fire. All the fnips, feven or eight, fired. %i their 

Mr. Falconbridge heard Captain Vicars, of a Briftol^^^'^V;^^'-'^ 
fhip, fay at Bonny, when his traders were flack, he fired ^^^^^^^'^''^''^ 
a gun into or over the town, to frefhen their way. 
Captain Vicars told this to him and other peopk there 
at the time, but he has feen no inflance of it himfelf. 

Mr. Tfaac Parker fays, the Guinea captains lying m 
Old Calabar River, fixed on a certain price, and agreed 
to lie under a ;f .50 bond, if any one of them fhould 
give more for flaves than another ; in confequence of 
which, the natives did not readily bring flaves on board 
to fell at thofe prices ; upon which, the captains ufed to 
row guard at nighu, to take the canoes as they paffed the 
fhips, and fo flopping the flaves from getting to their 
towns, prevent the traders from getting them. Thefe 
they took on board the different fhips, and kept them 
till the traders agreed to fave at the old prices^

the Natives 

Captain Hall fay?., in Old Calabar River there are two 
towns. Old Town and New Tovi^n. A rivalOiip in trade 
produced a jealoufy between the towns; fo that through 
fear of each other, for a confiderable time, no canoe 
would leave their towns to go up the river for Jlaves. This 
happened in 1 767. In this year feven fhips, of which 
five were the following — Duke of York, Be van, — Edgar, 
Lace, — Indian Queen, Lewi?, — Nancy, Maxwell — and 
Canterbury, Sparkes, — lay off the point which feparates 
the towns. Six of the captains invited the people of 
both towns on board on a certain dav, as if to reconcile 
them : at the fame time they agreed with the people of 
New Town to cut off all the Oid Town people who 
fhould remain on board the next morning. The Old 
Town people perfuaded of the fincerity of the captains 
propofal, went onboard in great numbers. Next morning, 
at eight o'clock, one of the fliips fired a gun, as a 
fignal to commence hoftilities. Some of the traders 
were fecured on board, fome were killed in refilling, and 
fom.e got overboard, and v^ere fired upon. Vvhen the 
firing began, the New Town people, who were in ambuih 
behind the Point, came forward, and picked up the peo- 
ple of Old Tov/n, who were fwimming, and had efcaped 
the firing. After the firing was over, the captains of 
five of the fhips delivered their prifoners ^perfons of con- 
fequence) to the New Town canoes, two of whom were 
beheaded alongfide the fhips. The inferior prifoners were 
carried to the Weft Indies. One of the captains, who 
had fecured three of the king's brothers, delivered one of 
them to the chief man of New Town, who was one of 
the two beheaded alongfide ; the other brothers he kept 
on board, promifing, wheti the Jhip was jlavei^ to deliver 
them to the chief man of New Tov/n. His fnip was 

foon 



( 29 ) 

foot! flaved on account of his promife, and the number of-^^''^/^^'" 
prifoners made that day; but he refufed to deliver the -^TXv^/'^* 
king's two brothers, according to his promife, and cdiV- proper on the 
ried them to the Weft Indies, and fold them. It hap- <^°¥> f^^ 
pened in procefs of time, that they efcaped to Virginia, ^^lanlmjL 
and from thence, after three years, to Briftol, where the Iz their 
captain who brought them, fearing he had done wrong, ^f«%^'»'''^ 
meditated carrying, or fending them back, but Mr. Jones 5^^^^/''^" 
of Briftol, who had /hips trading to Old Calabar, and 
hearing who they were, had them taken from the fhip, 
(where they were in irons) by Habeas Corpus. After 
inquiry how they were brought from Africa, they were 
liberated, and put in one of Mr. Jones's fhips for Old 
Calabar, where Captain Hall v/as, when they arrived in 
the fhip Cato, Langdon. 

So Satisfied were the people of Old Town, in 1767, 
of the fmcerity of the captains v/ho invited them, and of 
the New Town people, towards a reconciliation, that the 
night before the maflacre, the chief man of Old Town 
gave to the chief man of New Town, one of his favour- 
ite women as a wife. It was faid that from three to four 
hundrsd perfons were killed that day, in the ihips, in the 
water, or carried off" the coaft. 

The king efcaped from the fhip he v/as in, by killing 
tv/o of the crew, who attempted to feize him. He then 
got into a one-man canoe, and paddled to the fliore. A 
fix pounder from one of the fliips ftruck the canoe to 
pieces ; he then fwam on fliore to the woods near the 
fhips, and reached his own town, though clofely purfued. 
It was faid he received eleven wounds from mufket (hot. 

Captain Hall, in his firft voyage on board the Nep- 
tune, had this account from the boatfwain, Thomas 
R-Utter, who, in 1767, had been boatfwain to the Can- 
terbury, Captain Sparkes, of kondon, and concerned in 
the faid mafTacre. K utter toid him the (tory exa6lly as 
related, and never varied in it. He had it alfo from the 
kings two brothers, who agreed exactly vv^ith Rutttr. 

Captain Hall alfo faw at Calabar, in the pofleffion of 
the king's two brothers, their depofitions taken at Brif- 
tol, and of Mr. Floyd, who was mate of one of the fhips 
when the tranfadion happened, but he took no copy. 

Mr, 



( 30 ) 

Europeans Mr. Millar fays, that a quarrel happened between the 
>'^'^J|?^^^^^ people of Old and New Town, which prevented the fhips 
proper' on thc'^y'^^Z in Calabar river from being flaved. He believes 
Coajl.nnd in June 1767, Captain S. Sparkes, (captain of his fhip, 
tiyeguiltjof ^^g Canterbury) came one evening to him, and told him 
f^Se^ "^that the two towns, fo quarrelling, would meet on board 
dealings 'whht\\Q different fhips, and ordered him to hand up fome 
%'jy''''' fwords. 

The next day feveral canoes, as Sparkes had before ad- 
vertifed him, came from both of the towns, on board the 
Canterbury, Mr. Millar's own fhip, and one of the per- 
fons fo coming on board, brought a letter, which he gave 
Sparkes, immediately on the receipt of which, he, Sparkes, 
, took a hanger, and attacked one of the Old Town peo- 

ple then on board, cutting him immediately on the arms, 
head, and body. The man fled, ran down the fteps lead- 
ing to the cabin, and Sparkes ftill follov/ing him with the 
hanger, darted into the boys room. Mr. Millar is fure 
this circumftance can never be effaced from his memory. 
From this room he was however brought up by means 
of a rope, when Sparkes renewed his attack as before, on 
him, v/ho, making for the entering port, leaped over- 
board. 

This being concluded, Sparkes left his own (hip to go 
on board fome of the other fhips, then lying in the river. 
Soon after he was gone, a boy belonging to Mr. Millar's 
fhip, came and informed him, Mr. Millar, that he had 
difcovered a man concealed behind the medicine chefl. 
Mr. Millar went and found the man. He was the per- 
fon before- mentioned to have brought a letter on board. 
On being difcovered by Mr. Miliar, he begged for mer- 
cy, intreating that he might not be delivered up to the 
people of New Town. He was brought on the quar- 
ter-deck, where were fome of the New Town people, 
who would have killed him, had they not been prevent- 
ed. The man was then ironed, and condu6led into the 
room of the men flaves. 

Soon after this tranfacSlion, the captain returned, and 
brought with him a New Tov/n trader, named Willy 
Honefcy. On coming on board, he was informed of 
what had happened in his abfence, and Mr. Millar be- 

lievesj

Mr. Millar believes, that fome other cruelties, befides 
this particular a6^, were done, becaufe he faw blood on 
the {larboard fide of the mizen-maft, though he does not 
recollect feeing any bodies from whence the blood might 
come ; and others in other fhips, becaufe he heard feve- 
ral mufkets or piflols fired from them at the fame time. 
This affair might lafl ten minutes. He remembers a 
four-pounder fired at a canoe, but knows not if any da- 
mage was done. 

As to other a(Sis of injuilice on the part of the Eu- 
ropeans, fome confider frauds, (fays Mr. NewtonJ as a 
necejjary branch of the flave trade. They put falfe heads 
into powder cafks ; cut ofF two or three yards from the 
middle of a piece of cloth ^ adulterate their fpirits, and 
fteal back articles given. Befides thefe, there are others 
who pay in bottles, which contain but half the contents 
of the famples fhewn (Wadfirom), ufe falfe fteelyards 
and v/eights, (Bowman) and fell fuch guns as burft on 
firing, fo that many qf the natives of the Windward 
Coaft, are without their fingers and thumbs on this ac- 
count, (Lieut. Storey) and It has become a faying, 
*' That thefe guns kill more out of the butt than the 
" muzzle," (Falconbridge). 

Mr. Dalrymple, v/hile at Goree, remembers a fhlp 
attempting to fail out of the bay with a number of flaves, 
without paying for them, but (he was ^o^j^t^ by the guns 
of the fort.

'Enjlavid rX^HE Natives of Africa having been made flaves 
tmlcdejcchd A ^" ^^^ manner defcribed in the former chapters, 
cw board— are brought dow'n for fale to the European fhips. 

Cauje of this 

eje ion. q^ being brought on board, fays Dr. Trotter, they 
fhevsr figns of extreme difirefs and defp air ^ from a feeling 
cf their fituati on ^ and regret at being torn from their friends 
and connections ; many retain thofe impreiEons for a long 
timxe ; in proof of which, the flaves on board his fhip be- 
ing often heard in the night, making an howling melan- 
choly hoife, expreffive of extreme anguifb, he repeat- 
edly ordered the woman, who had been his interpreter, 
to inquire into the caufe. She difcovered it to be owing 
to their having dreamt they v/ere in their own country 
again^ and finding themfeives when awake, in the hold of 
a fave fmp. This exquifite fenfibility v/as particularly 
obfervable among the women, many of whom^ on fuch 
occafions, he found in hvfteric fits. 

The 



( 33 ) 

The foregoing defcrlption as far as relates to their de- Methods ©/ 
je£lion when brought on board, and the caufe of it is <-'o>'finmg, 
confirmed by Hall, Wilfon, Claxton, Ellifon, Towne, t!'^'J'l',//,^l 
and Faiconbridge, the latter of whom relates an inftance ewyw^//&(z«. 
of a young v/oman who cried and pined away after being 
brought on board, who recovered when put on fhore, 
and who hung herfelf when informed fhe was to be fe^at 
again to the fhip. 

Captain Hall fays, after the firft eight or ten of them 
corrte on board, the men are put into irons. They are 
linked two and two together by the hands and feet, in 
which fituation they continue till they arrive, in the 
Weft Indies, except fuch as may be ficlc, whofe irons 
are then taken off. The women however, he fays, are 
always loole* 

On being brought up in a morning, fays Surgeon 
Wilfon, an additional mode of fecuring them takes place, 
for to the (hackles of each pair of tnem there is a ring, 
through which is reeved a lar2;e chain, which locks them 
all in a body to ring-bolts faftened to the deck. 

The time of their coming up in the morning, if fair, 
is defcribed by Mr Towne to be between eight and 
nine, and the time of their remaining there to be till four 
in the afternoon, when they are again put below till the 
iiext morning. In the interval of being upon deck they 
are fed twice. They have alfo a pint of water allowed 
to each of them a day, which being divided is ferved out 
to them at two different times, namely, after their 
mealsi 

Thele meals, fays Mr. Faiconbridge, confift of rice, 
yams, and horfe-beans, with now and then a little beef 
and bread. After meals they are made to jump in their 
irons. This is called dancing by the flave-dealers. In 
every Jhip he has been defired to fiog fuch as would not 
jump. He had generally a cat of nine tails in his hand 
among the women, and the chief mate, he believes, ano- 
ther amons the men. 

E The 



( 34 ) 

Methods cf The parts, fays Mr. Claxton, {to continue the ac- 

«i>C'p-'"'^/i'ii- ^^'-^^^ on which their (hackles are faftened, are often 

/n^-, and ex- excoriated by the violent exercife they are thus forced to 

*Ycifmgthm.x.2k.Q^ of which they made many grievous complaints to 

him. \^ his fliip even thofe v^^ho had the flux, fcurvy, 

and fuch cedematous fwellings in their legs as made it 

painful to them to move at all, w^ere compelled to dance 

by the cat. 

He fays alfo that on board his (hip they fometimes 
fung^ but not for their amufement. The captain or- 
dered them to fing, and they fung fongs of forroiv. The 
rubje<5l of thefe fongs were their %vr etched fttuaiion^ arid 
the idea of never returning home* He recollects their 
very words upon thefe occafions. 

The above account of (hackling, melling, * dancing, 
and fmging the (laves, is allowed by all the evidences 
as far as they fpeak to the fame points, except by Mr. 
Falconbridge^ in whofe fhips the (laves had a pint and 
and half of w^ater per day. 

Mode nf On the fubje£l: of the (lowage and its confequences, 

nXhhu bad^"^* Trotter fays, that the (laves in the paiTage are fo 
eo/r,"tf^Ke;7ffi. crowded below, that it is impoilible to walkthrough 
them, without treading on them. Thefe, who are out of 
irons, are locked fpoonways (in the technical phrafe) to one 
another. It is the firft mate's duty to fee them (towed 
in this way every morning 5 thofe who do not get quick* 
\y into their places, are compelled by a cat-of-nine'tails. 
When the fcuttles are obliged to be (hut, the gratings 
are not fufficient for airing the rooms. He never him^ 
felf could . breathe freelyj unlefs immediately under the 
hatchway. He has k^n the (laves drawing their breath 
with all thofe laborious and anxious efforts for life, 
which are obferved in expiring animals^ fuhjeoted by experi^ 
ment to foul air^ or in the exhaiifted receiver of an air pump. 
He has alfo feen them when the tarpawlings have 
inadvertently been thrown over the gratings, atempting 
to heave them up ; crying out in their own language, 
" We are dying v'' on removing the tarpawlings and

being brought hither, or on the deck ; others were ir- 
recoverably loft, byjuffocation^ having had no previous Jigns 
eifindifpofitior. 

Mr. Falconbridge alfo ftates on this head, that when em- 
ployed in flowing the Haves he made the moft of the room 
and wedged them in. They had not fo much room (^s a man 
in his coffin either in length or breadth. It was impoflible 
for them to turn or fhift with any degree of eafe. He 
had often occafion to go from one fide of their rooms to 
the other, in which cafe he always took offhisjhoes^ but 
could not avoid pinching them ; he has the marks on 
his feet where they bit and fcratched him. In every 
voyage when the (hip was full they complained of heat 
and want of air. Confinement in this fituation was fo 
injurious, that he has known them ^^ down apparently in 
good health at night and found dead in the mornings On 
his laft voyage he openedT a flout man who fo died. He 
found the contents of the thorax and abdom.en healthy, 
and therefore concludes he died of fuffocation in the night. 

He was never among them for ten minutes beloW 
together, but his fhirt Vv^as as wet as if dipt in water. 

One of his ihips, the Alexander, coming out of Bonny, 
got aground on the bar, and was detained there fix or 
iQYtn days, with a great fwell and heavy rain. At this 
time the air ports were obliged to be fhut, and part of 
the gratings on the weather fide covered : almoft all the 
men flaves were taken ill with the flux. The lafl: time 
he went down to fee them it was fo hot that he took ofF 
his fhirt. More than twenty of them had then fainted^ or 
were fainting. He got, however, feveral of them bawled 
on deck. Two or three of thefe died^ and moll of the 
reft before they reached the Wefl: Indies. He was 
down only about fifteen minutes, and becam.e fo ill by 
it that he could not get up without help, and was di fabled

Jkoes by the furgeons as defer i bed above, that they might 
not hurt them in traverfm^ their rooms, are additionally 
mentioned by Surgeons Wilfon and Claxton. The 
flaves are faid alfo by Hall and Witfon to cornplain on 
account of heat. Both Hall, Towne, and Morley, de- 
fcribe them as often in a violent per/piration^ or dew 
Jweat, Mr. Ellifon has {t<tn them faint through heat^ 
and obliged to be brought on deck, the fteam coming up 
through the gratings like a furnace. In Wilfon's and 
Towne's ihips fome have gone below well in an evening^ 
and in the ?norning have been found dead^ and Mr. Newton 
has often fe?n a dead and Hving man chained together^ 
and to ufe his own words, one of the pair dead.

To prove that this ftowage, and of courfe that the 
^^■vrndky^ confequences of it, muft unavoidably be as defcribed by 
another jpc the Gentlemen above, the following fpecies of evi- 
aes oj proof, ^jej^^e and calculation liiay be reforted to. 

Captain Parrey oftheFoyal Navy was fentby Govern- 
ment in the year 1788, to meafure fuch of the flave vef- 
fels as were then lyir^g at Liverpool, and to make a report 
of the fame to the Houfe of Commons. In this Re- 
port are mentioned the names of the different veflels, 
and their refpedtive dimenfions as taken by him. The 
firft of thefe, as delivered in by himfelf, is the Brookes, 
and as fome one fhip muft be taken to make out the 
proof intended, it will be lefs objectionable to take the 
iirfr that comes than any other. The dimenfions then 
of the Brookes as reported by Captain Parrey will b^ 
found as la the annexed Plans.

Let it now be fuppofed that the above are the reai 
dimenfions of the fhip Brookes, and farther, that every 
man flave is to be •allowed fix feet by one foot four incbes 
for room, every woman five feet ten by one foot four, 
every boy five feet by one foot two, and every girl four 
feet fix by one foot, it will follow that the annexed Plan 
of a fiave-veflei will be precifeiy the reprefentation of 
the (hip Brookes^ and of the exa6t number of perfons 

neither 



( 3S ) 

ihh mode neither more nor lefs, that could be flowed in the dif- 
tqucnfc7"m- f"^^^"^ rooms of it upon thefe data. Thefe, if counted, 
firmed by (*dedu6iing the women flowed in Z of P'igures VI. and 
emthirfpc VII.) will be found to amount to four hundred and fifty ^ 
auoj^roQf. ^^^^ Now, if it be confidered that the fhip Brookes is 
of 320 tons, and that fhe is allowed to carry by Ad; 
pf Parliament four hundred and fifty-four perfonsy it is 
evident that if three more could be wedged among the 
number reprefented in the plan, this plan would contairi 
precifely the number which the Adl diredls ; and if it 
ihould be farther confidered that there ought to be in 
each apartment in the plan one or jiiore tubs, as well as 
flanchions to fupport the platforms and decks, for which 
no dedudtion has been made, in order to give every pof- 
li|)le advantage in flowing, then the above plan may be 
confidered as giving a very favourable reprefentation of 
the flowing of the negroes even fmce the late regulating 
A51* The plan therefore abundantly proves that the 
flowage of thefe poor people as well as the confequences 
of it mufl have been as defcribed by the Evidences 
above ; for, if when four hundred and fifty-one flaves 
are put into the different rooms of the Brooks, the floors 
are not only covered with bodies, but thefe bodies actual- 
ly touch each other, what mufl have been their fituation, 
when fix hundred were ftowed in them at the time al- 
luded to bv Dr. Trotter, who belonged to this fhip, and 
fix hundred and nine by the confeflion of the flave-- 
meichants in a fubfequent voyage f. 
Jmidenfs on To come now to the different incidents on the paflage. 
^^T^U^^' Mr. Falconbridge fays, that there is a place in every fhip 

*By the late A£l of Parliament the fpace Z, -which is half of the half- 
deck, M Z is appropriated to tbe feamen. 

+ The fituation of the ilaves mull- be dreadf«l even on the prefent re- 
gulated plan ; for their bodies not only touch each other, but many of 
them have not even room to fit upright; for when every deduftion has 
been made, the height above the platform D F H, Fig. I. and below it 
C E G, is in the Brooks but two feet feveri inches. The average height 
in nine other veffels meafured by Captain Parrey was only five feet two 
inches ; and in the Venus and Kitty the flaves had not two feet above 
or below the platforms. The flaves immediately under the beams muf^ 
be in a flill more dreadful fituation as is feen by the plan ; for in Fig, I.' 
under the upper deck P P, and lower deck A A. thefe beams are repre- 
fented by iliaded fo[uares, as alfo they are introduced in Fig, 11. and III.

them, for they lie on the bare planks.^ He has k^n fre- '^^ ^^-^^^ 
quently the prominent parts of their bones about the 
ihoulder-blade and knees bare. 

He fays he cannot conceive any fituation fo dreadful 
and difgufting as that of ilaves when ill of the flux : ia 
the Alexander, the deck was covered with blood and mucusy 
and refembled a flaughter-houfe. The ftench and foul 
air were intolerable. 

The Ilaves, fhackled together, frequently quarrel. In 
each apartment there are three or four tubs placed for 
their convenience : thofe however at a diftance find it 
difficult to get over other ilaves to thefe tubs : fometimes 
if one wants to go to them, his companion refufes to go 
with him ; if relaxed, he exonerates while difputing over 
his neighbours. This caufes great difturbance. 

He has known feveral flaves on board refufe fuftenance^ "* 
With a defign to Jiarve thernfehes, Compulfion was ufed 
rn every fhip he was in to make them take their food* 
He has known alfo many inftances of their refufing to 
tak^ medicines when fick, becaufe they wifhed to die, A. 
woman on board the Alexander, was dejected from the 
moment fhe came on board, and refufed both food and 
medicine : being afl<:ed by the interpreter what fhe wanted, 
ihe replied, nothing but to die — and Ihe did d.\Q, Manj 
other (laves expreffed the famewifh. 

The fhips, he fays, t^xq fitted iJp with a view to prevejit 
ilaves jumping overboard ; notwithf!:anding which he has 
known inftances of their doing fo. In the Alexander two 
were loft in this way. In the fame voyage, near twenty 
jumped overboard out of the Enterprize, Capt. Wilfon, 
and feveral from a large Frenchman in Bonny River. 

in his firfl voyage he faw at Bonny, on board the 
Emilia, a woman chained to the deck, who, the chief 
mate faid, was mad. On his fecond voyage, there was 
a woman on board his own fhip, whom they were forced 
to chain at certain times. In a lucid interval £be was 
fold at Jamaica. He afcribes this infanity to their being 
torn from their connections and country,

i^gFajagc. ^^^^ ^^g ^^^ ^^^j^ ^jj.j^ j^-g family for witchcraft, (of which 

be had been accufed, out of revenge^ by a Caboflieer, p. 1 1 ) 
refufed all fuflenance after he came on board. Early 
next morning it was found he had attempted to cut his 
throat. T)r. Trotter fewed up the wound, but the fol- 
lowing night the man had not only torn out the futures, 
but had made a fimilar attempt on the other fide. From 
the ragged edges of the wound, and the blood upon his 
linger ends, it appeared to have been done with his nails, 
for though flri(St fearch was made through all the rooms, 
noinftrument was found. He declared he never would go 
with white ?nen^ uttered incoherent fentences, and looked 
wifhfully at the fkies. His hands were fecured, but 
perjlfting to refufe all fujienancey he died of hunger in eight 
©r ten days. 

He rem.embers alfo an inftance of a woman who perijfhec! 
from refufmg food : fhe was repeatedly flogged, and vic- 
tuals forced into her mouth, but no means could make her 
fwallow it, and fhe lived for the four laft days in a ftate 
©f torpid infenfibility. 

A man jumped overboard, at Anamaboe, and was 
drowned. Another alfo, on the Middle Pafiage, but he 
was taken up. A woman alfo, after having been taken 
up, was chained for fome time to the mizen maft, but 
being let loofe again made a fecond attempt, was again 
taken up, and expired under the floggings given her in 
confequence. 

Mr. AVilfon, fpeaking alfo on the fame fubjeffl:, relates^ 
among many cafes where force was necejfary to oblige the 
flaves to take food, that of a young man. He had not 
been long on board before he perceived him get thin. 
On inquiry he found the man had not taken his food, and 
refufed taking any. Mild means were then ufed to divert 
him from his refolution, as well as promifes that he fhould 
have any thing he wifhed for : but ftill he refufed to eat. 
. They then whipped him with the cat, but this alfo was 
inefFecbual. He always kept his teeth fo faft, that it was 
impoflible to get any thing down. They then endea- 
voured to introduce a Speculum Oris between them : 

but 



( 41 ) 

but the points were too obtufe to enter, and next tried ^^'^^'^^f^jj^ 
a bolus knlfe^ but with the fame efFe6t. In this ftate he ^ *** 
was for four or five days, when he was brought up as 
dead, to be thrown overboard ; but Mr. Wilfon finding 
life ftill exifi:Ing, repeated his endeavours though in vain, 
and two days afterwards he was brought up again in the 
fame ftate as before. He then feemed to wifh to get up. 
The crew alTifted him, and brought him aft to the fire 
place, when in a feeble voice, in his own tongue he afked 
for water, which was given him. Upon this they began 
to have hopes of difTuading him from his defign, but he 
again fhut his teeth as fall as ever, and rejohed to die^ 
and on the ninth day from his firft refufal he died> 

Mr. Wilfon fays it hurt his feelings much to be 
obliged to ufe the cat fo frequently to force them to take 
their food. In the very a6l of chaftifement, they have 
looked up at him with a fmile, and in their own language 
have faid, " prefently we Jhall be no more,^' 

In the fame fhip a woman found means to convey below 
the night preceding fome rope-yarn, which fhe tied to thoi 
head of the armourer's vice, then in the women's room. 
She faftened it round her neck, and in the morning was 
found dead, with her head lying on her fhoulder, whence 
it appeared, fhe muft have ufed great exertions to ac- 
complifh her end. A young woman alfo hanged herfelf^ 
by tying rope-yarns to a batten, near her ufual lleeping- 
place, and then flipping off the platform. The next 
morning fhe was found warm, and he ufed the proper 
means for her recovery, but in vain. 

In the fame fhip alfo, vv'hen off Annabona, a flave on 
the fick lift jumped overboard, and was picked up by the * 

natives, but died foon afterwards. At another time, when 
at fea, the captain and officers Vv^hen at dinner, heard the 
alarm of a flave's being overboard, and found it true, for 
they perceived him making every exertion to drown him- 
fclf. He put his head under water ^ but lifted his hands up i 
and thus went down, as if exulting that he had got away, 

Befides the above inftance, a man flave who came on 
board apparently well, became afterwards mad, and at 
length died infane. 

F Mr. 



( 42 ) 

Ivci.lentson J^j*. Cbxton, the fourth furgeon examined on theTe 
ihcPajage, points, declares the fl-eeraiie and boys room to have been 
infufficie-^t to rec eive the Tick ; they were therefore ob- 
liged to place together thofe that were, and thofe that were 
not difeafed, and in confequence the difeafe and mortality 
fpread more and more. The captain treated them with 
more tendernefs than he has heard was ufual, but the 
men were not humane. Some of the mofl difeafed were 
obliged to keep on deck with a fail fpread for them to lie 
on. This, in a little time, became nearly covered with 
blood and mucui^ v/hich involuntarily iffued from them, 
and therefore the failors, who had the difagreeable tafk 
of cleaning the fail, grew angry with the flaves, and 
ufed to beat them inhumanly with their hands, or with a 
cat. The flaves in confequence grew fearful of commit- 
ting this involuntary action, and when they perceived 
they had done it, would immediately creep to the tubs, 
and there fit draining with fuch violence, as to produce 
a prolapfus ani^ which could not be cured. 

Some of the flaves on board the fame fhip, fays Mr. 
Claxton, had fuch an averjion to leaving their native 
places^ that they threw themfelves overboard, on an idea 
t\\2it ihi'y Jhoidd get back to their ovjn cou72try. The captain, 
in order to obviate this idea, thought of an expedient, 
viz. to cut off the heads of thofe who died, intimating 
to them,, that if determined to go, they mufl return 
without their heads. The flaves were accordingly brought 
up to witnefs the operation. One of them feeing, when on 
deck, the carpenter Handing with his hatchet up ready to 
ftrikeofFthe head of a dead flave,with a violent exertion got 
loofe, and flying to the place where the nettings had been 
unloofed, in order to empty the tubs, he darted overboard. 
The fhip brought to, and a man was placed in the mairt 
chains to catch him, which he perceiving, dived under 
water, and rlfing again at a difbance from the jfhip, made 
figns, w^hlch words cannot defcribe, exprejjive of his hap^ 
pinefs in efcaping. He then went down, and was feen no 
more. This circumftance deterred the captain from 
trying the expedient any more, and therefore he refolved 
for the future (^5 he jaw they were determined to throiv them" 
felves overboard) to keep a ikxKi v/atch 5 notwithilanding 

whichj 



( 43 ) 

which, fome afterwards contrived to unloofe the lafhlng, J^ddenfsm 
fo that two actually threw themfelves into the fea, and ^'^^ ■^''-^^•^''* 
were loft ; another was caught when about three parts 
overboard. 

All the above incidents, defcribed as to have happened 
qn the Middle Pailage, are amply corroborated by the 
other evidences. The jlaves lie on the hare hoards^ fays 
furgeoii Wilfon. They 2iYQ frequently bru'.fed^ tlvA the 
prominent parts of the body excoriated^ adds the fame 
gentleman, as alfo Trotter and Newton. Their being 
linked together^ their quarrelling^ and the difficulty of fietting 
to their tubs^ are additionally mentioned by Hall and 
Nev/ton. They have been feen by Morley walhwinv in 
their blood and excrement* Claxton, Ellifon, and Hall 
defcribe them as refufing fuftenance, and compelled to eat 
by the whip. Morley has {^tn the pannekin dafhed 
againft their teeth, and the rice held in their mouths, to 
make them fwallowit, till they v/ere almoft ftrangled, and 
they have even been thumhfcrewed * with this view in the 
{hips of Town and Millar. 

The man alfo, fays the former, ftolen at Galenas 
River, (p. 8.) refufed to eat, 2inA per ftfied till he died. 

A woman, fays the latter, who was brought on board, 
refufed fuftenance, neither would ihe fpealc. She was 
then ordered the thumb-fcrews, fufpended in the mizea 
rigging, and QVQ'cy attempt was made with the cat to com- 
pell her to eat, but to no purpofe. She died in three or four 
days afterwards. Mr, Millar was told that ihe had faid 
the night before fhe died, '' She was going to her friends. ^^ 

As a third fpccific inftance, in another veflel, may be 
mentioned that related by Mr. Ifaac Parker. There was 
a child, fays he, on board, of nine months old, which 
refufed to eat, for which the captain took it up in his 
hand, and flogged it with a cat, faying at the fame time,

Inddrntson " Damn you, I'll make you eat, or I'll kill you." The 
the Pafage. fame child having fwelled feet, the captain ordered them 
■ to be put into water, thou^rh the Jlnp^s cock told him it was 
too hot. This brought off the fkin and nails. He then 
ordered fweet oil and cloths, which Ifaac Parker himfelf 
applied to the feet; and as the child at mefs time again 
refufed to eat, the ca^^taid again took it up and flogged 
it, and tied a log of mango-wood eighteen or twenty 
inches long, and of twelve or thirteen pounds weight 
round its neck, as a punifhment. He repe^ited the flogging 
for four days together at mefs time. The laft time after 
flogging it, be let it drop out of his hand, with the fame 
expreflion as before, and accordingly in about three 
quarters of an hour the child died. He then called its 
mother to heave it overboard, and beat her for refufing. 
He however forced her to take it up, and go to the fhip's 
fide, where holding her head on one fide to avoid the fight^ 
Jhe dropped h^r child overboard^ after which /he cried for 
many hours, 

Befides inflances of flaves refufing to eat, with the vlev7 
of deRroying themfelves, and dying in confequence of it, 
thofe of their going rnad^ are confirmed by Town, and of 
their jumping cverboa^ d, or attempting to do it, by Town, 
Millar, Ellifon, and Hall. 

Other incidents on the palTage, mentioned by fome of 
the evidences in their examination, may be divided into 
three kinds. 

The firfl kind confifts of infurre^lions on the part of the 
flaves. Some of thefe frequently attempted to rife, but 
were prevented, (Wilfon, Town, Trotter, Newton, 
Dalrymple, Ellifon,) others rofe, but were quelled, 
(Ellifon, Newton, Falconbridge,) and others rofe, and 
fucceeded, killing almofl all the whites : (Falconbridge 
and Town). — Mr. Town fays, that inquiring of the 
flaves into the caufe of thefe infurre6lions, he has been 
afked, what bifinefs he had to carry them from their country, 
'They had wives and children^ whojn they wanted to be with. 

After 



( 4S ) 

After an infurre£lion, Mr. Elllfon fays, he has feen LuidefHs w 
them flogged, and the cook's tormrntors and tongs heated ^b<:^^JP^g^- 
to bun ihfir flejh, Mr. Newton alfo adds, that it is 
ufual for captains, after infurre6lions and plots happen, to 
£og the {laves. Some captains, on board whofe {hips he 
has been, added the thumb-fcrew, and one in particular 
told him repeatedly that he hadput Jlaves to death after an 
injurreBion by various modes of torture. 

The fecond fort of incident on the pafTage is men- 
tioned by Mr. Falconbridge in the inftance of an Englifh 
vefTel blowing up off Galenas, and moft of the men-flaves, 
entangled in their irons^ ■perijlnng. 

The third fort is defcribed by Mr. Hercules Rofs as 
follows. One infbance, fays he, marked with peculiar 
circumftances of horror, occurs : — About tw.enty years 
ago, a fhip from Africa, with about four hundred flaves 
on board, ftruck upon feme fhoals, called the Morant 
Keys, diftant eleven leas;ues, S. S. E. off the Eaft 
end of Jamaica. The officers and feamen of the fhip 
landed in their boats, carrying with them arms and pro- 
vifions. The {laves were left on board in their irons and 
fhackles. This happened in the night time. The 
Morant Keys confifl of three fmall fandy iflands, and he 
underflood that the fhip had {truck upon the fhoals, at 
about half a league to windward of them. When morn- 
ing came, it was difcovered that the negroes had got 
out of their irons, and were bufy making rafts, upon 
v/hich they placed the wom.en and children, whilfl the? 
men, and others capable of fwimming, attended upon 
the rafts, whilfl they drifted before the wind towards the 
if] and where the feamen had landed. From an appre- 
henfion th.at the negroes would confume the water and 
provifions which the feamen bad landed, they cam^e to 
the refolution of deftroying them, by means of their 
fire-arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches 
approached the fliore, they actually deflroyed between three 
and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only 
thirty-three or thirty- four zuere faved^ and brought to 
Kingfton, where Mr, Rofs faw them fold at public 

vendue.

^fcf- configned to a Mr. Hugh Wallace, of the pariili of St. 
Elizabeth's. 

Mr. Rofs fays, in extenuation of this malTacre, that 
the crew were probably drunk, or they would not have 
a6led fo, but he does not know it to have been the c?ife. 

Mamernf When the fliips arrive at their dedined ports, the 

•ttLtX-^-'-'^^" ^^^ ^^P^^^^ ^^ ^^^^- They are fold either by 
eda/ihe fcramble or by vendue, (i. e.) publick au6lion, or by 
fiejiinedpcris.lots. The fale by fcran^.ble is thus defcribed by Mr. 
Falconbridge. " In the Emilia, (fays he) at Jamaica, 
the ihip was darkened with fails, and covered round. 
The men flaves were placed on the main deck, and the 
women on the quarter deck. The purchafers on fhore 
were informed a gun would be fired when they were 
ready to open the fale. A great number of people came 
on board v^^ith tallies or cards in their hands, with their 
own names upon them, and rufhed through, the barricado 
door with the ferocity of brutes. Some had three or 
four handkerchiefs tied together, to encircle as many as 
they thought fit for their purpofe. In the yard at Gre- 
nada, he adds, (where another of his fliips, the Alexander, 
fold by fcramble) the women v/ere fo terrified, that feveral 
of them got out of the yard, and ran about St. George's 
tov/n as if they were mad. In his fecond voyage, v/hiie 
lying at Kingfton, he faw a fale by fcramble on board the 
Tryal, Captain Macdonald. Forty or fifty of the flaves 
leaped into the fea, all of v/hich, however, he believes, 
were taken up again." This is a very general mode of 
fale. Mr. Baillie fay?, it Vv'as the common mode in 
America Vv'here he has been. Mr. Fitzmaurice has been 
at twenty fales by fcramble in Jamaica. Mr. Clappefon 
never faw any other mode of fale during his refidence 
there, and it is mentioned as having been pradlifed under 
the infpedlion of Morley and of Trotter. 

The fiaves fold by publick auction or vendue are 
generally the rcfufe^ or fickly flaves. Thefe are in fuch 
a fcate of health, that they fell, fays Baillie, greatly 
under price, Falconbridge has known them fold for 

five 



( 47 ) 

f'ue dollars each^ Town for a Guinea^ and Mr. Hercules 
Rofs as low as a fingle dollar. 

The ftate of fuch is defcrlbed to be very deplorable by DcpWahh 
General Tottenham and Mr. Hercules Rofs. The for-/^"«^'^^"^/ 
mer fays, that he once obferved at Barbadoes a number S/!' "^f^ J** 
of Haves that had been landed from a (hip. They were 
brought into 'the yard adjoining the place of fale. Thofe 
that were not very ill were put into little huts, and thofe 
that were worfe were left in the yard to die, for nobody 
gave the?}! any thing to eat or drink ; ami fome of them lived 
three days in that Jitv.ation. The latter has frequently kQi\ 
the very refi^fe (as they are termed) of the Haves of Guinea 
fliips landed and carried to the vendue-mafters in a very 
wretched ftate ; fometimes in the agonies of death ; and 
he has known inftances of their expiring in the piazza of 
the V endue -niafter. 

Mr. Newton fays, that in none of the fales he Scpa'-aiion s/ 
faw was there any care ever taken to prevent fuch flaves '■'''^^'"'-'" «"^ 
as were relations from being feparated. They were fepa -•"'"'"' ^' 
rated as fheep and lambs by the butcher. This feparation 
of relations and friends is confirmed by Davifon, Trotter, 
Clappefon, and Town. Fitzmaurice alfo mentions the 
fame, v/ith an exception only to infants ; but Mr. Fal- 
conbridge fays, that one of his captains (Frazer) recom- 
mended it to the planters never to feparate relations and 
friends. He fiys he once heard of a perfon refufmg to 
purchafe a man's wiTe, and was next day informed the 
man had hanged hirnfelf.

490, and loft 180 ; Fllifon, in three voyages, where he 
recolle^Sls the mortality, bought 895, and loft 356. In 
one of thefe voyages, fays the latter, the flaves had the 
fmall-pox. In this cafe he has feen the platform one

Mr. Morley fays, that in four voyages he purchafed 
about T325, and loft about 313. Mr. Town, in two 
voyages, 630, and loft 115. Mr. C!axton, in one 
voyage, 250, and loft 132. In this voyage, he fays, 
they v^ere fo ftreightened for provifions, that if they had 
been ten more days at fea, they muft either have eaten 
the Haves that died, or have made the living flaves walk 
the plank^ a term in ufe among Guinea cai)tains for making 
the Jlaves throw themj elves overboard. He fays alfo, that 
he fell in with the Hero, Captain Withers, vi^hich had 
loft 360 flaves, or more than half her cargo, by the 
fmall-pox. The furgeon of the Hero told him, that 
when the flaves were removed from one place to another, 
they left marks of their fkin and blood upon the decky and it 
was the moft horrid fight he had ever feen. 

Mr, Wllfon ftates, that in his fhip, and three others, 
belonging to the fame concern, they purchafed among 
them 2064 flaves, and loft- 586. He adds, that he fell 
in witb the Hero, Captain Withers, at St. Thomas's, 
which had loft 159 flaves by the fmall-pox. Capt. Hall, 
in two voyages, purchafed 550, and loft no. He adds, 
that he hr.s known fome fhips in the flave trade bury a 
quarter.^ fome a thirds and others half of their cargo. It 
ts very uucomfnon to find /hips ivithout fome lofs * in their 
Jlaves. 

Befidcs thofe which die on the paflage, it muft be no- 
ticed here that feveral die foon after they are fold. Six- 
teen, fays Mr= Falconbridge, were fold by audlion out 
of the Alexander, all of whom died before the ftiip left the 
Weft Indies. Out of fourteen, fays Mr. Claxton, fold 
from his ihip in an infe(fl:ious ftate, only four lived -y and 
though in the four voyages mentioned by Mr. Wilfon no 
lefs than 586 periftied on the paflage out of 2064, yet 

* Total purchafed 7904, loft 2053, exclufive of the Hero, being above 
one-fourth of the number purchafed. The reader will obferve, that Mr. 
€la.x-ton fell ii\ with the Hero on one voyage, and Mr. Wilfon en another,

( 49 ) 

^20 additionally died of the fmall-pox in a very littls* 
time after their delivery in the river Plate, making the total 
iofs for thofe ihips not lefs than 83b, oat of 2,064. 

The caufes of the diforders which carry off the flaves ^'^"h'^f^^^^ 
in fuch numbers, are afcribed >y Mr. Falconbridge to 2i^°^^^' '^-^^ 
difeafed mind^ fudden tranjttions from heat to cold^ a putrid 
atmofphere^ zvallowing in their ovjn excrements^ and being 
Jhackled together. A difeafed mind, he fays, is undoubt- 
edly one of the caufes ; for many of the llaves on board 
refufed medicines, giving as a reafon that they wanted 
to die^ and could never be cured. Some few on the 
other hand, who did not appear to think fo much of their 
Jituation^ recovered^ That (hackling together is alfo 
another caufe, was evident from the circumfliance of the 
men dying in tzvice the proportion the women did ; and 
fo long as the trade continues, he adds, they muji he 
jfhackled together, for no man will attempt to carry them 
out of irons. 

Surgeon Wilfon, examined on the fame topick, fpeaks 
nearly in the fame manner. He fays, that of the death of 
two-thirds of thofe who died in hisfiiip, the primary caufe 
was 'melancholy. This was evident not only from the fymp- 
toms of the diforder, and the circumftance that no one who 
had it was ever cured^ whereas thofe who had it not^ and 
yet were ill, recovered^ but from the language of the 
flaves thehifelves, who declared that they wijioed to die^ as 
alfo from Ciptain Smith's own declaration, v/ho faid, their 
deaths were to be afcribed to their thinking fo WMch of their 
Jituation, Though feveral died of the flux, he attributes 
their death primarily to the caufe before affigned ; for, 
fays he, their original diforder was a fixed melancholy^ 
and the fymptoms lownefs of fpirits and defpondency. 
Hence they refufed food. This only increafed the fymp- 
toms. The ftomach afterwards got weak. Hence the 
belly ached, fluxes enfued, and they were carried oiF. 

Mr. Town, the only other perfon, who fpeaks of the 
caufes of the diforders of the flaves, fays, " they often fall 
fick, fometimes owing to their crowded ftate, but ?noJ}ly 
to grief for being carried away from thnr country and 

G frimds'\ 



( so ) 

friends^^* This he knows from inquiring frequently 
(which he was enabled to do by underftanding their 
langua2;e) into the circumftances of their grievous com- 
plaints *, 

Opinions of As the trade may be faid to end on the delivery of the 
fcveral of the flaves in the Weft Indies, it may not be improper to 
iik'Trader ^^^^^ ^^^ Opinion of fome of the Evidences concern- 
ing it. 

Mr. XVIlfon Rates, that his reafon for quitting his 
iate employment was, that he did not like to continue 
in a trade, that did not perfectly coincide with his ideas, 
and was not to his fatisfa^iion, being obliged to make ufe 
of means for the preferva«-ion of the cargo, contrary to his 
feelings^ andfenfe of humanity* 

Mr. Falconbridge declares, that In his firft and fecond 
\^oyage he reflected but little on the juftice or injuftice 
of the trade. In his lail voyage he reflected more, and 
the more he did fo^ the more he was convinced it w^-S ^n 
unnatural^ iniquitous^ and villainous trade^ and he could 
not reconcile it to his confcience. This was the reafon 
for his leaving it. He adds, that he believes at the time 
he left it, he could have gone again with Capt. Frazer, 
if he had chofen itj and he was afterwards repeatedly fo~> 
iicited to go to the Gold Coaft by Captain Thompfon. 

Captain Wilfon declares from the whole of his ex- 
perience, as an impartial man^ he has long fince formed 
an opinion, [which each fucceeding day's experience has juf-- 
iified and confirmed) that it is a trade evidently /52/«^^^ 
en injupiice and treachery^ ma7r,feftly carried on by oppref- 
Jion and cruelty^ and not unfrequently terminating in 
murdir^ 

* It Is evl<leiit from hence, that m Regulation of the Trade can heal 
the evils m this branch of the fubjed. It can never cure melancholy or d 
difeafed mind. It cati never prevent an hjjw'ed people from rl/ing If out of 
irom, nor can it take away corrupted air, unlefs it reduce the number! 
to be carried fo low, as not to make it worth the while of the llave- 
aierchants to tranfport them. 

Captain

Captain Hall makes a declaration alfo, that when he '^/'W"'" af 
left the trade he could have obtained the conrimand q^ f'^"^^^ °f ^^?- 
a fhip in it, which command at that time would have turrade,^ 
been a very lucrative one^ but that he quitted '\tfro?n 
a conviolion that it was perJeSfly illegal^ and founded in

Conliltently witn this definition we nnd the evidence al- 
ferting with one voice, that they " have no legal pro-

treatment varies according to the diipofition of their 
Mafters." If their mafters be good men, fays the Dean of 
Middleham, they are well ofFj but^ if notj they fufFer, 

The 



( S3 ) 

The general treatment, however, is defcribed to be Ytrj Afp^^^'^h 
fevere. Some fpeak more moderately than others upon '^Q'^ Tmeral 
it, but all concur in the general ufage as being bad. Mr. Eflimathn 
Woolrich, examined upon this point, fays, that he never ^"'^ Treats 
knew the belt maftsr in the W. Indies uie his Haves fo '^"''* 
well as the worft mafter his fervants in England; that their 
flate is inconceivable ; that it cannot be defcribed to the 
fall underflanding of thofe v/ho have never Teen it, and 
that a fight of feme gangs would convince more than 
all vv^ords. Others again make ufe of the vrords, 
" ufed with great cruelty,— like be"afts, or v/orfe:" and 
the Dean of i^*4iddieham5 after balancing in his mind all 
his knowledge upon this fubje(5^, cannot fay, (fetting 
afide on one hand particular inflances of great feverity, 
^nd on the other hand particular infiances of great hu- 
manity) that treatment altogether humane and proper 
was the lot of fuch as he had either obferved or heard of. 

To come to a more particular defcription of their ^^'^^'^^^ f^ 
treatment, it will be proper to divide them into different ^^,^'[^^''^^^^"' ' 
claffes. The firft may be faid to confift of thofe -^^''tiQ and mt-dm^ 
are bought for the plantation ufe. Thefe will be arti-y^'^'^^^- 
ficers of various defcrlptions, and the * field flaves.— 
The fecond will confift of what may be termed In-or 
Out-door JIaves. The former are dom.efticks both in 
tov/n and country, and the latter porters, fiiliermen, 
boatmen, and the like.

are called out by day-light to their work. For this pur-^^^^''^-^!"'"^ 
pofe the (hell blows, and they hurry into the field. If ^" ' 
they are not there in time they are flogged. When put 
to their work, they perform it in rows, and without ex^ 
ception under the whip of drivers^ a certaisj number of , 
whom are allotted to each gang. By thefe means the 
weak are made to keep up with the flrong. Mr. Fitz- 
maurice is forry to fay, that from this caufe many of * 

them are hurried to the grave, as the able, even if 

* Among thefe are agala included v/atchmen, drivers, and head-, 
negroes.

{ 54 ) 

Labour of placed with the weakly to bring them up, will leave? 
ihefeld them behind, and then the weakly are generally flogged 
Jlavcsoutof yp ^y ji^g driver This, however, is the mode of their 
labour. As to the time of it, they begin, as before faid, 
at day-light, and continue, with two intermiilions, (one 
for half an hour in the morning, and the other for two 
hours at noon) till fun-fet. 

The above defcription, however, does not include the 
whole of their operations for the day, for it is expe6i:ed 
that they fhall range about and pick grafs for the cattle. 
It is clear, from the different evidences, that the cuftom 
of grafs-picking varies, as to the time in which it is to 
be done, on different eftates, for on fome it is to be done 
within the intervals of reft faid to be allowed at noon, and 
on others after the labour of the day. It is complained of, 
however, in either cafe, as a great grievance, inafmuch 
as it lengthens the time of work ; as alfo becaufe, par- 
ticularly in droughts, it is very difficult to find grafs at 
all, and becaufe if they do not bring it in fufficient 
quantities, they are punifhed. Grafs-picking, fays Capt. 
Smith, is one of the moft frequent caufes of punifliment. 
He has feen fome flogged for not getting fo great a 
quantity of it as others, and that at a tim.e, when he has 
thought it impojjible they could have gotten half the quantity,^ 
having been upon the fpot. 

'Hard cafe of It is impofJible to pafs over in filence the almoft total 
ihe Women want of indulgence which the women flaves frequently 
favss, experience during the operations in the field. It is 
allerted by Dalrymple, that the drivers in ufing their 
Vv^hip never diftinguifh fex. As to pregnant women, and 
fuch as had children, Mr. Davies believes they were allow- 
ed to come into the field a little later than the reft. They 
did little v/ork after they v/ere four months gone with 
child, in the experience of Mr. Duncan. Dr. Harrifon 
alfo has known fome overfeers allow complaining preg- 
nant women to retire from work., but be has feen them 
labouring in the field, when they feemed to have but a 
f«^w months to go : they were generally worked as long 
^.s abke Much the fame work^ fays Mr. Cook, was 

?xpe(Ste4 



{ 55 ) 

^xpe^ied from pregnant women as others. He has feen Hard cn/e cf 
them holing till within a few hours of their delivery, and ^^^ f^omea 
has known them receive thirty-nine lafhes while in this^'^^"* 
ilate. Mr. Woolrich thinks the pregnant vi^omen had 
fome little indulgencies, but it was cuftomary for them 
to work in the field till near their time. The whip was 
occafionally ufed upon them, but not fo feverely as upon 
the men. Mr. Rees obferving the gangs at work, faw 
a pregnant woman rather behind the reft. The driver 
called her to come on, and going back flruck her with 
the whip up towards her fhoulders. He afked another 
pregnant woman, if (he was forced to work like the reft, 
and fhe faid, Yes. Sir G. Young adds, that women 
were coniidered to mifcarry in general from their hard 
field labour; and Captain Hall fays, that, where they had 
children, they were fent again after the month to labour 
with the children upon their backs, and (o little time af- 
forded them to attend their wants, that he has feen a wo-^ 
man feated to give fuck to her child, roufed from that ft- 
tuation by a fevere blow from the cart whip,* 

The above accounts of the mode and duration of the ^/^^;,. j^^^,.^, 
labour of the iieid flaves, are confined to that feafon ofm the Crop 
the year which is termed, " Out of Crop," or the time ■^f'^"* 
in which they are preparing the lands for the crop. In 
the crop feafon, however, the labour is of much longer 
duration. Weakly handed eftates, fays Mr. Fitzmau- 
rice, which are far the moft numerous, form their negroes 
in crop into two fpelis, which generally change at twelve 
«t noon, and tv/elve at night. The boilers and others 
about the works, relieved at twelve at noon, cut canes 
from fhell-blow, (half paft one- till dark, when they 
carry cane -tops or grafs to the cattle penns, and then 
they may reft till twelve at night, when they relieve the 
fpell in the boiling- houfe, by which they themfelves had 
been relieved at twelve in the day. On all eftates the 
boiling goes on night and day without intermiilion : but 

-- In fome eftates, it is ufual to dig a hole in the ground, in which 
they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they 
may not excufe punilhmcnt, nor yet endanger the life of the woman or 
child. (Dr. Jackfon, Lieutenant Pavifon.)

hi the Crop accordingly. 

Seajon . 

Mr. DalrympIC) fpeaking alfo of their labour In time 
of crop, fays they are obliged to work as long as they can^ 
V/hich is as long as they can keep av/ake or ftand on 
their legs. Sometimes they fall afleep, through excefs 
of fatigue, when their arms are caught in the mill, and 
torn ofF. He faw feveral, who had loft their arms in 
that way. 

Mr. Cook ftates, on the fame fubje(^, that in crop- 
tlm^e they work in general about eighteen hours out of 
the twenty-four, and are often hurt through mere fatigue 
and want of Jleep. He knew a girl lofe her hand by the 
mill while feeding it, for being overcome by lleep, fhe 
dropped againft the rollers. He has heard of feveral in- 
ftances of this kind. 

Their days of rj^^ ^|^jg account of the labour of the flaves, both in 
^^ ' and out of crop, it muft be added here, that on fome 

eftates, it appears by the evidence, they have Sunday and 
Saturday afternoon out of crop to themfelves, that is, to 
cultivate their own grounds for their fupport; on others, 
Sunday only; and on others, Sunday only in part, for 
fome people, fays the Dean of Middieham, required 
meat for the cattle on Sundays to be gathered twice in 
the day; and Lieutenant Davifon fays he has known 
them forced to work on Sundays for their mailers. It 
appears again, that in crop, on no eftates, have they 
more than Sunday for the cultivation of their lands. 
The Dean of Middieham has known them continue 
boiling the fugar till late on Saturday night, and in one 
inftance remembers it to have been protracted till fun- 
rife on Sunday * morning : and the care afterwards of 
fetting up the fugar-jars muft have required feveral 
hours, 

* It appears, that they have three or four holidays in the year, but the 
Uays are not fpecified. 

Th<? 



( 57 ) 

The point, which may be confidered next, may be T'/^^/r Fcss*^* 
that of the flaves food. This appears by the evidence 
to be fubje(5t: to no rule. On fome eftates they are 
allowed land, which they cultivate for themfelves at the 
times mentioned above, but they have no provifions al- 
allowed them, except perhaps a fmall prefent of fait fi(h 
or beef, or fait pork, at Chriftmas. On others they are 
allowed provifions, but no land : and on others again 
they are allowed land and provifions jointly. Without 
enumeratinor the different ratios mentioned to be allowed 
them by the diiferent evidehv:es, it may be fufficient to 
take the higheft. The beft allowance is evidently at 
Barbadoes, and the following is the account of it. The 
flaves in general, fays General Tottenham, appeared to 
be ill fed : each flave had a pint of grain for twenty-four 
hours, and fometimes half a rotten herring Vv'hen to be 
had. When the herrings were unfit for the ^uhiies^ tl^y 
were bought up by the ' planters for the flaves. Mr, 
Davis fays, that on thofe eftates in Barbadoes where he 
has feen the flaves allowance dealt out, a grown negro 
had nine pints of corn, and about one pound of fait fifli 
a week, but the grain of the Weft-Indies is much lighter 
than v/heat. He is of opinion, that in general they were 
too fparingly fed. The Dean of Middleham alfo men- 
tions nine pints per v/eek as the quantity given, but that 
he has known mailers abridge it in the time of crop. 
This is the greateft allowance mentioned throughout the 
whole of the evidence, and this is one of the cafes in 
which the flaves had provifions but no land. Where, on 
the other hand, they have land and no provifions, all the 
evidences agree that it is quite ample to their fupport, but 
that they have not fufficient time to cultivate it. Their 
lands too are often at the diftance of three miles from their 
houfes, and Mr. Giles thinks the flaves were often fb 
fatigued by the labour of the v/eek as fcarcely to be capable 
of working in them on Sunday for their own ufe. It is alfo 
mentioned as a great hardfhip, that often when they had 
cleared thefe lands, their mafler has taken them away for 
canes, giving them new wood-land in their fiead, to be 
cleared afrefh» This circumflancej together with the 

H removal 



( 58 ) 

*Thar Food, removal of their houfes, many of them have fo taken to 
heart, as to have died. 

Whether or no their food may be confidered as fuf- 
ficient in general for their fupport, may be better feen 
from the following than the preceding account. Mr. 
Cook fays that they have not fufficient food. He has 
known both Africans and * Creoles eat the putrid carcafes 
of animals, and is convinced they did it through want* 
Mr. J. Terry has known them, on eftates ivhere they 
have been worfe fed than on c ^W?\f, eat the putrid carcafes 
of animals alfo. Dead mules, horfes, and cows, fays 
Mr. Coor, were all burnt under the infpeftion of a white 
man. Had they been buried, the negroes would have 
dug them up in the night to eat them through hunger. 
It was generally faid to be done to prevent the negroes 
from eating them, left it fhould breed difteinpers. 

Befides thefe, there are proofs of a different nature. 
Giles, Coor, Captain Giles, Captain Smith, Davifon, 
Duncan, Harrifon, and Dalrymple, agree, that many of 
the flaves in the Weft-Indies v/ere thieves^ but they all 
agree alfo in afTerting, that they ftole in confequence of 
hunger^ or being ill fed. The ufual objects of their theft 
are faid by Terry, Clappefon, Duncan, Harrifon, and the 
Dean of Middleham, to be provifions or food. Where 
they were well fed, on the other hand, fay Davifon and 
Captain Giles, they f did not JieaJy and, where they were 
ill fed, fay Terry and Duncan, they ftole at the very 
hazard of their lives. The Dean of Middleham and 
Harrifon confirm this, by ftating that feveral in confe- 
quence of attempting to fteal provifions, have been 

* AH thofe born in the t/Jands, are called Creoles. Some have attributed 
the eating of the putrid carcafes of animals to the vitiated tajie of the flaves, 
contradled in their o%vn cou77try, but the circumllance of thofe eating them, 
%vho are born in the iflands, totally difproves the allegation, and points 
out the real caufe as afiigned above, 

•}• There is a faying in the Weft Indies, " that you never fee a negro 
but you fee a thief;" — a faying which has a tendency to hart the negroes 
in the eftimacion of thofe who hear it, but which it is eafy to expiaia 
hom. the «ibove «iccouuis.

brought home wounded, and almofl cut to pieces, by 
the watchmen. 

On the fijbje6l of their clothing, there is the fameT'/t'^V 
variation as to quantity as in their food. It depends on^^^^'^^'^^* 
the difpofition and circumilances of their mafters. The 
largelt allowance in the evidence is that wnich is men- 
tioned by Dr. Harrifon. The men, he fays, at Chrlfimas, 
are allowed two 'rocks, and two pair of Ofnaburgh 
trowfers^ and the women two coats and two Shifts apiece. 
Some alfo have two handkerchiefs for the head. They 
have no other clothes than thefe. except they get them by 
their own extra labour. Woolrich and Coor agree, that 
as far as their experience went, the mafters did not expend 
for the clothing of their (lave? more than half a crown 
or three {hillings a year ; and Cook fays that they are in 
general but very indifferently clothed, and that one half of 
them go almofl naked in the fields 

With refpe^i: to their houses and lodging, the accounts TZwFo?^*j. 
of the three following gentlemen will fufHce. 

Mr. Woolrich ftates their houfes to be fmall fquare 
huts, built with poles, and thatched at the top and fides 
with a kind of bamboo, and built by the flaves themfelves. 
He defcribes them as lying in the middle of thefe huts 
before a fmall fire, but to have no bedding. Some, he 
fays, obtain a board or mat to lie on before the fire. 
A few of the head-flaves have cabins of boards raifed 
from the floor, but no bedding, except fome, who have 
a coarfe blanket. 

The Reverend Mr. Rees, defcribing their houfes nearly 
in the fame manner, obferves that their furniture confifts 
of ftools and benches, that they had no beds or bedding 
in the houfes he was in, but that fome of them flept on 
the ground, and others on a board raifed from it. 

Some of the new flaves, fays Dr. Harrifon, have a few 
blankets, but it is not the general pra6lice : for in general 
they have na bedding at all. 

Hz Of 



( 6o ) 

rhetr Of the property of the field Haves, (the next article 

Propcriy. ^q ^g confidered) the following teftimonies will give a 
fuiHcient illaftration. 

Many field flaves, fays Mr. Woolrlch, Have it not in 
their power to earn any taing, exclufive of their mafter's 
work. Som^ few raife fowls, and fome tew pigs, and fell 

them, but their number is very few. 

Mr. Dalrymple does not fliy, that ilaves never become 
pofTelTed of much property, but he never knew an inftance 
of it, nor can he conceive how they can have time for it. 

The Dean of Middleham obferves, that the quantity 
of ground allowed to field Haves for raifmg provifions 
does not admit of their frequently pofiefiino; any confider- 
able property. It is not likely they can fpare much of 
their produce for fale. Sometimes they pofTeis a pig, and 
two or three fowls, and if they have alfo a fev/ plantain 
trees, thefe may be the means of fupplying them with 
knives, iron pot?, and fuch other conveniences as their 
mafters do not allow them. 

The greatefl property Mr. M. Terry ever knew a 
field flave to pofTefs was two pigs, and a little poultry. 
A fidd f.ave has not the ?neans of getting much property, 

Mr. J. Terry has known the field flaves fo poor as not 
'to be able to have poultry. They were not alio ved to keep 
iheep on any eflate he knew. On fome they might keep 
two or three goats, but very few allowed it. Some keep 
pigs and poultry, if able to buy any. 

To thefe teftimonies it may be added, that all the 
evidences^ to whom the quefliion has been propofed, agree 
in anfwering, that they never knew nor heard of a field 
Have ever amafling fuch a fum, as enabled him to purchafe. 

his own freedom. 

With rerpe6t to the artificers, fuch as houfe -carpenters, 
coopers, and mafons, and the drivers and head-flaves, 

wha 



( 6i ) 

'who form the remaining part of the plantation Haves, th^y 
they are defcribed as having in general a more certain '^ro^crt^^ 
allowance of provifions, and as being better ofF. 

Having now defcribed thejftate of the playitation^ \tSituatmiof 
will be proper to fay a iQ\N worlds on that of the In- and- ^^^ ^n-and" 
Out-door Jlaves The -In-door flaveSj^or domedics, ^rQ^^siatlll 
allowed by all the evidences to be better clothed, and lefs 
worked than the others, and invariably to look better. 
Some, however, complain of their being much pinched 
for food,* and the women often fo as to be driven to 
proftitution, but the general account is that they are 
better ted than the field flaves, Their life, however, is 
defcribed to be often wretched by being continually under 
the eye of their in afters and miftrefles, and therefore 
continually fubje6t to be teized and mortified at their 
caprice, fo that Forfter, (as will be explained hereafter) 
thinks their fituation even harder in this refpe6l than that 
of the field Jlavts^ and Coor has known many of them 
wifti to be fent into the field. 

With refpe^l: to the Out-door flaves, feveral perfons, 
who have a few (laves, and little work, allow them to 
work out, and oblige them to bring home three or four 
bits a day. The fituation of thefe is confidered to be 
very hard, for they are often unable to find work, and to 
earn the ftated fum. and yet, if they fail, they are kv^rdy 
puniflied. Mr. Clappefon has known them fteal grafs, 
and fell it, to make up the fum required. 

In this defer iption may be ranked fuch as follow the 
occupation of porters. Thefe are allowed to work out, 
and at the end of the week obliged to bring home to their 
mafters a certain weekly fum. Their fituation is much 
aggravated by having no fixed rates. If, fays f Forfter, 
on being offered too little for their work they remonftrate, 
they are often beaten, and receive nothing, and fhould 

* Some give them one, tv/o, or three bits a week, tomainraln themfelves 
upon, but the mode of feed ing them, as well as their allowance, is lubjeft 
to no rule,

Srhutuon of thev refufe the next call from the fame perfon, they are 
*^m-doT ' fiinimonecl before a magiftrate, and punifhed on the 
S^xevcs, parade for refufal, and he has known them fo punifhed. 

To the fame defcrlption belong thofe unhappy females, 
who have leave to go out for proftitution, and are obliged 
to bring their owners a certain payment per week. 
Handfome women are expected to bring home more 
money than the ordinary. They are pumfljed if they 
return without thcjull wages of their projliiution, 

OrSnarf Having now d fcribed the labour, food, clothing, houfes, 

^ri^'ci"*^ property, and different kinds of employment of the plan- 
iy the mip^'S^^^on, 2i% well as the fituation of the In-and-out-door 
^Cowjhn. flaves, as far as the evidence will warrant, it may be 
proper to advert to th^ir punifhments ; and, firft, to thofe 
that are inflicted by the cowfkui or the whip. 

In the towns many people have their flaves flogged upon 
their own premifles, in which cafe it is performed by a 
man, who is paid for it, and who goes round the town 
in queft of delinquents. But thofe, fays Mr. H, Rofs, 
who do not chufe to difturb their neighbours with the 
flaves cries, fend them to the wharfs or gaol, where 
they are corrected alfo by perfons paid. At other times 
they are whipped publickly round the town, and at others 
tied down, or made to ftand in fome publick place, artd 
receive it there. 

When they are flogged on the wharfs, to which they 
go fcr the convenience of the cranes and weights, they 
are defcribed by H. Rofs, Morley, Jeffrey ?, Towne, arid 
Captain Scott, to have their arms tied to the hooks of the 
crane^ and zveights of fifty-fix pounds applied to their feet. 
In this fituation the crane is wound up, fo that it lifts 
them nearly from the ground, and keeps them in a 
ftretched pofture, when the whip or cow-fkin is ufed. 
After this they are again whipped, but with ebony bujhes 
(which are more prickly than the thorn bufhes in this 
country) in order to let out the co7igealed bloods Captain 
Scott, defcribing it, fays, that he faw a white man 

purfus 



( 63 ) 

purfue a negro into the water, bring him out^ and take Ordln&yy 
him to the wharf, where he had him hung up to a crane /"'^^y-^"^^"^ 
by the hands, which were tied together, and weights tiedf J^J^JJ^ 
to his feet. When thus hoifted up, but fo as flill iQ^Co'usjklL 
touch the ground^ another negro was ordered to whip 
him with a prickly bu(h. He walked away from the 
difagreeable fight. The next day he fav/ the fame ne- 
gro lying on the beach, and, with the alliftance of 
another, taking the prickles out of his breech, feem- 
ingly fvvelled and bloody. The negro ailigned as a 
reafon for the whipping, the wharfinger thought he had 
Jia'id too lon'g on an errand, 

Refpe£l:ing the whippings in gaol and round the town. 
Dr. Harrifon thought them too feveie to be inflicted on 
any of the human fpecies. He attended a man, who 
had beenilogged in gaol, who was ill in confequence five 
or fix weeks. It was byliis mafter's oxdtv for not coming 
when he was called. Fie could lay two or three fingers 
in the wounds made by the whip. 

On the other m.ode General Tottenham obferves, that 
he was at a planter's houfe when the Jumper came. He 
heard him afk the mailer, if he had any commands for 
him. The Mafter replied. No. The Jumper then 
afked the Miftrefs, who replied. Yes. She direded 
him to take out two very decent women^ who attended 
at table, and to give each of them a dozen lafhes. Ge- 
neral Tottenham expoftulated with her, but in vain. 
They were taken out to the publick parade, and he had 
the curiofity to go v/itli thenn. Tiie Jamp:fr carried a 
long whip like our waggoners. He ordered one of the 
women to turn her back, and to take up her clothes 
entirely, and he gave her a dozen on the breech. Every 
ftroke brought flefh from her. She behaved with 
aftonifhing fortitude. After the puniibment, flie, ac- 
cording to cuftom, curtefied and thanked him : the other 
had the fame punifhment, and behaved in the fame v/ay. 

The punifhments in the country by means of the 
^vhip and cow-fl^ir. appear to differ, except in one in- 

Itance, 



( 64 ) 

Ordmaryp-^2incey ffom thofc whlch have been mentioned of the 

njJhmenH of 
the /lava by 
thilVhip 

andCQ-vfum, It is ufual foi* thofe, fays Mr. Coor, who do not come 
into the field in time to be puniftied. In this cafe a few 
fteps before they join the gang they throw down the hoe^ 
clap both hands on their heads, and patiently take ten, 
fifteen, or twenty lafhes. 

The mode of puni/hment, as feen by Captain Smith 
and feveral others (and which is the general mode) was 
as follows : — A negro v/as ftretched on his belly on the 
ground, with a flave to hold each hand and leg, or each 
hand and leg was faftened to a ftake. The puniftiment 
was irfltdted by a negro with a long whip tapering from 
the fize of a man's thumb to a fmall lafh. At every 
ftroke a piece of flefh was drawn out, and that v/ith 
much unconcern to the director of the puniftiment. 

There is another mode defcribed by Mr. Coor^ 
About eight o'clock, fays he, the overfeer goes to break- 
faft, and if he has any criminals at home, he orders a 
black man to follow him ; for it is then uilial to take 
fuch out of the flocks, and flog them before the over- 
feer's houfe. The method is generally this : — The de- 
linquent is flripped and tied on a ladder, his legs on the 
fides and his arms above his head, and fometimes a rope 
is tied round his middle. The driver whips him on the 
bare fkin, and if the overfeer thinks he does not lay it on 
'i* hard enough, he fometimes knocks him dovv^n with his 

own hand, or makes him change places with the delin- 
quent, and be feverely whipped. Mr. Coor has known 
many receive on the ladder, from one hundred to one 
hundred and fifty lafhes, and fome two cool hundreds, as 
they are generally called. He has known many return- 
ed to confinement, and in one, two or three days, 
brought to the ladder, and receive the fame compliment, 
or thereabouts, as before. They leldom take them ofF 
the ladder, ; until all the fkin, from the hams to the 
fmall of the back, appears only raw fiefh and blood, and 
then they wafti the parts with fait pickle. This ap- 
peared 



( 6s ) 

peared to him, from the convulfions It occafionedj more ^^^'''(^"y p»^ 
cruel than the whipping, but it was done to prevent mor- o:',-/^V ' 
tification. He has known many after fuch whipping fent Slaves hytU 
-o the field under a guard and worked all day, with no^^'^'P^^''"^ 
food but what their friends might give them, out of their ° ''' '* 
own poor pittance. He has known them returned to the 
flocks at night, and worked next day, fucceflively. This 
cruel whipping, hard working, and ftarving has, to his 
knowledge, made many commit fuicide. He remem« 
bers fourteen fiaves, who, from bad treatment, rebelled 
on a Sunday, ran into the woods, and all cut their 
throats together. 

In fpeaking of the punifliments of the fiaves by means 
of the whip and cowjQcin, it is impillible to pafs over 
the frequency and feverity of them as defcribed in the 
evidence, as well as the lengths to which fome of their 
owners go, upon thefe occafions. 

On tht frequency of thefe punlfbments fomething may be ^reqitmcy^ 
deduced from the different expreffions which the different ^r^^^P^^J^ 
'evidences adopt according to their different opportuni- yupmems, 
ties of obfervation. Many of the field fiaves are faid by 
Duncan, Dalrymple, Fitzmaurice, and Rees, to be 
marked with the whip. J great proportion of them is the 
term ufed by Captain Wilfon. That they are marked 
commonly or generally^ or that the generality of them are 
marked, are the expreflions agreed in by the Dean of 
Middleham, Lieutenant Simpfon, Captain Rofs, Captain 
Hall (navy) Captain Giles, Captain Smith, and Lieu- 
tenant Davifon. T^he greater part of them, fays Jeffreys, 
mo/i of them^ fay Coor and Woolrich, bear the marks of 
the whip. Thefe marks again, fays Giles, you will find 
on almoft all the vjeaker part of the gang j and Falcon- 
bridge, General Tottenham, and Tovv^ne, agree in fay- 
ing, either that they hardly ever faw any^ or that very 
few were to be feen without fears or other marks of the 
whip. 

With refpe6t to the feverity of thefe punifhments, it 

may be fliewn by defcribing the nature of the inilru- 

I ment 



( 66 ) 

Trequency mcnt With whIch they are inflided, and the power it 
T/tMepZ ^^^> ^"^ ^^^ efFe£t it produces wherever it is ferioufly 
°nt/hLnts\ appHed. 

The whip, fays Woolrlch, is generally made of plaited 
cowfkin, with a thick ftrong laih. It is fo formidable 
an inftrument in the hands of fome of the overfeers, that 
by means of it they can take the fkin off a horfe's back. 
He has heard them boaft of laying the marks of it in a 
deal board, and he has feen it done. On its application 
on a flave*s back he has feen the blood fpurt out imme- 
diately on the firft ftroke.* 

t Nearly the fame account of its conflru61:ion is given 
by other evidences, and its power and efFedts are thus 
defcribed. At every ftroke, fays Captain Smith, a piece 
of fie Jh was drawn out, Dalrymple avers the fame thing. 
It will even bring blood through the breeches^ fays J. Terry ; 
aud fuch is the effufion of blood on thofe occafion?, 
adds Fitzmaurice, as to make their frocks, if immedi- 
ately put on, appear as fiiff as buckram ; and Coor ob- 
ferves, that at his firft going to Jamaica, a ftght of a com- 
mon flogging would put him in a tremble^ fo that he did not 
feel right for the reji of the day. It is obierved alfo by Dr. 
Harrifon and the Dean of Middleham, that the incifions 
are fometimes fo deep that you may lay your fingers in the 
wounds. There are alfo wheals^ fays Mr. Coor, fro?n 
their hams to thejmall of their backs, Thefe wheals, cuts, 
or marks, are defcribed by Captain Thompfon, Dean of 
Middleham., Mr. Jeffreys, and General Tottenham, as 
indelible^ as lafting to old age^ or as fuch as no time can erafcy 
and V/oolnch has often feen their backs one undiftin^ 
guifced majs of lumps ^ holes^ and furrows, 

* The military wKip, fays General Tottenham, cuts the ikin, whereas 
that for the negroes cuts out the flefh. 

- \ Dr. Jackfon and others mention another kind of whip in ufe, which 
they df^fcnbe to be like what our waggoners ufe, ai.d to be throAvn at the 
diftance of three or four paces, which the former obferves greatly increafes 
the weight of the lalhes. To this whip Captain Cook alludes, when he 
fays, a dextrous flogger could ftrike fo exaftly as to lodge the point of the 
lafh juft w.thin the lieib, where it would remain till picked out with his 
finger and thumb. 

As 



( 67 ) 

As farther proofs of the fevertiy of thefe punifhments Frc^tfenty 
by the whip or cowfkin, the following fadb may be ad- ^^"r^yTpu, 
duced. Duncan and Falconbridge have known them nj/hmnu. 
fo whipped that they could not lie down. Fitzmaurice has 
often known pregnant women fo feverely whipped as 
to have mifcarried in confequence of it. Clappefon alfo 
knew a pregnant woman whipped and delivered on, the 
fpot. Davifon was once fent for to a woman Have, 
who. mifcarried from fevere flogging, when both Jhe and 
the child died. He knew alfo a new negro girl die of a 
mortif cation of her wounds two days after the whipping 
had taken place. A cafe fimilar to the laft is alfo men- 
tioned by Mr. Rces. Finding one day in his walks 
a woman lying down and groaning, he underftood from 
her that fhe had been fo feverely whipped for running ^ 

away, that fhe could hardly move from the place where 
fhe was. Her left fide, where fhe had been moft whip- 
ped, appeared in a mortifying Jlate^ and almoji covered 
with worms. He relieved her, as (he was hungry, and 
in a day or two afterwards going to vifit her again, 
found fne was dead and buried. To mention other in- 
ilances : a '^2iX\K.tx flogged his driver to deaths and even 
boafted of it to the perfon from whom Mr. Dalrymple 
had the account. Captain Hall alfo (of the navy) 
knows by an inftance that fell under his eye, that a 
Jlave^s death may be occafioned by fevere punifhment. Dr, 
Jackfon thinks alfo fevere whippings are fometimes the 
occafion of their death. He recollecEts a negro dying un- 
der the lafh^ ov foon afterwards ; and Captain Rofs avers, 
that they often die in a few days after their fevere punifli-' 
ments, for having but little food, and little care being 
taken to keep the fores clean after the whipping, their 
their death is often the confec^uence. 

Having now collecled what is faid on the punifliments tt . a- 
by the whip and cowlkm, it will be proper to va^x^WOiTi na^y pumjlo- 
thofe other modes with which the evidence prefents us. rnmts afmd^r^^ 
Thefe, however, are not eafdy fubjedl to a divifion from ^'"'^^' 
the great variety of their kinds.

Captain Rofs, fpeaking of the country, has knov^n

chain of fixty or feventy pounds weight put on them, 
and a large collar about their necks, and a weight of fifty- 
fix pounds faRened to the chain when they were drove 
a-fieJd. 

Mr Cook flates that, Vi/hen runaways are brought in, 
they are generally feverely flogged, and fometimes have 
an iron'hoot put on one or both legs, and a chain or collar 
round their neck. The chain is locked, the collar faf- 
tened on by a rivet. When the collar is vy^ith three pro- 
je£lionSy it is impojjlble for them to lie down to fleep : even 
with two^ they mLifl lie imeafily- He has (QCn collars with 
four proje^ions. He never knew any injury from the 
chain and collar, but feverely galling their necks. He 
has, however, knov/n a negro lofe his leg from wearing the

parently near the houfe, was this retch left expofed to 
the noon-day fun. Returnin, - a/Vit; hiurs a,ter^ they found 
himftill in the fa??u jtate^ and would have releafed him, but 
for the advice of General Frere, who had an eflate in the 
neighbourhood. The gentlemen, through difgufl, 
Shortened their viHt, and returned the next morning. 

5. Lieutenant Davifon and Mr, Woolrich men- 
tion the ihumb-fcreWy and Mr. Woolrich, Captain Rofs, 
Mr. Clappefon, and Dr, Harrifon, mention the picket^ 
as inftruments of puniiliment. A. negro man, in 
Jamaica, fays Dr. Harrifon, was put on the picket fo long 
as to caufe a mortification of his fout and hand^ on fufplcion 
of robbing his maflrer, a publick officer, of a fum of 
money, which it afterwards appeared, the mafler had taken 
himfelf. Yet the mafter was privy to the punifhment, 
and the Have had no compenfation. He was puniihed 
by order of the mafter^ vjho did. not then chuje to make it 
known that he himfef had made ufe of the money, 

6. Jeffreys, Captain Rofs, M. T'erry, and Coor^ 
mention the cutting off of ears., as another fpecies of pu- 
nifhment. The laft gentleman gives the following in- ' 

fiance in Jamaica. One of the houfe-girls having broken 
a plate ^ or Jpilt a cup of tea, the doctor, (vs^ith whom Mr. 
Coor boarded) nailed her ear to apoji. Mr. Coor re- 
monftrated with hirn in vain. They went to bed, and 
left her there. In the morning fhe was gone, having 
torn the head of the nail through her ear. She was foon 
brought back, and when Mr. Coor came to breakfaft, 
he found flie had been very feversly whipped by the do61or, 
who in his fury, clipped both her ears off clofe to her hcad^

y. Mr. M. Cook, while in Jamaica, knew a run- 
away Qave brought in, with part of a turkey with 
him, which he had ftolen, and which, Mr. Cook thinks, 
he had Jiolen from hunger^ as he was nothing but Jkin and 
hone. His mafter immediately made two negroes hold 
him down, and with a hammer and a punch, knocked out 
two of his upper^ and tivo of his under teeth, 

Mr. Dalrymple was informed by a young woman flave, 
in Grenada, who had no teeth, that her miftrcfs had, 
with her own hands, pulled them ouiy and given her a 
fevere flogging befides, the marks of which flie then 
bore. This relation was confirmed by feveral tovv'n'$ 
people of whom he inquired concerning it. 

8. Mr. JefFereys has ^t^n flaves with one of 
their hands off^ which he underftood to have been cut off 

for If ting it up a^ainfl a white man. Captain Lloyd alfo 
faw at Mrs. Winne's at Mammee Bay in Jamaica, a 
feirale flave, with but one hand only, the other having 
been cut off for the fame offence. Mrs. Winne had 
endeavoured to prevent the amputation, but in vain, for 
her indented white woman could not be diffuaded from 
fwearing that the flave had itruck her, and the hand was 
Gceordingly cut off, 

9, Captain Giles, DocStor Jackfon, Mr. Fitzmau* 
rice, and Mr. M. Terry, have feen negroes whofe 
legs had been cut ofl^ by their mafter' s orders^ for running 
Givax^ and Mr. Dalrymple gives the following account; 
A French planter, fays he, in the Engliih ifland of Gre- 
nada, 4cnt for a furgeon to cut off the leg of a negro who 
had run away. On the furgeon's refufing to do it, the 
planter took an iron bar^ and broke the leg in pieces^ and then 
the furgeon cut It off. This planter did many fuch ads 
of cruelty, and all with impunity,

10. Mr. Fitzmaurlce mentions, among other In^ ^xtr^mii-^^ 
ftances of cruelty, that of dropping iiot lead upon negroes, "^Zls^of^^ 
which he often faw practifed by a planter of the name of kinM, 
Rufhie, during his refidence in Jamaica, 

11. Mr. Hercules Rofs, hearing one day, in Jamai- 
ca, from an inclofure, the cries of fome poor wretch 
under torture, he looked through, and faw a young fe- 
male fujp Tided by the ix. rifis to a tree^ fivinging to and fro. 
Her toes could barely touch the ground, and her body was 
exceedingly agitated. The fight rather confounded him, 
as there was no Vvhipping, and the mafter was jufl by feem- 
ingly motionlefs ; but, on looking more attentively, he faw 
in his hand ajiick 'f f:re^ vvhich he held Jo as occafionally 
to touch her about her private parts as fhe fwung. He 
continued this torture with unmoved countenance, until 
Mr. H. Rofs, calling on him to A^{\^^ and throwing ftones 
2X him over the fence, flopped it. 

12. Mr. Fitzmaurice once found Rufhie, the Ja- 
maica planter before mentioned, in the a5l of hanging 
G. negro. Mr. Fitzmaurice begged leave to intercede, as 
he was doing an action that, in a few minutes, he would 
repent of. Rufliie, upon this, being a paffionate man^ 
ordered him off his eftate. Mr. Fitzmaurice accord- 
ingly went, but returned early the next morning, before 
Rufhie was up, and going into the curing-houfe, beheW 
the fame negro lying dead U'pon a board* It was notorious 
that Rufhie had killed many of his negroes, and deftroyed 
them fo fafl, that he was obliged to fell his eflate. — 
Captain Rofs fays alfo, that there was a certain planter 
in the fame ifland, who had hanged a negro on a poji^ clofe 
to his houfe^ and in three years deftroyed forty negroes, 
out of fixty, by feverity.* The refl of the conduft of 
this planter, as defcribed by Captain Rofs, was, after ?l 
debate, cancelled by the Committee of the Houfe of 
Commons who took the evidence, as containing cir- 
cumftances too horrible to be given to the world : and

13. On Shrewfbury eftate, in Jamaica, fays Mr. 
Coor, the overfeer fent for a flave, and in talking 
with him, he haftily [truck him on the head^ with a f ma II 
hanger^ and gave him two Jiabs about the wa'ift. The 
flave faid, '^ Overfeer, you have killed me." He pufhed 
him out of the piazza. The flave went home, and 
died that night. He was buried, and no more faid about 
it. — A manager of an eftate fays, Mr.Woolrich, in Tor- 
tola, whofe owner did not refide on the ifland, fitting at 
dinner, in a fudden refentment at his cook, went direcSlly 
to his fword, and ran the negro woman through the body^ 
and Jhe died upon the floor immediately^ and the negroes 
were called in to take her away and bury her. 

14. Mr. Giles recollects feveral fhocking in- 
ftances of punifhment. In particular, on the eftate 

' where he lived, in Montferrat, the driver at day- break 

once informed the overfeer, that one of four or five 
negroes, chained in the dungeon, v/ould not rife. He 
accompanied the overfeer to the dungeon, who fet the 
others that were in the chain to drag him out, and not 
riilng v/hen out, he ordered a bundle of cane-traJJj to be 
put round hi?n^ and fet fire to. As he ftill did not rife, 
he had a fmall folder ing iron heated^ and thruft between his 
teeth. As the man did not yet rife, he had the chain 
taken off, and fent him to the hofpital, where he languijhed 
fome days and died, 

15. An overfeer, on the eftate where Mr. J. 
Terry v/as in Grenada, (Mr. Coghlan) threw a flave 
into the boiling cane-juice^ who died in four days, Mr. J» 
Terry was told of this by the owner's fon, by the car- 
penter, and by many Haves on the eftate. He has heard 
it often.

planter in Tortola, with whom he was v/ell acquainted. 
The overfeer having orders to take him dead or alive^ a

jumpmg up, laid, " What, you kill me alleep; 2ina kinds, 
dropped dead immediately. The overfeer took off his 
head^ and carried it to the owner. Mr. Woolrich knew 
another inftance in the fame ifland. A planter, offended 
with his waiting man, a mulatto, ftepped fuddenly to his 
guriy on which the man ran off, but his mailer y7;c^ him 
through the head with a jingle hulL

It is much to be lamented, that there are others in the punipmintu 
evidence not yet mentioned. But as it is neceffary to in- 
fert a new head, under which will be explained the concern 
v/hich the very * vjomen take^ both in the ordinary and 
extraordinary punifhments of the fiaves, and as fome of 
the latter not yet mentioned are infeparably conneiled 
with it, it was thought proper to cite them under this 
new divifion rather than continue them under the old. 

It will appear extraordinary to the reader, that many 
women, living in the colonies, ihould not only order^ and 
oh^n f up er 1771 end^ but fometimes actually irijii^ with their 
czun hands fome fevere punifliments upon their flaves, and 
that thefe fhould not always be women of a low order, 
hxxt frequently of refpe£i ability and rank* 

In the inftance of whipping, mentioned by General 
Tottenham, (p. 63) we find the order for it given by 
the wife of a planter, whom the General was vifiting, 
though the hufband had declined it on his part. A lady 
is reprefented by Mr. Cook as having her domeftics 
flogged every Monday morning. Capt. Cooke reprefents 
a woman of refpe5iable condition as fending her fervant to

The fart t)e floggcd/^r <z ?nijlake only. Lieutenant Davifon has 

w^/c^ the Qffei^ known the miftrefs fend her domeftics to be pu- 

taZ iniZfe nifticd, and without telling them for what. He has feen 

^Knijhmcnts. a {lave alfo, both whofe nojirils had hcenjlit by her miftrefs'' s 

order^ who was of Jome confequence., being the wife of the 

Chief Engineer of the illand, and he alfo remembers a 

new negro girl, flogged by the order of her miftrefs, who 

died in two days afterwards of her wounds. 

Lieutenant Davifon, Captain Smith, and Dr. Jackfon, 
all agree, that it was common for ladies of refpeSiability and 
rank to fuperintend the punijhments of their flaves. Con- 
formably with this, we find Dr. Harrifon ftating to the 
Committee, that a negro, in Jamaica, was flogged to 
death by her miftrefs's order, who ftood bv to fee the 
puniihment. Lieutenant Davifon alfo ftates, that in the 
fame ifland, he has feen feveral negro girls at work with 
the needle, in the prefence of their miftrefl^es, with a 
thumb-fcrew on their left thumbs, and he has feen the 
blood gufh out from the ends of them. He has alfo feen 
a negro girl made to kneel with her bare knees on peb- 
bles, and to^work there at the fame time ; a fort of punifb- 
iTient, he fays, among the domeftics, which he knows to 
be in common ufe. 

On the fubje6l of women becoming the executioners 
of their own fury, Do6lor Jackfon obferves, that the firft 
thing that fnocked him in Jam^aica Vv^as a creole lady, of 
feme conjequence^ fuperintsnciing the piinifoment ofherflaves^, 
male and female^ ordering the number of laJJjes^ and^ vjith 
her own hands^ flogging the negro driver^ if he did not 
^un'tjh properly. 

Capt. Cook relates, that two young ladies of fortune, 
in Barbadoes, lifters, one of whom was difpleafed at the 
pregnancy of a female flave belonging to the other, by 
the fon of the furgeon attending the eftate, proceeded to 
fome very derogatory a6ts of cruelty. With their own 
garters they tied the young woman neck and heels, and 
then heat her almoft to death vi^ith the heels of their Ihoes. 
One of her eyes continued a long w^hile afterwards in

herein, confining and degrading her. Captain ^^oV''^^J.^^J^^^^ 
came in during the beating, and was an eye witnefs to it tak m tUfe 

himfelf. punl/hmcnts. 

Captain Cook ftates farther, that he faw a woman, 
named Rachel Lauder, beat a female flave moft unmer- 
cifully. Having hruijed her head almoji to a jelly ^ with 
the heel of her fhoe, flie threw her with great force on 
the feat of the child's necefTary, and then tried to /lamp 
her head through the hole^ and would have murdered her, 
if not prevented by two officers. The girl's crime was 
the not bringing money enough from on board fhip, 
where {he was fent by her miftrefs, for the purpoje of 
projiitutton. 

Lieutenant Davifon ftates, in his evidence, that the 
clergyman's wife at Port Royal, was remarkably cruel. 
She ufed to drop hot fealtng wax on her negroes, after 
flogging them. He was fent for as furgeon to one of 
them, v/hofe brcaft was terribly burnt with feaiing wax. 
He was alfo once called in to a woman flave, who had 
been tied up all night by her hands, and had been abufed 
with cayenne pepper^ by the fame mijirefs-^ and in a way 
too horrid and indecent to mention. He lived next door, 
he ftates alfo, to a wafher- woman at Port Royal, who 
was almoft continually flogging her negroes. He has 
often gone in and remonftrated againft her cruelty, when 
he has feen the negro women chained, to the wajhing-tubs^ 
almoji naked^ with their thighs and backs in a gore of bloody 
from flogging. He could mention various other capricious., 
punilhments, if neceflary. 

Mr. Forfter, examined on the fame fubje61:, fays he 
has known a creole woman, in Antigua, drop hot feaiing 
vjax on a girl's back, after a flogging. He and many 
others fav/ a young woman of fortune and character 
flogging a negro man very feverely with her own hands.

The Haves appear to have been puni/hed, as far as can 
be afcertained from the evidence under the head of ordi- 
nary puniihments, for not coming into the field in t'lme^ 
not pickmg a pficicnt quantity of grafs^ not appearing 
Willing to work, when in iadifick and not ahU^ tor flaying

and for iheft^ to which they were ofun d riven by hunger.

appear to have furE^red for rumiing atvay^ or for lifting 
up a hand againil a white many or for hrtaking a pkde^ 
or fpihing a cup of tea^ or to extort confefj-.on. Others; '

Under the head of '' the part which the very women 
take in thefe punilhments/' a female flave is punifnedfor 
being found pregnant \ another for not bringing home the

of her miftrefs ; others again from an opinion that flaves 
could not be managed without feverity; and others in the

In fliortj it appears that they are often punifhed as caprice 
and painon didates, and to fuch lengths do people go

but who mimicked him, for the purpofe of gratifying his 
revenge. After having bought him, he ordered him to

On the fubje£l of capital oiTences and punlfhments, a Capital ©ya 
|:nan and a woman Have are mentioned to have ^^^^^p''^^/i^^,^ 
hanged, the man for * running away, and the v/oman 
for having fecreted him. The Dean of Middlehain faw 
two inftances of fiaves being gibbetted alive in chains, . 
but he does not fay for vv'hat, only that this is the punifh- 
ment for enormous crimes : and Mr. Jefferys, the only 
other perfon Vv'ho fpeaks on this fubje6i:, fays, that he 
was in one of the iflands, when fome of the fiaves mur- 
dered a white man, and deilroyed fome property on the 
eftate. The execution of thefe he defcribes as follows : 

He was prefent, he fays, at the execution of (QWQn 
riegroes in Tobago, in the year 1774, v/hofe right arms 
were chopped off: they were then dragged to (qygd. 
ftakes, and a fire, confifting of train and dry wood, was 
lighted about them. They were there burnt to death. 
He does not remember hearing one of them murmur, 
complain, cry, or do any thing that indicated fear. One 
of them in particular, narned Chubb, was taken in the 
woods that morning, was tried about noon, and was 
thus executed v/ith the reft in the evening. Mr. Jeffreys 
flood clofe by Chubb, v/hen his arm was cut off. He 
ftretched his arm out, and laid it upon the block, pulled 
up the fleeve of his iliirt, with more coolnefs than he, 
(Ajt. Jefferys) fhould ha/e done, if he had been to be 
let blood. He afterwards v/ould not fuffer himfelf to be 
dragged to the ilake, as the others had been, but got 
upon bis fQtty and walked to it. As he was going 
to the ftake, he turned about, and addreffed himfelf to 
Mr. Jeffreys, who .was ftanding within t-.^'-) or three 
yards of him, and iaic.. " Buckra, you iee me now, but 
*' to-morrow I fhall be like that," kicking up tne duft 
v/ith his foot. (Here Mr, Jeffreys fojemmly added in 
his evidence the words " So help me God."") The 
impreiiion this made upon his mind, Mr. Jeffreys de- 
clared, no time ever could erafe. Sarapfon, who made 
the eighth, and a negro, whofe name Mr. J'effreys does

Punj/hnuuts. ^^^^^^ ^jj^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^^ which, to the beft of his recol- 
lection, was feven days. The other negro was fen- 
tenced to be fent to the mines in South America, and, 
he believes, v/as fent accordingly. Neither of thofe 
two, during the time of ihe execution, (hewed any marks 
or concern, or difniay that he could obferve. A ftronger 
inftance of human fortitude, he declared, he never faw. 

Slaves turmd Having now ftated the fubftance of the evidence 
tat^bkor^^ the fubjetSl of offences and punifhments, we come 
Labour. to a cuftom which appears too general to be palled over 
in fiience. 

Dalrymple, Foriler, Captain Smith, Captain Wilfon, 
and General Tottenham, alTert that it is no uncommon 
thing for perfons to negleSi and turn off their flaves when 
pafi: labour. They are turned off^ lay Captain Wilfon, 
Lieutenant Davifon, and General Tottenham, to plunder^ 
heg^ or ftarve. Captain Cook has known feme take 
care of them ; but fays, others leave them toj^arve and 
die. They are often defired when old, favs Mr. Fitz- 
maurice, to provide for themfelves^ and they fuffer much, 
Mr. Clappefon knew a man who had an old, decrepid 
woman flave, to whom he would allow nothing. When 
palt labour, the owner did not feed them^ fays Giles; and 
Cook ftates that, within his experience, they had no food 
lut what they could get from fuch relations as they might 
have had. This is the account given by the different 
witnelTes ; and accordingly we find fome of the fuper- 
annuated flaves on the different eftates, who wanted every 
thing (Harrifon); others begging (Rees); others digging in 
ihe dunghill for food^ (Dalrymple); and others lying, mi- 
ferable objects, about the zvharfs and beaches^ and in the 
roads and ftreets (Jeffreys, J. Woodward and Cook). 
Y General Tottenham has often met them, and, once in 
particular, an old woman, pafl labour, who told him that 
her mafter hady^i her adrift to Jhift for herfelf He faw 
her about three days afterwards, lying dead in the fame 
place. This cuftom of turning them off when old and 

helplefa 



( 79 ) 

helplefs Is called in the illands (Captain Wilfon and ^j 
Captain Lloyd) '^ Giving them free." 



Asa proof how little the life of an oldfave is regarded 
in the Weft Indies, we may make the following extract 
from the evidence of Mr. Coor. Once when he was 
dining with an overfeer, an old woman who had run 
away a few days, was brought home, with her hands tied 
behind. After dinner, the overfeer, with the clerk, 
named Bakewell, took the woman, thus tied, to the 
hot-houfe, a place for the iick, and where the ftocks are 
in one of the rooms. Mr. Coor went to work in the 
mill, about one hundred yards oiF, and hearing a moft 
diftrefsful cry from that houfe, he afked his men, who 
and what it was. They faid they thought it was old 
Quafheba. About five o'clock the noife ceafed, and 
about the time he was leaving work, Bakewell came to 
him, apparently in great fpirits, and fald, " Well, Mr. 
Coor, Old Quaftieba is dead. We took her to the 
ilocks-room ; the overfeer threw a rope over the beam ; 
I was Jack Ketch, and hauled her up, till her feet were 
ofFthe ground. The overfeer locked the door, and took 
the key with him, till my return juft now, with a flave 
for the ftocks, when I found her dead," Mr. Coor faid, 
*' You have killed her, I heard her cry all the after- 
noon." He anfwered, " D — n her for an old h—^h^ 
Jhe was good for nothing ; what fignifies killing fuch an 
old woman as her J'"' Mr. Coor fald, " Bakev/ell, you 
fhock me," and left him. The next morning his men 
told him, they had helped to bury her. 

But It appears that the aged are not the only perfons 
whofe fate is to be commiferated, when they become of 
no value ; for people in youth, if difabled, are abandoned 
to equal mifery. General Tottenham, about three 
weeks before the hurricane, faw a youth, about nine- 
teen, walking in the ftreets, in a moft deplorable fitua- 
tion, entirely nahed.^ and with an iron collar about his neck^ 
with five long p'ojeSiingfpikes, His body^ before and be- 
hind^ his breech^ belly^ and thighs^ were almojl cut to pieces^ 
»nd with running fores all ov(r them^ and you might put 

your

If it be poilible to view human depravity in a worfe 
light than it has already appeared in on the fubje6l of the 
treatment of the flaves when difabled from labour, it 
may be done by referring to the evidence of Capt. Lloyd, 
who was told by a perfon of veracity, when in the Weft

That, with refped to the ordinary punifhmentSj by the 

whip and cowfkin ("where they do not terminate in 

death) the power of the mailer or overfeer is under little 

or no Gontroul. 

'^ Firil:, Becaufe, as we have already feen, they can 

order or infli(3: punifhment for any, even imaginary, of- 
fences. 

Secondly, Becaufe the lav/ of thirty-nine lafbes (the 
greateft number allowed to be given to a Have, at any one 
time) is a mere farce, and never attended to by mafters

any one of his Haves if executed for a breach oi the laws.

ht owners^ if they fliould think It proper to mflI(Sl: more ; ^^ve W? v? 
for,Woolrich fays, that the chief whipper lays on their back no redrejs 
for ty^ fifty ^fixty^ or more laihes, at the pleajure of the oivner ^i^^^fi'^-^ 
or overfeer. Captain Rofs has known negroes receive two rff^ oj ^ ;^ 
hundred lafhes, where the law would give only thirty- 
nine. Mr. Cook has known a field flave receive two 
hundred hihes^ by order of the overfeer^ and a domeftick 
fifty ^ by order of his miftrefs, Mr. M. Terry alfo ob- 
ferves, that the law was reftriited to thirty '-nine .^ but it 
was not in the leafl attended to during his experience. 
He has, in {hort,y?^?2 it broken repeatedly » The fame lan« 
guage is alfofpoken by others. 

Thirdly, Becaufe, if there fhould be fome, who bear 
the law in their minds, at the time of puniftiihg, the^ 
evade it by various means. Whipping, fays Mr. Fitz« 
maurice, was underftood to be limited to thirty^nine 
lafhes ; but it was often evaded, by putting the negro into 
the ftocks^ and giving him thirty -nine for the fame offence^^ 
next day. We find alfoj by Captain Rofs's account, a 
kiagijtrate^ 2.nd of courie, a guardian of the Idwsy Qvzding 
it in like manner, for that gentleman has feen Johri 
Shackle, Efq. a magiftrate in Jamaica, fogging a negro 
three times in one day^ namely at breakfajt^ dinner^ and at 
fix in the evening : but the negro was in the ftocks betvjeen 
the floggings. Captain Cook alfo exprefsly fays, that 
the law may be evaded by fplitting a crime into many^ 
and, by intervals, dividing the times of punifhment^ and of 
this, where flaves are punifhed at home, he fays there are 
daily inftances. Returning home one evening late with 
Major Fitch of the 90th regt. they heard mofl dreadful 
cries, and, on approaching the fquare at Bridge-town^ 
found they proceeded from the houfe of a man that fold 
liquor, arid heard the repeated lafhes of a whip, on a crea- 
ture whom they conceived to be dying. On their re- 
quefting.admiffion, the cruelty feemed to be wantonly in- 
creafed, v/hich fo provoked them that they broke opea 
the door, and found a negro girl of about nineteen chain* 
ed to the floor, almoft expiring with agony and lofs of 
blood. The man taking refuge behind his counter from 
iheir indignation, and thinking himfelf free from the 

L law, 



( 82 ) 

fhvcVtiih law, immediately cried out with exultation, that he had 
$y no redrcfs Qj-jjy given her t irty-nine laj})es at one ilme^ and that only 
a-Tai^-ji. 1 1 J times fince the beo-innirip; of the night. He then 

n\an^t of any r i i^ i • i i • r • 

fit. threatened than for breaking his door, and interfering he-^ 

iween him and his Jlave^ whom he would fog to death for 
all any one^ and he would give her the fourth thirty-nine 
lafhes before morning, which muil have killed her, as 
file feenied then to be dying. In fhort, to ufe the lan- 
guage of die different evidences, it appears that the flaves 
have no legal redrefs, in the cafe alluded to, againfl: their 
maflers and miilreffes, the latter of whom, even when 
they become the executioners on iuch occafions, are not 
received for it the ivorfe in fociety. Perhaps, fays Dr. 
Jackfon, '-^ fuch a one might he called a termagant^ but Jhe 
was not the lefs refpe^ed. It was indeed thought neccffary 
for an indufirious vjife to be rigid in the punifhment of her 
flaves. It is impoflible to omit mentioning here that 
Lieutenant Davifon was fo hurt at the fevere and fre- 
quent y/hippings of one of thefe women, that he com- 
plained to a magiftrate, who faid he had nothing to do 
•with it. 

With rerpe61: to the overfeer, whom we have {q^vl 
alfo exercifmg a difcretionary power, he is certainly fub- 
ject to the controul of the mafler, if he refides, and in 
cafe of his non-refidence, to that of the attorney of the 
eftate: but then, fays J. Terry, the flaves, if feverely punifh- 
ed for trilling faults, dare not com^plain of him to the mafter 
for fear of worfe treatment. J. Terry has known them 
'-' punijhed by their mafler for fo doing, and fent back to 

the plantation, though their complaints were jufl. Mn 
Cook alfo has known flaves punijhed for complaining to 
the mafter^ and, in his abfence, to the attorney againji the 
overfeer^ for ill ufage. If again, fays Coor, the flaves 
comiplain to the attorney, and the attorney liftens, the 
overfeer fays he will leave the eftate. He has alfo i^&n 
the attorney v/ink at the oppreffion of the flaves, becaufe 
he has a per centage on the crop, and the more the over- 
feer puflies them, the more the attorney gains. The 
fa?ne per centage on the crop is acknowledged alfo by 
Lieut. Davifcn. Captain Rofs neverthelefs Hates that 

overfeers 



( 83 ) 

overfeers are often turned av/ay for fevere v/hipplngs, jj^^^ i;^^ig 
but he is the only one of the evidences who fays fo, znA or m rah-cfs 
it appears that there muft be frequently great obftacles ^^^t^^ 
to thisi for it is obferved by Davifon, Fitzmaurice, andy^^'l/^-' '^ 
Cook, that fome attornies live thirty^ forty ^ ov fifty miles 
from the eftate^ and of courfe that the Haves ^' cannot go 
to complain^ and that the fame three gentlemen, together 
with Coor, J. Terry, and Duncan, ftate that on fome 
eflates one perfon holds the office of attorney and 
overfeer at the fame time^ where his power is of courfe 
under no controul. 

As to fuch of the extraordinary punifbments before 
mentioned as did not terminate in death, fuch as picket- 
ing, dropping hot fealing-wax on the flefh, cutting ofF 
ears and the like, it appears that flaves had no redrefs 
whatever, for that thefe a6tion3 alfo on the part of the 
• mafters were not deemed within the reach of the law. 
In the inftance cited of the Doctor clipping off the ^ars 
of a female flave, no more notice was taken ofit^ fays Coor, 
than if a dog's ears had been cut off^ though it muft have 
been known to the magifrates. In the dreadful inftance 
alfo cited of a planter's breaking his fiave*s leg 'bj an 
iron bar, to induce the furgeon to cut it oiF, as a punifli- 
ment, Mr. Dalrymple obferves that it was not the pub- 
lick opinion, that any puniJJoment was due ta him^ on that 
account^ for though it was generally known^ he was equally 
well received in fociety afterwards as before 5 and in the 
cafe alfo mentioned of the owner torturing his female 
flave by the application of a lighted torch to her body, 
Mr. H. Rofs ftates, only that this owner was not a 
man of chara6ter : with refpe6t to his fuffering by the 
law, he obferves that he was 7iever brought to any trial 
for it ; and he did not know that the law then extended to. 
the punijhment of whites for fuch aSis as thefe^ 

With refpect to fuch of the punifhments as have ter- 
minated in death, the reader will be able to coUeit,

There are no lefs then y^-y^;? fpecifick infiances men- 
tioned in the evidence, in which flaves died in confequence 
of the whipping they received, and yet in no one of them 
was ike murderer brought to an account. One of the per- 
petrators is mentioned by Mr. Dalrymple as having 
^^^y?^i of what he had donej and Dr. Jaclclon fpeaics of 
the other in thefe words, " No attempts^ fays he^ were 
made to bring him to jiijiice : people faid it was an unfortu-' 
Tiate things and were furprized he was not more cautious^ 
as it was not the fir ft thing of the kind that had happened 
to him^ hut they dwelt chiefly on the proprietor'' s lofs" 

In fuch of the extraordinary punifliments, as termi- 
nated in death, there are no lefs than feven fepecifick in~ 
fiances alfo in the evidence. In one of them viz. that of 
throwing the flave into the boiling cane-juice, we find 
from Mr. J. Terry, the overfeer punifhed, but his pu- 
nifhment confifted only of replacing the Jlave and leaving 
his owner* s fervice* In that of killing the flave by light- 
ing a fire round him and putting a hot foldering iron into 
his mouth, the overfeer's condu6t, fays Mr. Giles, was 
not even condemned by his mafter, nor in any of the reft 
were any means whatfoever ufed to punifh the offenders. 
In the three mentioned by Mr. Woolrich he particularly 
fays, all the white people in the ijland were acquainted with 
iheje fa£ls. Neither of the offenders^ hozvever^ were called 
to an account^ nor were they Jhunned in fociety for it^ or con-n 
fidered as in difgrace^ 

In going over the evidence we find three or four othep 
jnftances, not yet cited in this chapter. The firft is that 
of an huckfter in Antigua, v/ho murdered his woman 
jQave v/ith circumftances of the mofl atrocious barbarity^ 

This man however was tried, convi6ted, and fined^ 

Jle is reprefented by Mr. Forfter, as having been uni-^ 
yerfally blamed, but he zvas dealt with as ufual in the 
purfe of trade ^ 

At 



( 85 ) 

At Grenada In the town of St. George, a mafon,^''"-'? -^■^^^-r 
named Chambers, kiJled a negro in the middle of the ^^J'^ZZUfltf^ 
and Mr. Dalrymple beheves in the church yard, but 710 i)hre oj anj 
notice was taken of it* Jon. 

Two Haves, fays Captain Cook, were murdered and 
thrown into the road during his refidence in Barbadces: 
yet no legal inq'iiry ever took place that he heard of. 

He was repeatedly informed by the inhabitants that 
they d;d not chufe to make examples o^ white men thei-e, 
fearing it might be attended with dangerous confe- 
quences. 

Going over the evidence we come at laft to an In- 
ilance (and the only tnftance of the kind mentioned) of a 
white man being hanged for the murder of another's flave; 
and it is very remarkable, that he fhould be reprefented 
as having been hanged more becaufe he was an obnoxious 
man^ than that the murder of a flave was confidered as a 
crime : for Mr Dalrymple ftates that the Chief Jufiice 
ofthelfland (Grenada) told him, he believed if this 
murderer, v/hofe name was Bacchus Prefton, had been a 
man of good chara61:er, or had had friends or money to 
have -paid for the flave^ he v/oiild not have been brought to 
trial. He was of a very bad chara5ler and had been 
obliged to leave Barbadoes upon that account. At Gre- 
nada he had been a Bailiff's follovjer^ and, from his rigour 
in executing his office and had chara^er^ he w2iS pay-it cu^ 
farly obnoxious to the inhabitants ofthetozvn of St. George, 

Such appears to have been, in the experience of the dif- 
ferent evidences cited, the forlorn and wretched fituation 
oftheflaves. They often complain, fays Dr. Jackfon, 
that they are an opprefled people ; that they fuffer in this 
worlds but expect happinejs in the next ; whilft they de- 
nounce the vengeance of God on the white men their op^ 
preffors : if you fpeak to them of future punifhments they 
fay, " Why Jhould a poor negro be punijhed\ he does no 
wrong ; fiery cauldrons^ and fuch things, are ref rved 
for white people^ as punijlwients for the oppreffion offavcs.'*^ 



( 86 ) 

Have Vitth jf j(. fliould be aiked here, whether fome new laws have 
ZJ^Jftiii not lately pafled the legiflature of Tome of the iflands 
?/'/aafo/"«;7y with a view of amending the fituation of the (laves, it 
/or;» niuft be anfwered in the affirmative. The flrft is the 

celebrated confolidated act of Jamaica, and the other is 
an aci of the afTembly of Grenada, entitled " an a6l for 
the better prote6Hon and promoting the increafe and po- 
pulation of Haves." Thefe a(3:s, however, the evidence 
obliges us to obferve, never originated in any intention ta 
ferve the/laves^ and are in reality of little or no ufe. 

Captain Giles, who was in Jamaica both before and 
fmce the palling of the confolidated a6t, gives his evi- 
dence without any diftindion of this epoch, and as if no 
difference had happened in the treatment of the Haves. 

Mr. Cook, long relldent alfo in the fame illand, and 
fmce the pafiing of the a61, knows of no legal protection 
that paves have againil injuries Jrom their maflers, 

Mr, Clappefon, examined exprefsly on the fubje6t, 
fays that he was in Jamaica when the afTembly pailed 
the confolidated lav/. He has often heard it was pafled 
becaufe oi the Jlir in England about the Jlave-rtrade. He 
never heard that any regard was paid to it, flaves being 
Jiill treated as before : nor did he ever hear of any profe- 
cution for fuch difr eg ard, He recolle6ts an inftance of 
difregard to it, which came under his eye. The owner 
of an old and decrepid female flave would allow her nei- 
ther victuals nor clothing; upon which he advifed a fon 
of the woman to complain to a magiftrate, who would 
perhaps order her to be taken care of, if he regarded 
the law ; but he believes he was deterredfrom fear of pu- 
nijhment^ as that owner treated his flaves very harfhly in 
general. 

With rerpe£l: to the other a£l, namely that pafled In 
Grenada, Mr. J. Terry fays, that the opinion there upon 
paffing it v/as, that it ne-ver would have the intended effeSi, 
He did not obferve it m.ake any difference^ except in the 
half days in the week. The clergyman of the parifli 

where 



{ 87 ) 

where he refided, never performed the duty the aB: tmpofed'^ave Ihtte ^ 
on themj and he nev^er heard of any complaints againll^'^^^°,^"^7-/^ 
them for the /ziJ/^-^^/^'ir;;^^?^^^ of it. u{ag€ofaii^ 

forts 

Mr. Dalrymple fiates he was in Grenada, in lySS^ 
when the act w^as palled. The principal objection, and 
which he repeatedly heard, to its paiiing v/as^that it 
might make the flaves believe, that the authority of their 
?najfers was hffened : but otherwife, many thought it 
Vvould be of little ufe^ as it was a law made by themfelves 
again/} themfelves^ and to be executed by themfehes : they 
obferved belides, that fuch lav/s were unneceflary for the 
proteciiion of negroes who were treated well ; and that 
others had y^ jnany opportunities of evading the law (the 
evidence of negroes ?iot being admitted) that it would be of 
no ufe. At the time of paiiing the faid act, the propofal 
in the Britiih Parliament for the abolition of the flave- 
trade was a matter of general difcuffion in the iiland : 
and he believes was a principal reafon for pajfng it, Mr* 
Dalrymple believes it will prove ineffectual : becaufe, as 
no negro evidence is admitted^ thofe who abufe them will 
fiill do it zvith. i?npunity : and people, who live on terms 
of intimacy, would tiiflike the idea of becoming Jpies and 
irfor?ners agairfi each other t, 

All the fa(5ts having been now cited, and the.obfer- 
vations made^ which it was intended to introduce into 
this chapter, it may be concluded in the words of the 
Rev* Mr. Stuart, and General Tottenham, 

The former fays, he his warranted in declaring the ne- 
groes an oppreffed and much injured race, and m no , 
better eftimation than labouring cattle, and every de- 
fcription of their treatment he has mtt With, falls Jhort of 
their real fate. He read Mr. Ramfay's Eflay in manu« 
fcript at. St. Kitt's, and comparing it on the jpot with the 
treatment of the flaves, he thought it too favourable. 

The latter ftated to the Committee, that he thought 
the fiaves in Barbadoes were treated with the greate/i bar- 
barity^ and that he was very pofitive that the impreffion 

concerning 



( 88 ) 

iJavcr:uh concerning their trratment was made on his mincJ at the 

'Irr'J/nfii^^ //w^ and on the fpot^ for he repeatedly told the people of 

^faycojany Bridgetown, that he hoped to live to fee the unfortunate 

/cj'i. fituation of thefe poor wretches taken up hy fo me Mem- 

her of Parl'iajnent^ and that fhould fuch an event take

with thofe of the whiles., and, as a proof, he ftates ^^y^^^^ Europeans in 
of the manufactures, which they carry on from the River capad^j^ 
Senegal to the River Sallum, 

The natives, fays he, are particularly fkilful in manu- f ^^"^^f /^^^ 
fa6turing ^^/.r/ and iron. The art of working the former, y^'^^^ them^It 
he beheves, they derived from the Moors, but they are^/:'«> own 
now almoft the fole artifts themfelves, having never feen^^""^^« 
but one Moor working in that branch. They are equal 
to any European goldfmith in filagree or trinket work, 
and even in other articles, fuch as buckles, except in the 
chafles, tongues, and anchors, which they do not manu- 
facture fo well. The iron which they forge is on anvils 
of a remarkable hard and heavy wood, when they cannot 
get ftone for the purpole. 

M They 



( 9° ) 

Proved hy They manufacture alfo cloth and leather with uncom- 
fiiehashavc ncatncfs. The former they ^/^ alfo blue, yellow, 

Jeen them m i i • i i n c 11 

ihetrown brown, and orange. 1 he cloth is made belt at ballum. 
cBimtry, The latter they tan and work into fandals, and into a 
variety of ufeful and ornamental articles. 

X Befides the above, they are fkilful in making indtgo and 

foap. Th^y mzkQ 2\(o pottery ware^ and prepare /^/f for 
their own ufe from the fea water. 

They make alfo canoes, but as wood of a fufficient 
clofe texture is feldom found on the fea fhore, they make 
them principally in the interior parts. Here they fhape, 
but do not hollow them. When fhaped, they are dragged 
by a number of the natives for weeks together (each 
village generally undertaking to drag them to the next, 
and receiving in return partly European merchandize, and 
partly fifh and fait) till they come to the fea fhore. The 
ropes, with which they drag them, are made of a kind 
of aloe, growing abundantly in the country, and when 
well made by the natives, they are exceeding ftrong and 
good. 

Mr. Wadjdrom offered to produce, if necefTary, fpe« 
cimens of feveral of the above manufactures, which he 
had brought with him from the coafi:. 

Nearly the fame accounts are given of their manufac- 
tures by Dalrymple, Kiernan, and Captain Wilfon : and 
Hall, Newton, Surgeon Wilfon, Sir George Young, 
Falconbridge, Captain Thompfon, and Towne, (without 
enumerating many of their manufactures like the former) 
declare their capacities, either to be good^ or equal to thofe 
of the EtiTopeans, 

Alfo in With refpeCt to their feeling and afFeCtion one inftance 

^e'Mim ^^y ^^ taken from Mr. Falconbridge. Being lent to 
choofe fome flaves out of a yard at Cape Coaft Caftle, 
he obje6led to one that was meagre, and put him afide, 
Mr. Falconbridge obferving a tear ileal down the man's 
cheek, which the man aifo endeavoured to conceal, 

inquired 



C 91 ) 

inquired of him the reafon,— upon which he fald he was ^Ifo m 
goino; to be parted from his brother. ^''J.'"^ '"'"'^ 

As a fecond inftance, Surgeon Wilfon fays, that at 
Bonny, one of the people called Breechies, of the higher 
clafs, was brought on board. He feemed to take his 
iituation to heart, and became ill ; but from indulgencies, 
which none of the reft had, he partly recovered. When 
he was convalefcent, a young woman was alfo brought 
on board, who proved to be his fifter. On their firft 
meeting, they ftood in filence, and looked at each other 
apparently with the greateft afFe6tion ; — they rufhed into 
€ach others arms — embraced — feparated themfelves again, 
—and again embraced. Surgeon Wilfon perceived the 
tears to run down the female's cheeks. The man had a 
return of his former complaint, and bis fifter attended 
him with the greateft care. The firft thing fhe did of a 
morning, was to come to Surgeon Wilfon, and afk how 
her brother did. He at length died — on the news of this, 
his fifter wept bitterly, tore her, hair, and fhewed other 
figns of diftra6lion. They carried her fafe to South 
America, and there delivered her as a fiave. 

As a third inftance, that mentioned by J. Parker may 
be introduced, (page 44) of the poor woman turning her 
head on one fide, when obliged by the whip to drop her 
dead child overboard, and weeping afterwards for many 
hours. 

Mr. Wadftrom is clearly convinced, that the natives 
of Africa zSiUdWy furpafs in affection fach of the Euro- 
peans as he has known. 

On the moral chara(3:er of the natives, Mr. Wadftrom ^'fo >n 
fays, that they are very honeji and hofpitahle. He has ^^^^^^^ 
often pafled days and nights alone with them without the 
leaft fear^ and was treated with all civility and kindnefs. 

Captain Wilfon calls them grateful and affeS^ionate,--^ 

They treated him moft kindly, he fays, when many miles

or grains of Paradife^ red pepper of various forts, but 
particularly the Cayenne^ a fpecies of ginger^ cardamumsy 
wild nutmegs^ and cinnamon. Mr. How fays of the cin-

In the fourth clafs it may be mentioned that there are 
gums of various kinds, but particularly the gum copaL

traveller, among nearly three thoufand plants, which he

Royal Academy at Stockholm, found a great part^ if not

are alfo orange and brown dyes produced from vegetable' 
produ6tions, which grow in fuch abundance, fays Mr. 
Wadftrom, in the dominions of Darnel, that his whole 
army is drefied in cloth that is dyed from thefe. The 
fame gentleman mentions alfo a kind of bean, in his 
pofTeflion, which is alfo ufed in dying, and carried on 
camels for this purpofe, in quantities, to Morocco. There 
are alfo timber trees. Of the latter a fpecies of the 
Ticktonia grandis is found in plenty all over the Gold 
Coaft. This wood is confidered as the heft in the world

Whether the Natives of Africa have not a fufficient fpirlt 
of Commerce,^ as well as a firfficient Portion of Induflry 
among them^ to enihark in a nevj Trade in the Produc- 
tions of their own Country, but whether the Slave-trade 
be not an infuperahle Impediment thereto. 



MR. WADSTROM obferves of the natives of Natives havs 
Africa, that they have a.i. extraordinary gmius for ^"^"(^"yj^'^'^ 
commerce^ and that their induflry is in all regards pro- aZlc^ce 
portionate to their demands, [uffidonfrr 

Confiftently with this idea, we find fome of them not 
only cultivating fuiHcient provifions for themfelves, but 
an overplus for certain towns (Kiernan, Wadilrom> 
Wilfon, and Howe) ; others cultivating corn and rice 
for the {hipping that come among them, (Kiernan, 
Falconbridge, Dove, Bowman, Wadflrom, Hall, New- 
ton) ; others bringing large bundles of rice on their 
heads of forty or fifty pounds weight from the inland 
country to the fea lliore, and then travelling back loaded 
with European goods, (Hall, Storey, Bowman) ; others 
going in armed bodies even a month's journey inland 
with various articles for trade, (Storey) j others wooding 
and watering the fhips, ( T^ alconbridge) ; and others hiring 
themfelves out to the Europeans to work at a lov price 
both in boats and on the Ihore, (Newton, Sir George 
Young, and Thompfon.) 

In fhort, fays Hall, they were never indolent when 
they could work to advantage. They were willing to do 
any thing, fays Morley, for which they had a profpeSi of 

N helng 



( 9^ ) 

Nauveshavihelng pa':d. They were always induftrlous, fays Dal- 

Imlt'ft>y and rymplc, zvhere there was a demand. Bowman believes 

Commerce ^^^7 ^^ould havc put morc land into cultivation than 

fuffidentfor they did when he was there, had a greater Jupply of rice 

m7itwTtad£, i^g^fj ijuanted by the (hipping — they told him that they 

fhould like to trade more in their own produce ; and 

Falconbridge is fo fure, that, if properly encourazed^ they 

would make any change the Europeans pleafed, that he 

is himfelf going again to Jfri. a io make the experiment. 

Mr. Kiernan fpeaks. in the fame terms. They culti- 
rate, fays he, cotton^ indigo^ and tobacco^ but this they do 
for themjehes only ; for though they are never backward 
when encouraged, yet the Europeans have encouraged 
them only to raife provifions, and never the other articles, 

Sutthe j|. |g evident then, from the above accounts, that the 

Trade infu' w<?«? of encouragement is at leaft one reafon why the na- 
perabkimpe- tjves of Afiica do not eftablifh a trade in the produflions 
dime-rit q£ j.j^g|j. Q^j^ country, as enumerated in the lail chapter. 

Now this want of encouragement we trace from Wad- 
ftrom finally to proceed frotn the trade in Jlaves^ for fuch 
conftant encouragement he obferves is given by the mer- 
chants to the Have trade, and the minds of the natives 
are in confequence fo wholly occupied in it, that little or 
no encouragement remains for the other. 

Sir George Young, and Lieutenant Storey, both come 
to the fame conclufion ; and Lieutenant Simpfon avers, 
that on repeatedly afking the black traders what they 
would do tf the JJave trade were aholifbed^ he was re- 
peatedly anfwered that they would /^i?« ^/W out another 
trade. 

Mr. Wadftrom alfo mentions the Jlave trade as an 
impediment to a trade in the natural produclions of the 
country, not only becaufe it diminlfhes the encourage- 
ment of the latter, as juft explained, but becaufe it fub- 
je6ls the natives, who might be willing to follow it, to 
/ be made flaves, for, as he obferves, they dare never gs 

out into the fields unlefi well armed, 

Mr. 



( 99 ) 

Mr. Wadftrom Is fupported In this fecond clrcum- But ti^g 
ftance as a caufe by Captain Wilfon, who, in giving a ^^'. , 
reafon why the flave trade obftrufbs the civilization 3.nd p^^.J,^"'"' 
commerce of the natives, fays, they will not for a tern- hnpcdJmcns 
porary gratification rifque the being kidnapped^ and carried ^^^^'^^°* 
into perpetual JJavery, 

That the flave trade then, either by diminifhing the 
proper encouragement to the natives, or endangering 
their perfons, or by doing both, is the real caufe why 
they do not or cannot exert their induftry in cultivating 
the various articles, which their country has been proved 
to produce, can be afcertained from fa6ts ; for Mr. DaU 
rymple has remarked, that in thofe parts of the coaft 
where there is little or no trade for jlaves^ they are a6lually 
7nore indujirious than in thofe places where the trade ii 
carried on. 

Captain Hall fays alfo, that he found cultivation In hy 
far the higkejl ftate at the ifland of Fernandipo, fo that 
the yams, whicn vv^ere the principal produce there, were 
made to run up like vines upon flicks. But here he 
obferves, firft, that the natives had vreat encouragejnents^ 
for all the (hips from Calabar, Del Rey, and the Came- 
roons, fent their boats there for thefe articles, as to the 
regular market, and, fecondly, that they had no trade in 
jjaves. 

Mr. Falconbridge alfo has occafion to obferve, that at 
Bonny, the mod confiderable place for flaves, there was 
a time in the late war when the flave trade was fo inter- 
rupted, as to ceafe to be carried on, and that on his afking 
the black traders what they had done during this interval, 
they anfwered they had been obliged to cultivate the earth 
for their fupport. 

Mr. How adds, that he has been almoft upon every 
fettlement, that belongs to the Englifh, on the coaft of 
Africa, and that he found the culture always in a higher 
degree^ where there vjas bat little of the Jlave tradc^ and

It appears firft then, that if we look at the feameti ^/^ o/<^"«- 
vvhile employed on board their refpei^ive (hips, and judge "sflveTrlde 
of th?m from the above accounts, we fhall fee the de- <ivhile. h the 
ftru6tive nature of the flave trade, for it appears that m ^^^"^'^^^ '4' 
350 vefiels 12,263 feamen were employed, out of whom ^^^^J^^^^^^ 
2643 were loft, that is to fay, that more than a fifth of 
the whole numhi^r employedy or more i\id.njevcn in every 
fmgle voyage perifhed. 

If again we look at fuch of thein as are difcharged or 
defert in the Weft Indies, where the rnufter-rolls ceafe 
to take an account of them, (for fo fyitematical dc€s the 
management of the trade appear by the fecond and fourth 
columns, that nearly one-half of thofe tvho go out with the ■ 
Jhips are crnflavA-y'^ !,ft behind} and judge of them by 
what the different evidences have to (ay of them there, 
we fhall fee great reafon to apprehend another very fevere 
lofs hefides that already fiated to happen among them while 
pn board their refpeclive fliips. 

To fhew this in the moft unqueftionable manner, we 
may begin with Captain Hall (of the merchants fervice). 
The crews of the African ftiips, fays he, when they 
arrive in the Weft Indies, are generally (he does not 
know a Jingle inflame to the contrary) in a Jlckly^ debilitated 

Jlate^ and the feamen, who are difcharged or defert from 
thofe fhips in the Weft Indies, are the inofl miferahle 
obje^s he ever met with in any country in his life. He 
has frequently feen them with their toes rotted off\ their 
legs fuelled to the fize of their thighs^ and in an ulcerated 

fiate all over. He has ittn them on the different wharfs 
in the iflands of Antigua, Barbadoes, and Jamaica, par- 
ticular v at the two laft iflands. He has alfo feen them 
lying under the cranes and balconies of the houfes near 
the water-fide in Barbadoes and Jamaica expiring^ and 
fome quite dead. He met with an inftance laft July ( 1 789) 
of a d^eadfeaman lying on one of the wharfs in Bridge 
Town, Barbadoes, who had been landed out of an African 
Jlnp. 

* Some of thefe are again taken up by other Cu'nea-men, but very- 
few. When a veird has once fold her flaves, Ihc rec[uircs but few feamea 
to briiig her home.

Lofsamw^ To conflrm the afTertion of Captain Hall, of the mer- 

;2^^^,,^j^j^^. chants fervice, that the crews of Guijiea-men generally 

dejeyt 'If arrive at their deftinrd ports of fale in a fickly^ debilitated 

the iF,/l Jiate^ we may appeal to Captain Hall, of the navy, who 

hJriTliateQi^'^^^^^-> ^^^^ '" taking men (while in the Weft Indies) 

them there, out of merchant fhips for the king's fervice, he has, in 

taking a part of the crew of a Guinea ftiip, whofe number 

then confifted of feventy, been able to feledt but thirtyy 

who could have been thought capable of jerving on board 

zny fhips of war, and when thofe thirty were furveyed 

by order of the admiral, be was reprimanded for bringing 

fuch men into the fervice, who were more likely to breed 

dijlempers than to be of any iife^ and this at a time when 

feamen were fo much wanted, that almnft any thing would 

have beer, taken. He adds alfo that this v^^as not ?l /regular 

inftance, but that it was generally the caf- ; for he had 

many opportunities between the years 1769 and 1773 of 

feeing/';.^ grrat diflrejjes of crews of Guinea Jhlps^ vjhsn 

they arrived in the JVejt Indicia 

We may appeal alfo to Captain Smith, o{ the navy, 
"vi'ho air. rts that though he mav have boarded mar twenty 
of thefe veiTels in the Weft Indies, for the purpofe of 
imprefiing men, he was never able to get more than two 
men. The principal reafon was the fear of infection^ 
having feen many of them in a very difordered and ulcn- 
rated jtate. 

The affertlon alfo of Captain Hall, of the merchants 
fervice, relative to their fituation after their arrival at 
their deftined ports of fale, is confirmed by the reft of 
the evidences in the minuteft manner ; for the feamen 
belonging to the flave-veilels are there defcribed, as lying 
ohout the wharfs and cranes^ or wandering about the 
ftreets or iflands *y«// of fores arid ulcers^ by Jeffreys, 
Dalrymple, El'.ifon, Morlev, Davlfon, Baillie, Towne,

feen carrying by the negroes to be interred. 

As a farther proof, and that an undeniable one, that 
the above defcription of perfons is notorious in the ifiands, 
it appears by the evidence, that they are marked by a 
peculiar and cant-name^ according to the fort of place 
which they ufuaily haunt. When they are feen lying 
about the cranes and wharfs, they are termed wharfingers^ 
when on the beach, and where there are no wharfs. 
Beach- tiorners^ and they are known by the appellation 
oi ScQwbankers at Dominique. 

It may be remarked here, that this difeafed and forlorn 
ftate of the feam^en is fo infepar able from the flave trade^ 
that the different evidences have not only witnefled it at 
Jamaica, Antigua, and Barbadoes, (the places mentioned

of Africa as in the former cafe. There are, however, three fpecies 
'u.'ouu not kc^ prefumption, from whence fome conclufion may be

The firft is the following. Captain Thompfon, when 
on the Coaft of Africa, lay for feveral weeks near a 
veffcl, which traded in wood^ vvory^ and gum^ {which is 
a cafe in point) and he had the beft accounts from his 
officers of the healthinejs and good order of this fhip. 
This, however, is the only veflel of the kind, which any 
ot the evidences have feen. 

A fecond fpecies of prefumption is to be entertained 
from the opinion of thofe, who have vifited the Coaft of 
Africa. The fame Capt. Thompfon fays, that he does 
not think a trade in the natural productions of Africa 
would be fo detrimental to the health of the feamen as 
the flave trade, for they would not be liable to fo much 
unpleafant and hard work, or fuch expofure to dews and 
weather. Mr. Newton alTerts alfo that fuch a trade 
might be carried on without much expofure to weather 
and ill treatment, the * natural attendants of the (lave 
trade : and Sir George Young is of opinion, that a 
trade in the natural produ6lions of Africa would n?ti. be

during the whole of the Middle Pafage^ is acknowledged 
by them ail. 

With refpe(5l to their perfonal ill ufage, the following 
cxtradts may fuffice. 

Mr. Morley alTerts that the feamen in all the Guinea 
men he failed in, except one, were generally treated with 
great rigour, and many with cruelty. He recollects 
many inftances : Mathews, the chief mate of the Venus, 
Captain Forbes, would knock a man down for any fri- 
volous thing with a cat, a piece of wood, or a cook's 
axe, with which he once cut a man down the fhoulder, 
by throwing it at him in a paffion. Captain Dixon 
likewife, in the Amelia, tied up the men, and gave them 
four or five dozen lalhes at a time, and then rubbing 

them 



( 107 ) 

them with pickles made ufe of certain vulgar expreiHons. Bnrbayous 
Mr. Moriey alfo himfelf, when he was Dixon's cabin- f^'ef*^' 
boy, for accidentally breaking a glafs, was tied to ^^ emph^cdm 
tiller by the hands, flogged with a cat, and kept hanging the Slave- 
for fome time. ^'^'^' 

Mr. Moriey has feen the feamen lie and die upon deck. 
They are generally, he fays, treated ill when fick. He 
has known men afk to have their wounds or ulcers 
drefled ; and has heard the do6tor, with oaths, tell them 
to take their own dung and drefs them. 

Mr. Ellifon alfo, in defcribing the treatment in the 
Briton, fays, there was a boy on board, whom Wilfon, 
the chief mate, was always beating. One morning, in 
the palTage out, he had not got the tea-kettle boiled in 
time for his breakfaft, upon which, when it was brought, 
Wilfon told him he would feverely flog him after break- 
faft. The boy, for fear of this, went into the lee fore 
chains. When Wilfon came from the cabin, and called 
for Paddy, (the name he went by, being an Irifh boy) he 
would not come, but remained in the fore chains ; on 
which Wilfon going forward, and attempting to haul 
him in, the boy jumped overboard, and was drowned. 

Another time, on the Middle Pafl'age, the fame Wilfon 
ordered one James AUifon, (a man he had been conti- 
nually beating for trifles) to go into the women's room 
to fcrape it. Allifon faid he was not able, for he was 
very unwell ; upon which Wilfon obliged him to go 
down. Obferving, however, that the man did not 
work, he afked him the reafon, and was anfwered as 
before, " that he was not able." Upon this, Wilfon 
threw a handfpike at him, which ftruck him on the 
breaft, and he dropped down to appearance dead. — • 
Allifon recovered afterwards a little, but died the next 
day. 

Mr. Ellifon relates other inftances of 111 ufage on 

board his own fhip, and with refpe6l to inftances in 

Others, he fays, that in all flave Jhips they are moft com-

Ha-'ba^-ous monly beaten and knocked about for nothing. He re- 

^J^EuV^' colledls that on board the Phcenix, a Briftol ftiip, while 

employed hi Ijing on the coafl-, the boatfwain and five of the crew 

the S^ave- made their efcape in the yawl, but were taken up by the 

' natives. When Captain Bifhop heard it, he ordered 

them to be kept on fhore at Forje, a fmali town at the 

mouth of Calabar River, chained by the necks, legs, 

and hands, and to have each a plantain a day only. The 

boatfwain, whofe name was Tom Jones, and an old 

fhipmate of his, and a very good feaman, dijd raving 

mad in his chains there. The other five died in their 

chains alfo. 

Mr. Towne, in fpeaking of the treatment on board 
the Peggy, Captain Davifon, fays, that their chefts were 
brought upon deck, and fraved and burnt, and themfelves 
turned out from lying below ; and if any murmurs were 
heard among them, they were inhumanly beaten with 
any thing that came in the way, or flogged, both legs 
put in irons, and chained abaft to the pumps, and there 
made to work points and gafkets, during the Captain's 
pleafure •, and very often beat juft as the Captain thought 
proper. He himfelf has often feen the Captain as he 
has walked by, kick them repeatedly, and if they have 
faid any thing that he might deem offenfive, he has im- 
mediately called for a ftick to beat them with ; they, at 
the fame time, having both legs in irons, an iron collar 
about their necks, and a chain j and when on the Coaft 
of Guinea, if not releafed before their arrival there from 
their confinement, they were put into the boats, and 
made to row backwards and forwards, either with the 
Captain from (hip to fhip, or on any other duty, ftill 
both legs in irons, an iron collar about their necks, with 
a chain locked to the boat, and taken out when no other 
duty was required of them at night, and locked faft 
upon the open deck, expofed to the heavy rains and 
dews, without any thing to lie upon, or any thing to 
cover them. This was a practice on board the Peggy. 

He fays alfo, that fimilar treatment prevailed on board 
the Sally, another of the Ihips in v/hich he failed. One 

of 



( 109 ; 



yout 



of the feamen had both legs In irons, ant! a collar about ^^^^'^''^"^ 
his neck, and v/as chained to the boat for three months, ^-/^f^^^,°^ 
and very often moft inhumanly beaten for complaining fj^/^^fii/m 
of his fituation, both by the Captain and other officers, ^be Slaves 
At laft he became fo weak, that he could not fit upon 
the thwart or feat of the boat to row, or do any thing 
p\k. They then put him out of the boat, and made 
him pick oakum on board the iliip, with only three 
pounds of bread a week, and half a pound of fait beef 
per day. He remained in that fituaticn, with both his 
legs in irons, but the latter part of the time without a 
collar. One evening he came zh^ during the Middle 
PaiTage, to beg fomething to eat, or he fliould die. The 
Captain on this inhumanly beat him, and ufed a great 
number of reproaches, and ordered him to go forward, 
and die and be damned. The man died in the night. 
The ill treatment on board the Sally was general. 

As another particular inflance, a landman, one Edw. 
Hilton, was in the ]3oat watering., and complained of his 
being long in the boat without meat or drink. The 
boatfwain, being the officer, beat him with the boat's 
tiller, having nothing elfe, and cut his head in feveral 
places, fo that when he came on board he was all over 
blood. Mr. Towne afked him the reafon of it. Hilton 
began to tell him, but before he could properly tell the 
ftory, the mate came forward, .by order of the captain) 
the furgeon and the boat(V/ain, and all of them toq,ether, 
fell to beating him with their canes. The furgeon ilruck 
him on the lide of his eye, (o that it afterwards morti- 
fied, and was loft. He immediately had both his legs 
put in irons, after he had been fo beat, that he could 
not ftand. The next morning he was put into the boat 
on the fame duty as before, ftill remaining with both 
legs in irons, and locked with a chain to the boat, until 
fuch time as he became fo ueak, that he was not able to 
remain any longer there. He was then put on board the 
fliip, and laid forwards, ftill in irons, very ill. His 
allowance was immediately ftopped, as it was the fur- 
geon's opinion it was the only method of curing any one 
of them who complained of illnefs. He remained in 

tiiat 



( no ) 

Jta^-hm-mn that fituatlon, after being taken out of the boat, for fome 

Vja^eoftbe y^^ecks after. During this time, Mr. 7^owne was obliged 

cm*>ir,[Uin ^^ Z^ ^o J"nk River, and on his return he inquired for 

the Slave- Hilton, and was told that he was lying before the fore- 

Trade, mail, almoft dead. He went and fpoke to him, but 

Hilton feemed infenfible. The fame day Mr. Towne 

received his orders to go a fecond time in the fhallop to 

Junk River. After he had gotten under weigh, ths 

commander of the fliallop was ordered to bring to, and 

take Hilton in, and leave hi?n on fhore any ivhere. He 

lived that evening and night out, and died early the 

next morning, and was thrown overboard ofF Cape 

Mezzurado. 

Mr. Falconbridge, being called upon alfo to fpeak to 
the ill ufage of feamen, fays that on board the Alexander, 
Capt. M'Taggart, he has feen them tied up and flogged 
v/ith the cat frequently. He remembers alfo an inftance 
of an old man, u'ho was boatfwain of the Alexander, 
having one night fome words with the mate, wheii the 
boatfwain was feverely beaten, and had one or two of his 
t^eth knocked out. The boatfwain faid he would jump 
overboard ; upon which he was tied to the rail of the 
quart3r-deck, and a pun.p-bolt put into his mouth by 
way of gagging him. He was then untied, put under 
the half-deck, and a centinel put over him all night — in 
the morning he was releafed. Mr. Falconbridge always 
confidered him as a quiet, inofFenfive man. In the 
fame voyage a black boy was beaten every day, and one 
day, after he was fo beaten, he jumped through one of 
the gun-ports of the cabin into the river. A canoe was 
lying along-fide, which dropped aftern- and picked him 
up. Mr. Falconbridge gave him one of his own fhirts to 
put on, and afked him if he did not expe6l to be de- 
voured by the fharks. The boy faid he did, and that it 
would be much better for him to be killed at once, than 
to be daily treated with fo much cruelty. 

Mr. Falconbridge remembers alfo, on board the fame 
fhip, that the black cook one day broke a plate. For 
this he had a fifh-gig darted at him, which \vou\A 

certainly 



( IIT ) 

t^ertainly have deftroyed him if he had not {looped or ^^^^^^'"^^'^ 
dropped down. At another time alfo, the carpenter's ^/^£'"J^^'^ 
mate had let his pitch-pot catch fire. He and the cook c^piovcd i^i 
were accordingly both tied up, llripped, and flogged, but ^^' ^j^""^^" 
the cook with the greateft feverity. After that the cook '^''* 
had fait water and cayenne pepper rubbed upon his back. 
A man alfo came on board at Bonny, belonging to a 
little Ihip, (Mr. Falconbridge believes the captain's name 
was Dodfon, of Liverpool) wnich had been overfet at 
New Calabar. This man, when he came on board, was 
in a convalefcent ftate. He was feverely beaten one 
night, but for what caufe Mr. Falconbridge knows not, 
upon which he came and applied to Mr. Falconbridge 
for fomething to rub his back with. Mr. Falconbridge 
was told by the captain not to give him any thing, and 
the man was defired to go forward. He went accord- 
ingly, and lay under the forecaftle. Mr. Falconbridge 
vilited him very often, at which times he complained of 
his bruiles. After this, he had a return of his flux, and 
died in about three weeks from the time he was beaten. 
The iaft words he ever fpoke to Mr. Falconbridge were 
(after fhedding tears) " / cannot puni/h him" (meaning 
the captain) '^ but dod will." Thefe are the moft re- 
markable inftances which Mr. Falconbridge recolle6^s. 
He fays, however, that the ill treatment was fo general, 
that only three in this fhip efcaped being beaten out of 
fifty perfons. 

To thefe inftances, v/hich fell under the eyes of the 
evidences now cited, we may add the obfervations of a 
gentleman, who, though never in the flave-ti-ade, had 
yet great opportunities of obtaining information upon 
this fubje(Sl. Sir George Young remarks, that thofe 
feamen, whom he faw in the flave-trade, while on the 
coaft in a man of war, complained of their ill treatment, 
bad feeding, and cruel ufage. 'Fhey ^// of them wanted 
to enter on board his fhip. It was likewife the cuitom 
for the feamen of every fhip he faw at a diftance, to 
come on board him v/ith their boats j moft of them quite 
naked^ and threatening to turn pirates^ if he did not take 
them. This they told him openly. Fie is perfuaded, if

• from the woods, where they had no fubfiftence, but to 

which they had fled for refuge from their refpedlivc 

veiTels. 

ThisUfage That the above are not the only inftances of barbarity 
^"•'^"'''^''°'' contained in the evidence, and that this barbarous ufage 

Jpnngi/!g out , ~ . . f. , . f 

of the wry IS pcculiar to, or iprmging out of the very nature of the 
Nature of the trdidQ in flavcSj maybe infifted on from the following 
'^t accounts: 

Captain Hall, (of the merchants fefvice) believes the 
feamen are in general treated with great barbarity in the 
ilave-fliips, and he does not know of their being ill 
treated in any other fervice. 

Captain Thompfon concludes, from the many com- 
plaints he received from feamen, while on the coaft, that 
they are far from being well treated on board t\\Q JIave- 
Jhips. One Bowden fwam from the Fifher, of Liverpool, 
Captain Kendal, to the Nautilus, amidft a number of 
fharks, to claim his proteftion. Kendal wrote for the 
man, who refufed to return, faying his life would be 
endangered. He therefore kept him in the Nautilus till 
file was paid off, and found him a diligent, willing, 
a6tive feaman. Several of the crew, he thinks, of the 
Brothers, of Liverpool, Captain Clark, fwam towards 
the Nautilus, when paffing by. Two only reached her. 
The reft, he believes, regained their own fhip. The 
majority of the crew had the day before come on board 
the Nautilus in a boat to complain of ill ufage, but he 
had returned them with an officer to inquire into and 
redrefs their complaints. He received many letters from 
feamen in flave-fhips, complaining of ill ufage, and de- 
firing him to proted: them, or take them on board. He is 
inclined to think, xh^^t/hips trading in the produce of Africa^ 
are not Jo ill ufed as thoje in the Jlave-fkips. Several of his 
own officers gave him the beft accounts of the treatment 

in 



( 113 ) 

in the /m, a vdTel trading for wood^ gums-^ arid Ivcfy^ near "^^'^^^agt 
which the Nautilus lay for fome weeks. fprVgLt^ out 

of the very 

Lieutenant Simpfon fays, that on his firfl voyagCj when 'future of ^ 
lying at rort Appolonia, tne rly Cj-uineaman was in the_^^^^^^ 
roads. On the return of the Adventure's boat from the 
fortj they were hailed by fome feamen belonging to the 
Fly, requefting that they might be taken from on board 
the Guineaman, and put on board the man of v/ar, for 
that their treatment was fuch as to make their lives 
miferable. The boat, by the dire6i:ion of Capt. Parry, 
was fent to the Fly, and one or two men were brought 
on board him. In his fecond voyage, he recolle6ls, that 
on firft feeing the Albion Guineaman, fhe carried a prefs 
of fail, feemingly to avoid them, but finding it imprac- 
ticable, (he fpoke them ; the day after which the Captain 
of the Albion brought a feaman on board the Adventure, 
whom he wifhed to be left there, complaining that he 
was a very riotous and diforderly man. The man, on 
the contrary, proved very peaceable and well-behaved, 
nor v/as there one fmgle inftance of his conduit, from 
which he could fuppofe he merited the chara6ter given 
him. He feemed to rejoice at quitting the Albion, and 
informed Mr. Sim.pfon, that he was cruelly beaten both 
by the captain and furgeon ; that he was half ftarved ; 
and that the furgeon neglefted the fick feamen, alleging 
that he was only paid for attending the {laves. He alio 
informed Mr. Simpfon, that their allowance of provifions 
was increafed, and their treatment fome what better when 
a man of v/ar was on the coaft. He recolle6ls another 
inftance of a feaman, with a leg fhockingly ulcerated, 
requefting a paflage in the Adventure to England ; 
allegin? that he was left behind from a Guineaman. He 



'iD'"& 



alleged various inftances of ill treatment he had received, 
and confirmed the failor of the Albion's account, that their 
allowance of provifions W2^s increafed, and treatment 
better, when a man of war was on the coaft. During 
Mv. Simpfon's ftay at C. Coaft Caftle, the Adventure's 
boat was fent to Annamaboe to the Spy Guineaman-^ on 
her return, three men were concealed under her fails, 
Vrho had left the flave-fhip— they complained their trcat- 
P ment 



( "4 ) 

ThtsUjage ment was- fo bad, that their lives were mlferable on 

peculiar to or \^Q2_r^ — beaten and half ftarved. — There were various 

onWve ''"'other inftances which efcape his memory. Mr. Simpfon 

Nature cf fays, however, that he has never heard any complaints 

the Troiie in Jroni Weft hidiamen^ or other merchant Jhips ; — on the 

- '^'"' contrary, they wifhed to avoid a man of vjar \ whereas, 

if the captain of the Adventure had liHened to all the 

complaints made to him from lailors of flave-fhips, and 

removed them, he muft have greatly diftrejfed the African 

trade. 

Captain Hall, of the navy, fpeaking on the fame fub- 
je6l, aflerts, that as to peculiar modes of punifhment 
adopted in Guineamen, he once faw a man chained by 
the neck in the main top of a flave-fhip, when paffing 
under the ftern of his Majefty's fhip Crefcent, in King- 
fton-Bay, St. Vincent's ; and was told by part of the 
crew, taken out of the fhip, at their own requeft^ that 
the man had been there one hundred and twenty days. He 
fays he has great reafon to believe, that in no trade are 
J4a7nen fo badly treated as in the flave-trade^ from their 
alzUays fiying to men of war for redrefs, and whenever 
they come within reach ; whereas m^nfrom Weft Indian 
sr other trades feldom apply to a Jhip of war.* 

The laft evidence, whom perhaps it will appear ne- 
cefTary to cite on this occafion, is the Rev. Mr. Newton, 
This gentleman agrees in the f ill ufage of the feamea 

* The circumftance of feamen in the Slave-trade being defirous of 
leaving their fhips, and of thofe in other trades ftaying by them, whea 
in fight of men of v/ar, is confirmed alfo by Captains Smith and Wilfon, 
of the navy. 

-f- It will be proper to mention here, that fcveral fpecifick fa£l:s of the 
ill treatment cf feamen in ihe Slave-trade have been omitted in thefc 
accounts, as weli as that this ill ufage is confirmed by more of the wit- 
nelTes, viz. Trotter, Dove, Parker, Storey, and Forfter; on the other 
hand, about {tvtin captains may be traced, three of whofe names only- 
are mentioned, (viz. Butler, Smith, and Frazer) who have had the merit 
of going againfl the current of bad example in the abufe of feamen in this 
trade. If it fhould be afked how it happens that leamen coter for flave- 
veffelsjwhen fuch general ill ufage there can hardly fail of being known, 
the reply muft be taken from the evidence, ** that whereas fome of them 
enter voluntarily, the greater part of them are trepanned, for that it is 
the bufinefs of certain landlords to make them^ intoxicated, and get theni 
into debt, after which their only altermtm is a Cuincaman or a gaoV 

alluded

alluded to, and believes that the JIave-trade itfelf is a ihh Ufage 
great caufe of it, for he thinks that the real or fuppofed pectdiar to or 
neceffity of treating the negroes with rigour gradually ^^''"^^^'^^J^^ 
brings a numbnefs upon the heart, and renders moft of thofe Nature of 
who are engaged in it too indifferent to the fufferings of their ^^^ Trade in 
fellow ^creatures ; and he fuppofes there is no trade in '^^^'^^'^' 
which feamen are treated with fo little humanity as in 
the African flave-trade. He has himfelf feen the failors,

This, hov/ever, is fo far from being the cafe, that, as 
Mr. H. Rofs obferves, though on another occafion, 
any comparifon between the ftate of the two is an * in- 
fult to common fenfe. The (laves in Africa are rnen^

labouring poor of this country : but it has been moft amply refuted by 
Woolrich, Captain Wilfon, Jeffreys^, Rees, Dean of Middleham, and 
H, Rofs, the latter of whom, though he compared the difterent circumi-

Nov/, if the lives of the flaves in Africa fhould be fo 
much happier (as may be feen by comparing the above 
accounts with thofe in Chap. IV.) than the lives of the 
flaves in the European colonies, it will not be doubted 
that freemen in the former parts of the world mufl be 
happier than flaves in the latter. 

Though the obfervations already made might be fuf- 
ficient (both v/ith refpeft to fuch as having been origi- 
nally freemen, and fjch as having been originally * flaves

nies) to difprove the affertion infmuated in the title to 
this chapter, yet as there are other very llrong proofs 
in the evidence, it would be unpardonable not to cite 
them in the prefent cafe. 

Mr. M. Cook has often heard Africans in the 'SN' q'^ A''ricandQv&

Fitzmaurice, Clappefon, Baill.ie, Dalrymple, Davifon, 
Dean of Pvliddleham, Captain Rofs, and Wooirich, all 
agree inthis fa61:. The caufes of it are defcribed in ge-

dcpoy than- ^ble, as v/e find from Mr. Coor, that thefe acts of def- 
Jelvesmthc pej-^tion fhould have been fo frequent as to have occa- 
fioned It to have palled into an obiervation, " that the 
Gold Coaft negroes, when driven to defpair, always cut 
their throats^, and thofe of the moft inland country mojlly 
hang themfelves. 

To give a few extra61:s from the evidences on this 
occafion. A negro boy of his, fays Dr. Harrifon, de- 
tefted flavery fo much that he refufed all fupport^ which 
brought on a dropfy that killed him. Another negro, 
who had been a great man in his own country, refufed to 
work for any white man, and being therefore punifhed 
by the overfeer, he defired him to tell his mailer that he 
would he a fiave to no man. His mafter ordered him to 
be removed to another eftate. His hands were tied be- 
hind him, and in going over a bridge he jumped into 
the water and appeared no more. 1 hefe are two fadls 
of Dr. Harrifon's own knowledge, out of a great many 
which he cannot now recolledt. 

Mr. Fitzmaurice has known too many fuicides^ 
among new negroes efpecially, both by hanging them- 
felves and dirt-eating, which they knew to he fatal. He 
loft one year twelve new negroes by it, though he fed 
them well. On his remonftrating they conftantly told 
him they preferred dying to living, A great proportion 
of the new negroes that go on fugar eftates, d^ie in this: 
way, 

A planter, fays Mr. Woolrich, p^^-'-afed fix men 
fiaves out of a Guinea fhip, and \ -nem on a fmall 
illand to plant cotton. They had a ..ite man with them 
as overfeer, who left them of a Saturday night. There 
were no white inhabitants on the ifland. On the Mon- 
day following the overfeer returned, when he found all' 
the fix hanging near together in the woods, Mr. Wool- 
rich often inquired of the moil fenfible negroes what 

could 



( 119 ) 

could be the caufe of fuch ailions, and the anfwer was, 
** that they would rather die than live in the fituation 
they were in,''

from the idea that the deceafed are returning home, 

Mr. Douglas faw three funerals of Guinea fiaves in 
the Weft Indi^. At thefe funerals, fays he, they fmgy 
and are merry ^ and, naming the deceafed, fay, he is gone 
to Guinea, . ^ 

Great rejoicings^ fays Cook, are made by African 
negroes at the funerals of each other, from a belief 
that the deceafed are gone to their own country agai?2, 

African negroes, fays Forfter, fhewed the mofi ex- 
travagant joy at their friends funerals, from believing 
the deceafed gone back to their country. 

Captain Wilfon confirms the above by ftating, that 
he never faw any figns of happinefs among the imported 
jlaves^ except at their funerals, when they Ihew extra- 
'uagant joy^ from a perfuafion that the deceafed is efcaped 
from jlavery to his ovjn country. Captain Wilfon, how- 
ever, does not ftop here, for he goes on to declare, that 
in Africa their funerals are attended vjith the mojl mourn-' 
ful cries.

Lieutenant Davifon confirms the account given of 
Mr. Malcolm's eftate : that gentleman, he iays, had not 
bought a negro for ten or twelve years, during which 
time the flaves had confiderably increafed. Lieutenant 
Davifon alfo knew an eftate, where the negroes were

Mr. M. Cook knew two eftates in the fame ifland, 
on which he really believes the negroes to have in-

went there, was a fmall one, not for want of land but 



( 122 ) 

Eftatcs irithe^^ negroes. This eftate at that time made about fihj 

Colonies 071 hogflicads of fugar yearly. In confequence, however, of 

luhich the prood urao;e the net>;roes increafed fo faft (the children 

>t,^^f /„^^f^r. leeming to Iwarm on this eltate) that, before IVir Coor 

'td by births, quitted the ifland, Mr. Dunn had not only doubled the 

produce, but had fettled another ejhte out of it^ which 

made fixty hogftieads per year, and he had never bought 

but fix new negroes in the whole time. 

In the fame ifiand, and parifh of Clarendon, the ne- 
gioes on Ramfbury eflate increafed fo faft, fays Mr. 
Fitzm^Ur^ce, that a gang of them was drawn ofF to 
fettle a new eftate, called Yarmouth, which he had then 
the care of, but the fettlem.ent was difcontmued from the 
change of the attorney. On Orange, in St. James's, 
no negroes vv^ere bought for at leaft fifteen years, and 
they increafed ; as alio on Eden in the fame pariih. 
He lived on both thefe eftates. 

Mr. Forfter, fpeaking of the ifland of Antigua, fays, 
that on the whole of Colonel Farley's plantations they 
had no need of new negroes. He has b^ard the Colonel 
fay there v/as a confiderable increafe, but on one particu- 
larly. Mr. Thomas Gravenor's negroes alfo increafed. 
He knew Captain Thomafon, of Seacow Bay, Tortola, 
who wanted no nev7 negroes for many years. 

Mr. Duncan obfervxs, that the treatment on the 
eftate that he lived on, which was in the ifland of 
Antigua, was better than common : the effe6l was 
that the flaves increafed. The flaves alfo on Sir G. 
Thomas's Belfaft eftate, and Carlifle's, and feveral 
others he cannot now name increafed, or kept up their 
numbers without any addition by purchafe. 

Mr. Giles fays, that on two eftates where he lived, the 
increafe of the flaves, under a milder treatment in the 
ifland of St. Croix, exceeded their decreafe by one per 
cent. 

Captain 



( 123 ) 

Capt. Hall, of the navy, mentions an eftate, belonging 'P^ptes hi tht 
to the Marquis de Rouvray, in the Ifland of St. Domingo, J^!-XX" 
where in confequence of good ufage the flaves increafed Africans 
fo faft as to have rendered any farther purchafes unne- ^^^^ ino-eaf^ 
celTary. ^^^-^"''^'" 

Mr. Biihop told Mr. Town, that in a plantation of 
his, in Barbadoes, they had not bought a Guinea negro 
for upwards of forty years, and that by good ufage there 
were a great many more now there than formerly. 

The Reverend Mr. Davies fays, that on Kendal plan- 
tation, in the iiland of Barbadoes, belonging to Mr. 
Steel, the ftock of flaves was kept up by births. He 
knew alfo a fev/ other eftates which kept up their num- 
bers v^ithout importation. 

The Dean of Middleham, while in Barbadoes, under- 
ftood from Dr. Mapp's fon, that the itock on the eftat?, 
to v/nich he had jull fucceeded, had increafed fo much by 
birth, that there was a redundance fufficient nearly to 
flock another eftate. The Rev. Mr. Carter's flaves alfo 
increafed confiderably, and thefe cultivated his glebe and 
planted canes. The Dean's brother alfo informed him, 
that his own negroes had doubled their number by natu- 
ral increafe in twenty years, and they were employed, he 
believes, in common field bufmefs as other negroes. The 
Dean had heard of fi-veral others of his acquaintance, who 
had kept up their Itocks by the natural increafe, without 
purchafe. 

Having now mentioned thofe eflates, on v/hich it ap- Other faihu 
pears that the flaves have increafed by birth, it will ^^-^^i^-^. 
proper to mention thofe other h'Sis in the evidence, hy "c re nk by hinh 
which it will be clear, that the Africans by general good if wJl i<jcd. 
ufage will increafe fo generally as to fuperfede the ne- 
ceffity of the flave-trade. 

I. In the Ifland of Barbadoes the field flaves appear 

to he better ircated than elfewherc. Accordingly we find 

from Mr. Woodward, that while refident there, in the 

Q^ 2 years 



( IH ) 

Qtheyfais ygars 1782 and 1783, he never heard any complaint of 
to j'hciv t?(y 1^ vvant of neo;roes to carry on the plantation or other 
crcafc h ^y^r/hhufinefs . And yet he does not recolledi: the Jale of a 
ifwcilujcd, fmgle cargo of f laves during that time. 

2, Field flaves cultivating cotton., pimento, and cofFee, 
are defcribed by Mr. Cook as being treated better^ and as 
incrcafmgfajler by birth than thole employed on fugar 
efiiates. 

3, Dome/lies are univerfally faid to be treated better 
on the whole than fieid flaves, and thefe are generally faid 
t'} increifd. There are many more children, fays Jeffreys, 
among domeftlcs \k\2,\-\ fie. d flaves. Captain Hall fiys, that 
in his time the dotmftics uue'-e underftood to increaje by birth ^ 
and Lieutenant Davifon, that they did aSlually increafe, 
Mr. Forfler gives an inflance of rapid increafe among 
the domeftics. A v^idow Shervington -was left in debt 
with five or fix negroes, wh6 by kind treatment in fifteen 
or twenty years increafed to fifteen or more. He knows 

Jeveral inftances of the kind, 

4. The Maroon negroes, originally Africans, who 
live in fmall communities in Jamaica, as free people, and 
who of courfe are not [idjeB to ill if age like the flaves^ are 
faid to increafe alfo. M. Cook believes the Maroon 
negroes to be increafing very faft. Lieutenant Davifon 
afierts, that in his time xhe.y increafed moft certainly. He 
has often been iii all their towns, and always faw great 
numbers of children. Their numbers were confiderably 
more when he left, than when he came to the ifland. Jt 
wa? impoliible for them to have received any addition of 
pumber from other quarters. 

5. African negroes alfo, when tranfported to the Baft 
Indies^ have, by good ufage^ increafed the e. Mr. Botham 
fays, that in the year 1 764, the Eaft India Company fent 
flave fhips to Africa and Madagafcar, and trarj"ported to 
Bencoolen, for their public and other works, nearly a thou- 
fand fiaves, and in much the fame proportion of men, wo- 
mcRj and children, as thej^ are carried from Africa to the 

Weft 



{ 125 ) 

Weft Indies, that is, more men than women and children, ^^^-j^'fi^^ 
Thefe flaves, on the firft years of their arrival, from ih<^ ^Jouidin-^ 
iinhealthinefs of the climate^ and other caufes, decreafed '. cr^ajt hv bh-th 
but when they had been at Bencoolen a ^^w years, where 'J^jMnjcd, 
they were humanely treated^ they began annuady to increaje ; 
notwithftanding from the little attention that v/as paid to 
their v/ay of life, both men and women lived in the moft 
abandoned way. The v/onder was, that they did increafe, 
as the young women flaves were commosi proilitutes to 
the foldiers and failoia. 

6. African negroes alfo, tranfported to dilFerent parts 
of North America, have, in confequence of being ^'better 
iijed^ increafjd by population there. 

Dr. Harrifon's diilinilion between the difference of 
the treatment of the ne iroes by the Weft Indians and 
Am.ericans, is as follo.vs. In Jamaica, he fays, flaves 
were generally treated ill, and only individuals treated 
them well ; in Carolina, on the other hand, they were 
generally treated well, and only individuals ufed them ill. 
—Let us now fee the confequences. 

Mr. Dove fays, that from 1774. to 1783 there were no 
importations of flaves to Bofton or New York, and yet 
he thinks that they did not decreafe in their number 
during that time. 

It was generally believed, fays Mr. Stuart, that the 
Carolina flaves increafed without importation. 

Mr. Savage fays alfo, that where they were well ufed 
in Carolina they increafed greatly. A friend of his, 
Gabriel Manigault, Efq. informed him, that in 1737, 
he had on his eflate eighty-fix negroes, of which twelve 
or fourteen were fuperannuated. The latter he replaced 
by others. With no more addition than this, they had 
increafed to two hundred add feventy about a year or two 
(1773) before he left the country. 

* The evidences unanimnufly maintain, that their ufage is better In 
America than in the Weft Indies. 

Mr. Baillie 



( n6 ) 

Oihoyfa^s Mr. Balllie alfo, fpeaking of Carolina, believes the 

'^''''wV'^'-^ negroes are raifed there in as great a proportion as children 

create bylirth^n Europc, whcn they ?re in healthy fituations, notwith- 

i/'ivtUuJid. ftanding which he obferves, that the cultroation of rice 

is as labor'wui as that of fugar^ and that the climate of 

"Jamaica is much more favourable to the conjlitution of the 

negroes ihan that of Carolina. 

Dr. Flarrifon alfo gives his opinion as a medical man, 
that the climate of Jamaica is more favourable to the 
increafe of (laves than that of Carolina ; notwithftanding 
which difadvantage Carolina increajed in flaves^ while 
thofe in famaica decreafd* 

Mr. Irving mentions the increafed population of flaves 
by birth in Carolina to have been reckoned in his time at 
JrQ?n two to ten per cent, and yet he fpeaks of the climate 
in the fame ma7ijur as the rejt, "The breeding of faves^ he 
fays, was confidered fo advantageous^ that the planter 
generally valued a cliild, on the day of its birth, at five 
pounds. 

Mr. Clapham., examined on this fubje6l, for Maryland, 
fays, the negroes kept up their numbers there by propa^ 
gation, and increafed, fo that the overplus^ in fome in- 
ffances, were Jhitped to the Weft Indies. He has known 
an hundred fales- where proprietors have had too many for 
their uje^ in confequence of increafe by propagation, yet 
they were not thought to be * v/eii treated, though better 
than to the fouthward, and the climate was fubj.cl to great 
andfudden variety of heat and cold, 

Mr. Beverley, examined refpe<5ling Virginia, ftates, 
that the negroes there always kept up their numbers, and 
generally increafed. His father's more than doubled their 
numbers. In 1761 he had about two hundred, and in 
1788 he paid taxes on above five hundred and forty, of 
whom "not above twenty or thirty had been added by 
purchafe. 

* The evidence warrants us in faying, that a ilave in America, faid 
Xq, be not ^Yell ufed, would be confidered as well ufed in the Weft-lndie§: 

Mr. Beverley 



( 127 ) 

Mr. Beverley was told in America, that v»rhen the '^^'^-'' .'^'^^^" 
abolition of the Have-trade was firft agitated in 1774)!^^' /J J.''*' 
many doubted the pracSlicabihty of keeping up the num- creak iyt:>-Th 
bers by births, and the perfons fo doubting have, fince -i/'^-'^^^^'*^' 
the abolition of the fiave trade, exprefled to him a con^ 
•ui^i.on that their fears were groundlejs. 

Mr. Crew flates alfo, that the negroes In Virginia 
increafed rapidly without importation, fo much (o^ that 
it was a general opinion that it was profitable to holdjiaves 
on this account^ exclufwe of the profits of their labour. 
He thinks, at the fame time, that the culture of tobacco 
is nearly as laborious as that of fiigar^ and that the climate 
of Virginia is not fo favourable as that of the Weft Indies 
to African conftitutions on account of i\\Q fever e * cold in 
the ivinier* Mr. Crew obferves, that the importation of 
African flaves into Virginia has been generally difcon-- 
tinued fince 1772. 

From the above accounts, fby which the natives ofO.'byrjac^s 
Africa have been viewed in different climates and fituz-'^'^fj^f^^^^ 
tions) but particularly from the lad:, it is evident that^6;j//%'A2, 
if they were in general Vv^ell ufed in the European colo- 
nies, they would fo generally increafe. as to fuperfede 
the neceffity of the flave trade^ for if in the American cli- 
mate, totally uncongenial to their conftitutions, they have 
generally increafed by births, much more v/ould they in 
the Vv'^efl: Indian, which is reprefented as much more fa- 
vourable to their propagation. 1 his will be flill more 
evident, if we prove that they are prolifick in their 
own country, and that the Weft Indian climate is the 
fame as their own at home. Mr. Falconbridge fays, 
that the females are more prolifick than thofe of other 
countries. Out of four or five deliveries, at which he 
was prefent, there Vv^ere twice twins. Captain Hall has 
feen as many children in the towns and villages in Africa 
in proportion to the grown people, as he has met with 
in this country. Sir G. Young declares, that the negro 

* As a farthf:r proof, that the climate of North America is not con- 
genial to the African conlliiution, it appears from Bailie and Beverley that; 
the negroes are always healthier m thcjunmer than ia the winter. 

women 



( 128 ) 

Other fias women on the coafl of Africa appeared to him 2LSprolifick 
7tfniomrn ^^ ^"-^ ^'^^^ of people he ever faw in any part of the world, 
this Jubju'h and the climate o^ the Weft Indies to he not lefs favourable 
to them than their own. Hence he fays, the ftoclc of 
ilaves might be kept up or increafed withnut any importa- 
tions from Africa, At firft the deficiencies might be telt 
for a few, perhaps twenty years^ but after a while, they 
would double their numbers^ for he fees no phyfical caufc 
to prevent a black man and woman being equally prolifick 
in the Weft Indies as in Africa, 

There are others, who from their experience in the 
Weft Indies are of a fimilar opinion. Dr. Jackfon can- 
not conceive, if flaves were well ufed, why they fhould 
not keep up their numbers. They are naturally prolifick^ 
and the iflands in general congenial to their conjl'itutions. — 
It is the opinion of Mr. Coor, that, with kind and ju- 
dicious treatment of the infants, the flaves in Jamaica 
would increafe without any importations from Africa. Mr. 
Davies fays \kvQ fame thing for Barbadoes. Mr. Wood- 
ward is not apprehenfive that the abolition of the flave- 
trade would ruin his Weft Indian property. He thinks it 
would be of advantage to Barbadoes, By ufmg them 
well, and by good management, the ftock of Ilaves would 
naturally increafe without importation. And Mr. Giles 
believes, that, if they were properly treated, their increafe 
would be general throughout the iflands.

What appear to have been the principal caiifes^ implied in 
the term Good Ufage^ of the Increafe by Births^ in the 
Injiances mentioned-^ and what Regulations ought to take 
place in the general praSiice of the Colonies-^ to infure an 
univerfal increafe. 



THE caufes of the increafe by births, on one of the ^'i^^^f^j^ 
eftates mentioned, viz. on the Marquis de Ko\w - %^l^^£,^ 
ray's of St. Domingo, are defcribed by Captain UdWincnafi by 
as follows : popukuon. 



The flaves were never hard prelTed in their workb 
The Marquis fufFered no improper intercourfe between 
the males and females : every man had his own wife^ 
and no white was fufFered to disjoin that union. Hof- 
pitals were built for the fick and pregnant. The latter, 
when far advanced, were taken in there, and employed 
in trifling work, till the time of their delivery. Here 
they might remain, feparated from their huibands, and 
excufed from field labour, till the child could be fupported 
without the mother's help, or when their flrength would 
perm.it, return with the child to their hufbands, and take 
the chance of work. In confequencc, the Marquis had 
not, for fome years, occafion to buy negroes. Having, 
however, left his eilate to the care of a nephew, upon 
his return, after an abfence of two years, inflead of the 
happinefs that reigned v.'hen he left it, he found nothing. 
but mifery and dilcontent. The whites had feized upon 
R ' the 



( 130 ) 

pyhrf-al (j^g pretty women : their hufband?, through dlfcontent, 
T£oi'{ ^^^^ away, and the labour falHng heavier upon the reft, 
:ncreafe by they bccamc difcontented, and their work was badly carried 
population, on : fo that it coft him two years, before he could re- 
eftablifti order. It was a pleafure to walk through his 
eilate ; for the flaves ufed to look upon him as a father. 

It is of Importance to cite this eflate, becaufe, in con- 
fequence ot the above regulations, its gang increafed ; 
becaufe v/hen they were violated it v/ent back; and be- 
caufe, when thev were re-eftablifhed) it v/as reftored to 
its former ftate. Thefe regulations alfo include all the 
regulations, except two, in confequence of which the 
flaves increafed by births on the other eflates mentioned 
in the preceding chapter, and therefore the citation of 
thefe, in particular, avoids a repetition, and faves time. 
The two regulations not included in thefe, are the fol- 
lowing : — Mr. Giles afTerts, that the purchafnig of a 
few mules, on an eftate which he managed, to carry the 
canes which the negroes had before this been accuftomed 
to carry on their heads, fo lightened their labour, as to 
occafion them to increafe in population, whereas they 
had decreafed before : and, on the eflate cited by Lieut. 
Davifon, the circumftance of Mr. Malcolm's going 
among his ov/n negroes, hearing their complaints, and 
not fuffering them to be punifhed without his knowledge, 
are reckoned amons; the caufes that contributed to their 
increaie. 

Somegeim-al Let US no'V fee what is the general pra61:Ice in the 
colonies, and what alterations fhouid be made in it, to 

infure an univerfai increafe. 

I, It is the opinion of Mr. Fitzmaurlce, as obferved 
in chap. 4., that the forcing the Haves to labour beyond 
their ftrength, is the m.eans of bringing many of them 
to the grave. Mr. Bail lie fays, that many of their com- 
plaints arofe from extreme fatigue, and that a little reft 
generally reftored them, without any medicine being 
necelTary- In general, fays Forfter, the planters have 
no idea of improvements to eafs their ilaves. It feemed" 

a general 



p'-arrucs m 



( 131 ) 

a general opinion, that, if negroes were not conftantly Someg^nsr 
kept at work, they would become unruly. ^hfcohiks 

2. We have feen. In chap. 4, the very trifling faults, 
for which (laves are frequently puniihed, at the difcretion 
of the overfeer, and the unlimited fe verity of thofe pu- 
liifhments by the chain, dungeon, ftocks, proje61:ing iron 
collar, iron boot, cov^^fkin, cart-whip, picket, and the 
like ; all of which have a manifeft tendency to harrafs 
human nature, and, in conjunction with other caufes, to 
fubdue it. 

3. It appears that no attention Is paid to the marriage 
of the flaves, fo that one man fhould be reilrifted to one 
wife, but that there is a promifcuous intercourfe amongft 
one another as they pleafe, (General Tottenham, Capt. 
Smith, Sir G. Young, Forfter, Coor) ; and that this is 
not only the cafe of the negroes one with another, but 
with the negro women and the whites, the latter of whom 
violate the chaPcity of the former at difcretion, (Dean of 
Middleham, Captain Smith, Davifon, Cook, Harrifon, 
Coor, and Dalrymple). If the v/omen are fent for by 
the overfeers, fays Cook, for thefe purpofes, they ?nu/l 
come or he flogged^ and to fuch a pitch has Dalrymple 
known this intercourfe to proceed, that female flaves 
are oirered by their mafters, even to thofe who vifit 
them, and he has known compuljion ufed to oblige fuch 
to fubmit to proftitution. 

4. It appears again, from chap. 4, that pregnant 
women, to get the mofi: out of them, ?.re frequently 
worked within a very little time of their delivery, and (o 
hard and fo near to this period, that they often mifcarry, 
as well as that, even in this fituation, they are not exempt 
from the whip. 

5. The fides of the huts, fays Coor, in which the 
pregnant women are delivered, and children born, are 
no more defence againft the cold night damps, than one 
of our pafture hedges. Bedding they have none, but a

Som pntyaJ\^02ir6. ov bafs mat. The infant, for the firfi: eight days, 

""'" ' is never put to the mother's bread, but given to a 

woman out of the field, vv^ho nurfes it, and who proba- 
bly has a child two, three, or four months old : and 
here Mr. Coorfubinits it to medical men what efFedl the 
milk of a woman hardly v/rought and badly fed would 
have on a tender infant. They mofdy die convulfed 
about the eighth day. This want of care is the more 
lamentable, becaufe, if they furvive the eighth da}'-, they 
moftly do well. What convinces him farther it is for 
want of care, is, becaufe, where they have warm hoiifesy 
kind treat?nent^ and the child fet to the mother* $ hreafl^ he 
very feldom knev/ any die. 

Moft of the negro-houfes, fays Fltzmaurice, are open 
to the weather, being v/attled v^ithout plaifter. They 
fleep on a board on the ground, near the fire, and after 
it goes out, they fufFeryr(?/^z colda?id da?np. This caufes 
many diforders, efpecially to lying-in women, who lofe 
more children by this than any other caufej as they gene- 
rally die of the locked jaw. 

6. The Dean of Middleham fays, it ftruck him, to 
fpeak generally, that negro mothers commonly went into 
the field too early after their delivery, taking their children 
with them ; that the rrAlk of the mother became feverifh 
with labour, and the heat of the fun was too powerful 
for the child, v/hich was commonly expofed in a bafket, 
and, in rainy weather, unllieltered. The farne is con- 
firmed by others. 

It is evident then, if the above be the general prac- 
tice in the Colonies ; if the flaves are over- wrought 
and haftily and feverely puniflied ; if promifcuous in- 
tercourfe be allowed; if the women are opprelTed dur^ 
ring their pregnancy; if, while lying-in, they and their 
infants are fo much expofed to damp and cold in their 
houfes, that many of the latter periih : and if, after 
delivery, they are too foon hurried, with their furviving 
infants, into the field, it is evident, we repeat, that they

2. A more general refidence of proprietors on their 
own eftates, as on Mr. Malcolm's, to attend to the 
complaints and punifhments of their flaves, is ne- 
ceffary. 

3. Marriage, or the union of one man to one wo- 
man, fnould take place, as in the Marquis de Rouvray's 
plantation; and this union no white or other perfon 
ihould be fufFered to difturb or disjoin. 

4. The v/omen flaves, when advanced In their 
pregnancy four months, fhould be taken from the field, 
and fliould have little and light work, as praftifed on 
fome of the eflates cited to have increafed by births. 

5. During the time of their lying-in, they fhould be 
put into convenient hofpitals. Or, if allowed to remain 
in their huts, thefe fhould be fo conftru6led as to exclude 
the cold and damp, and every female fhould fuckle her 
own child from the birth. 

6. In fuch hofpitals or huts, they fhould remain, as 
on the Marquis de Rouvray's eftate, and beexcufed from 
field-labour, till the child could be fupported without 
the mother's aid, or, when their ilrengtn would permit, 
return with the child to their hufbands, and take the 
chance of work. 

Now,

Some Alitf' Now, if it could be made appear, as it can, that the 

'^^'>'^'>^' flaves in fome of the eftates cited, increafed by the 

ncafary adoption of fome one of the above regulations alone, 

for infurin? and that they increafed on others by adopting two or three 

tm wnverjal ^^ them, and no more, and that on no one eftate, as 

appears by the evidence, were all of them in force at a 

time, it is plain, that if all of them combined were put 

into execution on each and every eftate in the colonies, 

there muft be an univerfal increafs of the Haves there »

WE have found, that lightening the labour of the EvJdenee 
flaves, attending to their grievances, punifh-A^^5^-^°^'^*^" 
ments, and the like, have been the means of contribut- ^^J^^J/J 
ing to their increafe by population ; hence any new modes accelerate

I. Let the plough be introduced on every eftate ^^^^^ %'^ 
which will admit the ufe of it. ReguMom 

are. 

The introdudlion of the plough would, in the opinion 
of Forfter, Sir G. Young, Rees, Harrifon, Giles, and 
Duncan, lave the Haves much labour. Mr. Fitzmaurice 
has known it ; iifwer this end. Mr. Woodward and Mr. 
J. Woodward farther confirm the fame : the former has 
reduced its utility on his own eftate to the following 
rule : one plough^ two men^ and four horfes^ do as much 
work as thirty ne<rroes^ and, afte^- the plough, it does not 
require, fays he, much negro labour to prepare the 
ground for the cane. He thinks that the largeli part of 
the cane and ginger land in Barbadoes, may be ploughed

Whatihefe 2. Ill the earthing of canes, let the Eaft Indian 
Regulations fl^Qvel be iiitroduced, in the place of the hoe, where it 
is practicable. 

When the cane is ready to earth up, fays Mr. Botham, 
the fpace between the rows is ploughed deep, the cane 
tops tied up, and an inftrument like a broad fhovel, 
with teeth at the bottom, a fpade handle, and two cords 
fixed to the body of the fliovel, ending by a wooden 
handle 'for a purchafe, is ufed by tv/o perfons to earth 
up the cane, the ftrongeft holding the handle of the 
Ihovel, and prefTing it into the ploughed earth, while the 
other on the oppofite fide of the plant, by a jerk of the 
cord, draws up to the plant all the earth that the plough 
had loofened. Two perfons^ fays Mr. Botham, and he has 
been in the Weft as well as in the Eaft Indies, with this 
inftrument will earth up more canes in a day than ten ne^ 
groes with their /^^^^ according to the W. Indian method, 

3. Let the commiffions or premiums paid in fome- 
iilands on the crops, be taken from the attorneys and 
overfeers of eftates, and let falaries or an augmentation 
of falary be fubftituted in their ftead ; or, let the premiums 
and commiffions continue, but be paid fo much per head 
for the increafe of the flaves. 

It is the common practice for attorneys, and often 
for overfeers to have a commiflion on the crops (Cook, 
Davifon, Fitzmaurice, Clappefon, and Coor). This has 
a manifeft tendency to make them pufh the negroes be- 
yond their ftrength. Accordingly we find, from Davi- 
• fon, that he has been with attorneys to vifit the eftates, 

and he has itzii them do little elfe than inquire about the 
crop» He never heard them make any inquiries into the 
treatment or ft ate oftheftaves. Coor fays, he has known 
attornies wink at overfeers * preffing the flaves to perform 
more work than human nature could bear. 

* There is alfo a very deftrucftive notion prevalent, viz. " That he 18 
the beil overfeer who makes the largell crops." To this criterion of an 
overfeer's merit it is owing that thoufands of flaves have been killed by 
being overworked. This notion ought to be changed for the following : 
*' That he is the bell overfeer whopi^ferves the flaves." 

4. Let 



( 137 ) 

A. Let the pickino; of 2;rafs neither be extra work, ^f^^^ 'M' 
nor done in the intervals of reft ; but let a grais-gang ^^.^^ 
be felected for this purpof^ 5 or intirely abohih grais- 
picking, by laying out pafture land. 

This regulation, as may be feen in Chap. IV, Vt^ould 
tend wonderfully to leffen the labour and punifhmentj 
and, of courfe, promote the increafe ot the Ikves. 

5. Let the corn given to the negroes be ground for 
them. 

This regulation would tend much to leiTen their la- 
bour, as will be feen from the following account. When 
the women return home.^ fays Davies, they have to grind 
their corn, by xhtftrength of their arms rubbing it between 
two ftones. They muft rife with the earlierb dawn to 
prepare their food, that they may be in the field in time, 
to efcape punifhment. Their circumftances, but particu- 
larly the grinding of their corn, tended to difcourage mar- 
riage, the v> Oman's life becoming harder then from being 
thus a fla\'e to her hufband. Forlter alfo cblerves, thjc 
the grinding of their corn at night, by bane, was in 
crop- time a great hardiliip. 

6. Let tafks of fuch parts of the v/ork, as will acrr.it 
them, be afiigned to the ilaves as pracliled in America. 

In Am^crica, fays Baillie, the overfeer roufcd the 
flaves, and fet them to work in the morning. They did 
not work for fet hours, but by tafk work, gen-vrally a 
rood of land to each, when eafily cultivated ; when other- 
wife, the overfeer fets the ilrongeft to the hardeft work, 
and vice verfa : and indeed it was ufual to leiicn the 
piece of land confiderably, when uncommonly foul. 
The negroes generally helped thofe v/ho could not hnilh 
as. foon as the reft, fo that tJicy left xhz field at once^ 
pretty early in the afternoon, when their work ceafed, 
and they were at perfed't liberty lor the reft oi the day* 
Mr. Baillie addc, that the drivers feldoni or \m:\-zv whip- 
pL'd the flaves through their day's work ^ bccg.aic it v/as 
S impofTible 



( 138 ) 

pP7:au^xfc impOiTible to know till towards the clofe of the 6a.y^ 
Rcgulatkm whether a flave would or would not finiih his tafk, and 
*'^* it was thought time enough topunilh when the negroes 

deferved it. 

This politick method of working by tafk has been 
tried in Jamaica. Mr. Fitzmaurice hired fixty negroes, 
all Americans, from a Mr. Douglas who refided there, 
and employed them in this manner. They had a tafk 
meafured out to them every morning by Mr. Douglas or 
his overfeer, and which they finifhed by one or two 
o'clock, and had the reft of the day to themfelves. The 
driver carried no whip, and only went occafionally to fee 
that the work was properly done. 

It will now be evident to the reader how much the 
introduction of tafk-work into the Weft Indies would 
add to the eafe and comfort, and of courfe to the na- 
tural increafe, of the flaves ; for, by this wife and poli- 
tick method, the work is apportioned to the Jirength of the 
fMves^ and the weak are not obliged to keep up with the 
ftrong. The whip alfo, by v/hich they are inceffantly 
haraiTed, is avoided. This alone is of great importance, 
Mr, Crew thinks the ufe of the whip formed a difference 
in the treatment of American and Weft Indian faves great- 
ly to the difadvaniage of the latter. They have alfo, by 
means of the fyftem recommended, the important ad- 
vantage oi 2. part of the afternoon and evening to them^ 
felvcs^ in which they can cultivate their little portions 
of lands, prepare their provifions, and yet have fufEcient 
time to reft : all which would greatly add to the com- 
fort of their lives. 

If there fhould be any obje6lion to the fntrodudlion 
of tafk-work into the Weft India iflands, after what has 
been laid, it can only arife from a fuppofition, that the 
ilaves getting their work done by two or three in the af- 
ternoon, cannot do fo much for their owner, as thofe 
who work till fun-fet, on the prefent fyftem. The very 
reverfe, hov/ever, is the cafe : for Mr. Fitzmaurice ob- 
ferves, that thofe negroes whom he employed by tafk in 

Jamaica^ 



( 139 ) 

Jamaica, finifhed their work by one or two o'clock, ^^^^'^^:# 
whereas the plar^tation negroes on the adjoining land ^^^^" '*^'*'" 
would not finiiii till dark^ even with the driver^ the Jame 
quantity of land » 

Having now ftated all that appears in the evidence, 
on the fubje£^ of eafing the labour of the flaves, as the 
means of increafing them by birth, v/e come to a few 
regulations of another kind. 

7. Never let the fame perfon hold the offices of at- 
torney and overfeer, or manager : nor let an eftate be 
put under the care of an attorney v/ho either has many 
eftates to attend to, or who lives many miles from the 
eftate he is to fuperintend. 

All thefe evils are abundantly ftated in the evidence, 
and, it is therefore clear, that the above regulation would 
have a tendency to obtain prote£l:ion for the flaves, In 
cafes of unmerited or exceilive puniihment, on the part, 
of the overfeer ; for, by the 3d regulation, it would be 
the intereft of the attorney to inquire into their com- 
plaints, and redrefs them, and not, as at prefent, to 
wink at their oppreffion ; and by this regulation, he 
would be at hand and have time to do his duty. The 
flaves alfo would not be precluded by diftance, from pre 
ferring their own complaints. This fuperintendance of 
punifhments, was one of the caules that contributed to 
the increafe on an eftate mentioned in the preceding 
chapter, 

8. Let a fmall part of the cane-lands be difmantled 
and turned into provifion grounds, for the flaves. 

The great want of provifions, which the flaves experi- 
ence, has been amply explained in Chap. IV. It has 
been proved th?.t thofe who have land enough allowed 
them have notfufficient time to cultivate it; but that evil 
will be removed by the introduction of tafk-v/ork 
(Regul. 6.) and thofe who have little or no land will 
poflTefs it by the prefent. This would be particularly

mmthcfe ufcfiil, becaufe provifions ra'fed^ fays Botbam, feed ne» 
Kc^i'jauoiis ^^^^^ better than any dry or other provi/fons importah 
It w(iulcl aifo preferve them from falling off as they do at 
preient. Epldemicks, fays Coor, are more fatal to poor 
and ill ^tdi-, than to well ^26^ hearty flavcs. But one 
fa^al epidcmick prevailed while he was in Jamaica. It 
attacked all ranks of whiles and blacks, and generally 
poor, ill-fed negroes died of it. Few well-fed negroes 
died. of it, and not one zvhite man. Nor need the planters 
be afraid that the difmantling of the canes for provifion- 
land, will rob them of their former profits. If a hun- 
dred negroes cult'vate as many acres of cane^, and fifty 
acres be" deducted for their fupport, it is not improbable 
but that the fifty in canes, with the labour of a hundred 
perfon<^, may produce as much as the hundred acres be- 
fore 5 for a hundred labourers are better able to cultivate 
and improve fiity, than twice the number of acres, and 
the earth v/ill remunerate in proportion to the toil and 
improvement bellowed upon it. Of this we may ad- 
duce a ftriking inftance, from Fitzmaurice, He ob- 
ferves that a gentleman had two efSiates in Clarendon, 
one of which Mr. Fitzmaurice managed. This gentle- 
man had too few negroes for both elbtes, but fufficient 
for one. He, however, cultivated both. They pro- 
duced him together 150 hogfheads of fugar per annum. 
He became in debt, and his negroes fuffered. At 
length, changing his plan, he difmantled one of his 
eftates, and put both the gangs on the other. Thefe 
were then am.ply fulEcient, and he is now making 400 
hhds. that is 250 tnore hhds. per year upon this one cjlate^ 
than upon both together before^ and is now a clear man. 
This regulation then would tend to the proprietor's be». 
jieiit, as well as to the increafe of the flaves. 

9, I-et every encouragement be given to the moral 
and religious inllrudion of the flaves. 

A deficiency in this particular, appears throughout 

the whole of the evidence. There has been, however, 

■ here and there, a folitary inflance of a contrary nature, 

\u the knowledge of Coor, Forfter, Captain Smith, 

Duncan, 



( I4T ) 

Duncan, and Fltzmaurice ; and thefe declare, that ^'^'^^/^^/^ 
where fuch moral and religious inftru6tion have been ^rf"'^''" 
encouraged, the flaves have iliewn a better difpofition and 
behaviour ; that they have alfo paid a more general at- 
tention to marriage^ and that they have increajed more by 
the births. 

Having i\ov7 mentioned the principal regulations 
which the evidence fuggefts, in addition to thofe recom- 
mended in the former chapter, for producing a natural 
ijicreafe of the flaves, it is plain that were al] thofe re- 
gulations combined, and generally enforced in the co- 
ioniesj that increafe would be proportionably accelerated.

Words^ while the Generation immediately fucceeding thefe

By weans ^ i'^HIS queftlon may be anfwered from what has ap- 
of ibe J_ peared in fome of the preceding chapters. 

Jorcgoln^^ 

iheJVatll- Slaves have been (hewn to have been wounded by 

inenz^ DW- the v/atchmen, in dealing provifions to which they have 

•vers might [jge^ impelled by hunger ; but as, by fome of the fore- 

bo°ZrstntheZ^'^^Z regulations, they would be fuiEciently fed, (and 

field, where they have been fufEciently fed the evidence has 

fhewn that they have not ftolen at all) thofe watchmen 

would become unneceflary as fuch, and might be turned 

into the efFedtive field-gangs, 

It has appeared alfo, that where tafk-work is intro- 
duced the whip is unneceflary : hence the drivers, whofe 
only bufmefs is to force labour (and of whom there are 
four or five, fays Coor, to every lOO fiaves) might them-a 
felves be converted into field-iabourers. 

It 



( 143 ) 

It has been fhewn too, that, in coufequence of their be- Deereafe of 
ing better fed, according to feme of the regulations fug- ^^^^^" ^^^^ 
gefted, they would be far lefs liable to fuffer from epi- te retarded, 
derricks, and it is evident, that, being better fed, lefs 
worked and harraffed by the whip, that is, in every re- 
fpe£i:, better ufed, their lives w^ould be proportionably 
prolonged. 

It has likewife appeared, that two flaves, aflifted by Much of 
the plough, do the work of thirty without it ; and that, ^^"> ^^o"* 
in the ea^rthing up of the canes, two flaves ufing the^'^^^* 
Eaft Indian implement mentioned would do the work of 
ten with the hoe. 

From the prefent compulfive and oppreffive fyftem, it ^^^ ^^^ 
has appeared in evidence, that numbers of flaves run ^.^^"I'^J^^"" 
away, and are laid up fickly. But the regulations would efficient in 
put an end to thefe evils, and the gangs, not being defertedA^"^^'^ ^'^ 
and thinned as before, would become more efficient in ""'^^^''* 
ftrength and number. 

This ftrength and this number would be rendered ftill , 
more efFe(3:ive, by the affiftance andlabour of fuch, as we 
have feen, are under the prefent fyftem, often crippled or 
badly wounded by the watchmen. From the above 
then it appears, 

r. That on the day the importation fhould ceafe, the ^emecuM- 
colonifts, by incorporating the watchmen and drivers in '^nllTeZted' 
their field^gangs, v/ould have an additional number (and ed till the 
that a confiderable one) of feafoned hands by which they ''^^''^^^«^" 
would be compenfated for the natural deaths of the ^^^"'^^ ;;^;;f. 
working (laves, during at leaft: a part of the time in^/oy. 
which the rifmg generation were growing up for la- 
bour. 

2. That the natural deaths of the working flaves 
would be greatly and progreflively retarded, from that 
day, and could not poflibly happen fo frequently as 
before. 

^. That 



( 144 )

mratirm j-p ^{^^t it was on the day of flopping the importation, 
7» employ!' when the whole of the efficient hands under the former 
wretched fyllem were not thus called into employ. 

4. That even if no augmentation could be made to 
the number of working flaves, and their natural deaths 
were as frequent as before, it by no means follows that 
the cultivation need be impeded till the rifing generation 
could grow up ; becaufe a much lefs number of hands, 
afHfted by cattle and the implements mentioned, would 
evidently do much more work than a greater, under the 
prefent fyftem. 

In (hort, after the circumftances ftated, and confider- 
ing alio that there is now in the colonies a feries of 
Creoles of all ages, ready to fupply fijcceffively the places 
of many that would go off by natural death, no man 
can rationally fuppofe, that the number of working 
flaves could ever be reduced fo low, while the rifmg ge- 
neration were growing up, as not to be as fully adequate 
to the cultivation of the colonies, as they are at prefent. 
Mr. Botham fays, that by means of two-thirds, nay even 
one-half of the prefent force (and he fpeaks experimentally) 
the iflands might be much better cultivated) under certain 
regulations, than under what he terms, the prefent infer- 
able management : and yet the regulations fuggefted by 
Mr. Botham are not fo numerous as thofe deduced frorn 
the evidence, in the preceding .chapters. 

Many do- If, howcvcr, any one fhould difpute this point, he 
W^'^'^y^^muft be told, that the colonifts have yet many other 
Ij7ie!tjfa7y, r^fources. They have generally, in the iirft place, a 
number of domeftick ilaves that are fupernumerary 
and ufelefs. They have a great number of fupeiHuous 
domellicks at Barbadoes, fays Woodward, in town 
and country. Mr. Giles thinks half the domefticks 
of Grenada and Montferrat unneceiliiry. Lieutenant 

Davifon 



( HS ) 

tenant Davlfon has known, in Jamaica, from twelve to^Marjy do- 
twenty domefticks in a houfe, where half the number ^f;f^';j;2 
would have done as well. Dr. Jackfbn too obP^rves, thcit i/ ,uctj[!ayy, 
there are three times more domellicks in Jamaica than 
would be in England, for the fame work ; and Jeffreys, 
fpeaking of thofe in the fame ifland, fays they are too 
many ; they are a nuifance from their numbers. Hence 
it is clear, that were it poiTible a failure of hands for the 
field could take place before the afligned epocha ar- 
rived, many -domefticks might be fpared, without any 
inconvenience, for field-labour. Nor would this change 
be at all difagreeable to many of them : for we have 
feen their lives often rendered mlferable, by being con- 
flantly under the eye, and fubjet?!: to the caprice of their 
mafl:ers and miflreffes. Coor, indeed, has often heard 
many of them fay, that they v/ould rather be under the 
iield hardihips, than in the houfe. 

This refource, though very confiderable, is yet not ^Ifo Black 
the only one the planters are pofiefTed of : for manv of ^■f:/^^''-> 

in -li'l.^^ ' iv/jo!c place* 

the fiaves are coopers, carpenters, miii-wrights, copper- -y^^^,,-..

perform field-labour, and their places, if necelTary, be ^^^-'^^ ^•^^'?' 
fupplied by white men, who, if temperate^ would not 
fuffer in their health. Land furveying, fays Terry, 
is exceedingly laborious in the Weil Indies, and yet he 
followed it forfeven years, v/ithout injury to his health. 
He has often feen white mill-wrights at work in the 
fun, whofe health did not fuffer. There are alfo white 
coopers and blackfmiths there, but the former only di- 
rect negroes working under them. Lieutenant Davi- 
fon is fure whites, if temperate, could^ without material 
injury, do any kind of out-door work. It is well known 
that the fhip-wrights and other tradefmen in the king's 
yard, Port-Royal, often work all day long, and he never 
knew them unhealthier than people in general. White 
artificers do work at their trades in the Weft Indies, 
without materially hurting their health. Captain Cook 
has no doubt, and he fpeaks from many inftances, that 
white people by habits of temperance and regularity o£

art^cers^ much labour and fatigue in the Weft Indies, as any 

Hii^haefup- people whatever. Mr Clappefon thinks the whites, 

*>liedby if temperate, are able to labour in Jamaica. He fays, 

rVhlitMcn ^Q people work harder than the Englifti failors there : 

and Dr. Jackfon apprehends, as a medical man, that 

white men may work as artificers, in the Weft Indies^, 

without any qiateri^l detriment tp their health?

Whether there be not a prevaitlug opmion in the Colonies^ 
that it is cheaper to buy or import Slaves than thus to 
increafe them by P opulatioU'-^and whether the very re-- 
verfe of this opinion be not true; namely -^ that it is mors 
profitable to breed than to import* 



THAT fuch art opinion prevails ill the colonies is ^P'nm that 
too evident. Dalrymple, Captain Wilfon, Har- I'l^^Xn 
Fifon, and Sir George Young, all affirm, that in their ^,«f/, 
time it was thought by fome planters to be cheaper to buy 
than to breed. The prevalence of the fame notion is alfo 
confirmed by others. Mr. Rces was informed that the 
planters did not think it worth their v/hile to breed more 
than they did. The buying fyftem is faid by Dr. Jackfori 
to have been generally preferred. Captain Hall fays, the 
planters efteemed the charge of rearing a child to m.tu- 
rity, more troublefome and greater than buying a flavs 
£t for work, and the fame opinion is defcribed as pre- 
vailing by Fitzmaurice, Duncan, and Davifon. As a 
farther proof of the exiftence of fuch a notion, we may 
refer to the calculations made upon thefe occafions. If a 
negro lafted a certain time, fays Baillie. his death was 
accounted nothing* This time is defcribed by Fitz- 
maurice to be (zYQn years- Captain Giles alfo heard the 
term of kven years affixed for the exigence of a gang of 
negroes, which he faw, and we find a man of the name 
of Ycmman, by Captain Scott's account^ reducing his 
T 2 calculation 



( 148 ) 

calculation to four years, treating his flaves moft cruelly, 
and faying that four years labour of a negro was enough 
for him ; for that he then had his pennyworth out of him^ 
and he did not core what became of him afterwards* 

Iftherevcrfe ^g this notion Is fo fatal to population, and is indeed 

J^'^^^^^^y"'"^ evidently one grand fource from whence the prefent evils 

in the colonial fyftem fpring, it will be proper to examine 

the evidence, to fee if we cannot fhew the reverfe of it 

to be true. 

There is one circumllance that leads us llrongly to 

fufpe£l that it is not fo well founded as its general pre- 

anc'th'irdof valcnce fhould warrant, which is, that one^third of all 

^^:j]l^fl^l that are bought die in the feafoning. This feafoning is not 

]ea^mng, a diftempcr, but is the time an African takes to be fo 

habituated to the colonial labour, as to be counted aij 

eiFedtive fupply. 

Some Planters, fays Woolrich, who have bought lots 
of flaves, have informed him, that they have loft one- 
third of them or more in the firft year of their feafoning. 

Mr. Terry ftates, that very conliderable lolTes were 
common among the newly imported Africans. One- 
third die within the flrft year. Of a lot of fix, bought 
by himfelf, two died within the firft year, and at the 
^vi^ of Eve years two only furvived. 

Air. Forfter recolleits a planter, who bought thirty 
new negroes, and loft them all within the year, 

Mr. Fitzmaurice, in the laft four years he was in 
Jamaica, bougnt ninety-five new negroes. At the end 
of that time, he fold fifty- tvvo, all that were then alive, 
and thofe not feafoned. Ha 1 he kept them till feafoned, 
he fhould have loft more, and for this very reafon he fold 
them. He thinks, on an average, at leaft one-third of 
the new negroes imported, die ija the firft three years. 

Though 



C H9 ) 

Though this circumftance would induce us to think 
that it was cheaper to rear than to buy a flave, (for iri 
eftimating the price given for one that is bought, not only 
the prime coft is to be confidered, but a third more is to 
be added to it, with various other circumftances) yet, as 
fufficient data are not to be found in the evidence to 
enable us to come to a calculation, we mull be content 
to abide by the fa6ls that follow : 

Thofe eftates, fays Forfler, which bought the greateft ^urchafc of 
number of new negroes, were not thought to be the "/'^^-Z^!'^-^ 
moit Hourilhmg. it was exaaly the reverje. cndanaf/- 

TfU'Us and 

On an eftate, which Mr. Coor knew, the proprietor ^^^^^' 

was often buying lots of twenty^ thirty^ or forty jlaves^ and 
yet this man, by ill ufing them, [which ill ujage is infe-^ 
■parabiy conneSied with the buying fy/iem) fufFered a reduc- 
tion both in the number of his negroes and the produce 
of his eftate, fo that from good circumftances his credit 
was in eleven years reduced to a low ebb. 

Captain Scott was prefent at the f ale ofTemman's pro- 
ferty^ the perfon mentioned to have adopted the fyftem 
of buying in preference to that of breeding, and working 
his negroes up in the fpace of four years. 

Lieutenant Davifon believes owners of ilaves are very 
commonly involved with Guinea merchants; for they 
often ftay on the eftates all the week, except Sundays, 
with their gates always locked. 

The dependance on the imported flaves, fays the Rev. 
Mr. Davies, certainly contributed to e?nbarrajl planters. 

Mr. Wool rich, who is qualified to give the hiftory of 
Tortola in this particular, fays, that when he firft went 
there, there were but few (laves, and that at this time 
the planters were in good credit, and none of them in- 
volved in debt, in about three or four years, however, 
after his arrival there, fome Guinea fhlps came down 

witk 



( 150 ) 

purchase of With cargocs of flavcs. The planters in general boughf J 
many of the new negroes died in the feafoning, and 
Guinea (hpis coming down time after time, the planters; 
bought to fupply their places. This continuing, many 
of them got much into debt, by purchafmg flaves on 
credit, and were obliged to mortgage their eftates and 
flaves to merchants in England. He has never known 
a planter, who thus mortgaged, pay off the debt. Some 
in confequence have been obliged to have them fold by 
au(5i:ion, much under value, and he has known others, 
even obliged to become ove' Jeers where they were proprietors 
before. Since he left Tortola, he has been informed, by 
means of correfpondence, or feeing fome perfon from 
the ifland, (wh'ch is generally the cafe once a year) of 
its annual (late to the prefent time. The lail informa- 
tion reprefented the planters to be in very dillrelTed cir-' 
cumftances. Divers of their eflates, mortgaged in Eng- 
land, had been fold at publick vendue upon very low 
terms, becaufe few were able to pay for them, and the 
general credit fo low with the planters, that but fev/ 
could obtain the neceiTaries they wanted from the ftores 
kept there by reafon of their debts to the Englifh mer- 
chants. It has been his opinion for many years, that the 
-unneceffary purchafe of African Jlaves has been the main: 
caufe of their embarrajjments^ and the accumulation of 
their debts. He is fure that feven -eights of them would 
have been in much better circumjiahces^ if they had not 
bought any neg-^'oes during the time of his refidence there^ 
but had ujed thof they had with hunianiiy and care. 

To the above accounts we may ftabjoin the following; 
from Mr. Savage. In the year 1739, he obferves, a 
duty 'as laid in Carolina on the importation of flaves, 
v.'hich amounted to a prohibition, and which continued 
to 1744.. The purchafe of new negroes leaving involved 
the planters greatly in debt vjas the reajon why the Legifa^ 
tare laid it, 

Thefe are fome of the circumilances, which are in- 
tended to fhew, that the reverfe of the notion or opinion 

mentioned 



( 151 ) 

mentioned, is true, that is to fay, that it is cheaper to ?"--fM •/ 
breed than to import. Others are, that wherever eftates f °^^^'" 
are mentioned in the evidence as fiounthmg, and the mW^^ 
proprietors of them as clear men, it is where they have memseiui 
adopted the princip^ of breeding, and of treating the ^^^^'* 
flaves they have had with humanity and care.* It m^ay 
alfo be added here from the evidence, that the breeding 
of flaves was confidered fo profitable in fome parts of 
America, that people held them for this piirpofe ahne^ 
independently of any profpe6l from the fruits of their la- 
bour. 

* Many other advantages appear by the evidence to refult from the 
fyfteni of breeding Haves and uling them well. Suicide and rebellion are 
peculiar to the imported Haves. Hence the peace of mind and intereft ©f 
the proprietor are materially concerned, and it fully appears that fudt 
ilaves do much more work than others iu the fame time.

Trefimtpro- 1\ >f"^* IRVING ftatcs, by means of official papers 
dace of mjl JlVJ. ^^'^^ the Cuftom-houfe, that the Britiili Weft

^BrhJnand gi'cater quantity of fugar and rum than is requifite for 
herdepen- the coiifumption of Great Britain, her immediate depen- 
ioicku dencies, and che kingdom of Ireland, and, to extend the 

cu'tivation, he coniiders to be very impolitick, for two 

reafons : 



Extenjton of Firft, bccaufe fuch extenfion can only be made front 
it by-new Britiih Capitals, which might be employed in carryin^^ on 

(laves muR be , ,• i ? ri ^ J^ . j ° ♦ 

made out of ^""^ extendmg VrvQ manufactures, commerce, and agri- 
the capital o/'culture of the mother country ; but v/hich muft thus be 
the mother transferred to tlie.moft vulnerable parts of the empire, 
"''''^* and there inverted in purfuits, which do not appear to 
him to be produdlive of a profit to the proprietor, or of 
advantage to the public k, in any degree adequate to the 
precarious fituation in which fuch property ftands, frorn 
the contingencies of climate "and of war : for, if but one 
ifland fhould be loft, it is a complete lofs of fo much 
capital to the empire : and Mr. Irving ftiews their ex- 
tremely hazardous fituation, by the capture of fix of 
them, and the final feparation of Tobago in the late 
war. 

Secondly^ 



( 1S3 ) 

Secondly, becaufe the fugar and runi to be produced '^'^^ ^^ '"^^^ 
by extending the cultivation (the prefent cultivation be- J.^:^J';^^^' 
ing more than fufficient for the demand of England 2.nd' bnauks fror^ 
her dependencies) muft be exported to foreign ftates. This, Govemmcm, 
fays Mr. Irving, is exceedingly impolitick ; for the fugar 
made in the French iflands can be afforded (which he 
fhews by official papers) fo much cheaper than the 
Britiih, that, in order to enable the planters to fell it at 
the fame price as their rivals, Government muft give 
large and deflructive bounties. Mr. Irving even ftates, 
and this again officially, that, in the moil: favourable 
period for the Britifh iflands, viz. before the late war, 
the French planters were able to fell their fugars from 
tv/enty to thirty per cent, cheaper than the Britifh plan- 
ters : and he conceives it to be a maxim thoroughly 
eft^bliihed in national commerce, that it Is unwife to 
pufh forward by monopolies, reftri6i:ive regulations, or 
bounties, any branch of commerce or manufactures, 
which cannot be carried on, after a fair trial, within 
fifteen per cent, of the prices of other rival countries. 



entail 



To the above reafons, given by Mr. Irving, we may Mvjl 
add, that the extenfion of the cultivation, by means of ''^"f ^''^^'^^^ 
purchafmg new Haves, muft be exceedingly impolitick, pi,'-^;^^, 
if we bear in mind the evidence adduced in the preceding 
chapter : inafmuch as it muft be, as it ever has been, 
attended with debts, mortgages, and ruin. 

Now, if the above arguments fhould, in the opinion n'lereas if 
of the reader, fully prove the impolicy of the meafure oi^^adc by ^ 
carrying the cultivation beyond its prefent bounds ^y^^tZtu 
means of the prefent fyftem, it will be voiy eafy to evince he avoided, 
the policy of doing it by means of the rifmg generation 
of ilaves, and by them alone.* This will appear, firft, 
becaufe the breeding of flaves where it has been attended 
to as an obj-.-cf:, has been fhewn to increafe the proprie- 
tor's capital : for this reafon therefore, and from the 

* Sir George Young ftates his belief, that if the flave-tracle were 
abolifhed, and every proper regulation adopted, to encourage the breedh-g 
of negroes in the Well Indies, the ftock of negroes would gradually in- 
creafe, fo as to be adequate to the clearii.g and cultivation ot all the 
iflands, to the fuU extent of which they are capable. 

U circumftance 



( 154 ) 

circumftance of the flaves being in this cafe the growth 
of the eftates, and not, as by the former fyftem, pur- 
chafed, no capital ncea be drawr from the mother country^ 
to the hazard and detriment dcfc -bed. Secondly, becaufe 
thofe eftatef? mentioned in the evidence, upon which the 
breeding fyftem has been moft attended to, are almoft 
univerfally noticed, with t'lis remark, namely, that 
they had " got out of deht^^ or " were jiourijhing" or 
** were making mcney,^^ Now^ if eftates get out of 
debt, or flouriih, where the negroes are bred, while the 
reverfe is the cafe, where they are purchafed, it can only 
be becaufe the fyftem of cultivating by means of popula- 
tion muft be cheaper than in the other way : hence the 
Britifh planters would be enabled, zuithout any deflru£live 
bounties from Government to meet their rivals on an equal 
or perhaps a more favourable footing in foreign markets. 
It is evident alfo from the expreffions mentioned above to 
have been annexed to thofe eita^es where attention was 
paid to breeding, that the planters would cultivate, in 
this cafe, to their own certain emolument^ and not, as in 
the prefent fyftem to their ec^ually certain embarraflment 
and ruin, 

tpmhn on Having now mentioned the principal fa6ls contained 
poSo/^L ^^ ^^ evidence offered to Parliament by the petitioners 
flave.trade. of Great Britain, in behalf of the abolition of the flave 
trade, we cannot clofe this compilation better than in 
the words of Mr. Hercules Rofs : he fays, " finally as the 
*' refult of hi? obfervations and moft ferious reflection, he 
^' hefitates not to fay. that the trade for flaves ought to
