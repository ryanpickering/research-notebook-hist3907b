of the women of the United States may adopt the language of the Psalmist, and say, " The lines are fallen unto us in pleasant 
places, we have a goodly heritage," yet it becomes them to remember that there are others who are pining in bondage ; others 
who are bereft of all their rights as moral, intelligent, and responsible beings; and that for the redemption of these, as well as 
for the husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons of these captive ones, it is their duty and privilege to pray and to^abor, with a^ "^^ ^Nj

Sisters, we pause no»%ow to delineate the charaqtejyof American Slavery ; th« delineation is abundantly furnished in 
the publications of the Anti-Slavery Society, which we recommend to your solemn and prayerful perusal, as speaking forth the 
words of truth and soberness on this momentous subject ; neither is it our purpose to point out your duties to two and a half 
millions of our countrymen in chains, but simply to call your attention to the duty of petition. This duty branches out over 
all the civil and ecclesiastical organization of our country. Congress must be petitioned, every state Legislature must be 
petitioned, every national ecclesiastical body must be petitioned, every local church organization must be petitioned, and 
not petitioned once, or twice, or thrice, but without ceasing ; until the church and the state are both roused from the guilty 
indifference in which they now slumber, to the glorious work of righteous legislation, and unsparing rebuke of the master sin 

t ^---' WTOTgeupon you, wotioenM~Ani(erica7tlieduty of petiti^fing our national ana state Legislatures, because your voices- 1 J 

as citizens of this republic can be heard only through this medium. It is your solemn duty, as citizens of the United States, ' j ' 

to throw a saving influence into the councils of our nation. We urge upon you the duty of petitioning — because, as wives and N^ 

mothers, daughters and sisters, you can feel for the female slaves of the South, who are entirely unprotected by law in the ^^.^ 



\,^ 



sacred relation of marriage, and all the other relations of social life. The chords of sympathy in your hearts are wrought out 
of the finest materials ; let them, then, vibrate as every Southern breeze sweeps over them, the cries of the widows and orphans 
who have been made such by the inter-state slave trade — and the plaintive wail of the slave mothers — the Rachels of the South — 
whose lamentations, and w^ejepings, and pournings, are sent up taour ears, because their children.are not their own. 

We urge upon you, women of America, the duty of petitioning, because j/ou can work out the complete redemption of 
the slaves of the South. John Quincy Adams is known to have expressed the opinion, that if slavery was ever peaceably 
abolished in our country, women must do it. Politicians know full well, that when women petition, it is not because they are 
swayed by selfish considerations, commercial interest, or party spirit ; but because they are impelled by the loftier and more 
enduring motives of huinanity, justice, and love, which neither wax nor wane with the revolutioQs of state politics, or the shift- 
ing of trade winds, y^ /t^A^ £-<x-e<^ txtU-^ ~7,(r%.,u- •'i-i/W cl^^>.-^S'<-'«-J . iOi^cXi(c^^--*-^-t-»^

in the Halls of Congress, their voice has gone out into all our land, and aroused the vital energies of thousands who had been 
sleeping the sleep of death. To you, then, who have already set your hearts to the work of petitioning, we would Say, "go ^^ • 
forward ;" though the waves of a troubled sea may roll before you, and the Egyptian spirit of slavery may pursue you with ^X, 
imprecations and threats, " go forward ;" the watchword of God to Israel ought to be yoitr watchword, until the last chain falls 
from the limbs of the last slave upon earth. " Be not weary in well doing, for in due season ye shall reap, if ye faint not." 
'' Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them," and cease not to plead their cause, until you feel that, were you in 
their condition, you would say to the advocates of your rights, " it is enough; cease to pray for the redress of my wrongs, the 
restoration of my plundered rights." i/c^~— - {yXA-JLZxXT' ^J" J3V" j^^T^Ce-* — t, ^^^_^ ' .;^j.<,^vJi t^

silver and gold, your sympathy and prayers to the heathen of other lands, and care you not for those in our own country, who 
sit in the region and shadow of death at your own doors, and are made heathen by statute law? Sisters, think on these things, 
weigh well your responsibilities, and, in the fear of the Lord, resolve that the time past shall suffice to have looked on the 
wounded slave, fallen among thieves, and passed by on the other side in listless and criminal indifference, and that henceforth 
you will open your mouths for the dumb, and plead the cause of him who hath none to help him.

a common country, "suffer the word of exhortation." 
the deepest responsibilities — you are personally familiar with, and individually implicated in, the sin of slaveholding. You see from 
day to day the rights of humanity trampled in the dust. You know the mental darkness, and moral degradation, and corporeal 
suffering connected with slavery, and you have a power to do and to dare, to toil, and plead, and suffer for the cause of outraged 
humanity, which, as Northern women, we do not possess. You are in the midst of those who are covered with gross darkness 
who blasphemously claim the Bible as their charter for the collar and the chain, and glorious is the opportunity thus afforded 
you of laboring for the redemption of the captive, and enlightening, by the propagation of truth, the darkened understandings of 
slaveholders. We call upon you to exercise the right of petition to your state Legislatures, to Congress, and to the religious 
bodies with which you are connected as members of different sects. If you have not the moral courage to circulate a petition 
for signatures, at least sign one as individuals, and let these be sent up on ycur own responsibility, A single petition from 
Southern women, would shake the nation. Many such petitions might be sent to Congress through Northern Representatives, 
or Senators ; and many such might be sent, too, to the national ecclesiastical bodies, through the hands of Northern members 
of those assemblies, conventions, or conferences, and would not only clear your own skirts of the sin of slavery, but would be 
the means of strengthening the hands and encouraging the hearts of Northern abolitionists, who are now bearino- the burden and 
heat of the day. 

• ^ Let every woman who has before her eyes the fear of God, and in her heart the love of man, see to it that these petitions 
{ are thoroughly circulated in every family, and presented to every woman within her reach. If she can find no one in her own 
^ city, village, township, or county, to help her, let her take hold of the work alone, in all patience of hope. If others will come to 
J her aid, then the labor can be distributed among them; but done it must be. Her skirts will not be clear if it is left undone, unless her 
(^, Lord and Master can say, as he did of her who washed his feet with tears, " she hath done what she could," Let every woman 
^■'N^who has a heart of flesh, but do what she can, and slavery is abolished and the nation saved. Dear sisters, will you do what 
, you can for prostrate truth, and trampled law and outraged justice, — for broken hearts, and woman's violated honor, for widow- 
hood and orphanage, and hearths made desolate and wet with blood, — for daily and nightly rendings of tenderest ties, — for the 
soul's famishment for the bread of life, when enough and to spare lies forbidden at its very door.

We submit to you the following plan of operations, which has been extensively adopted, and which, we believe, will 
greatly facilitate the work of petitioning: 

Let Congress be memorialized on the subject of slavery in the District of Columbia, and in the Territory of Florida, and 
on the inter-state slave trade, and against the admission of Texas into the Union. 

Let the state Legislatures be memorialized on all the legal disabilities of the people of color ; let them be urged to assert 
the constitutional power of Congress over slavery in the District, and in the Territories, and over the slave trade between the 
states; also, to protest against the admission of any new state into the Union, whose Constitution tolerates slavery, and against 
the annexation of Texas. 

The following forms of petitions will be sent into every county, and into every township, in each of the states, slave- 
holding and non-slaveholding, wherev.er the name and post office address of a single woman can be procured to circulate them.
