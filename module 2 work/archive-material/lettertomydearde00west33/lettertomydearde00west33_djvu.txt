Abolitionists of Massachusetts — 

Twenty thousand persons have sent memorials 
to the State Legislature, asking that body to pro- 
test, in the name of the people, against the uncon- 
stitutional and despotic resolution, adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the United States, 
on the 21st of December last. This is well, 
but well needs to be made better, even on this 
topic. Farther, a large proportion, full three 
fourths of these petitioners, it is believed, are 
immediate abolitionists. Upon this estimate, 
^Qn, fifteen thousand persons,'at least, should, 
before this, have sent in their petitions, asking 
the Legislature to declare (1) that Congress 
has Constitutional power to abolish slavery and 
the slave trade, in the District of Columbia and 
the Territories, and the slave trade between the 
States ; and (2) that this power should be im- 
mediately exercised. Again, there are, in this 
State, at least 200 Anti-Slavery Societies form- 
ed on the principles of immediate emancipation. 
At a moderate estimate, these will average 100 
members each. But few, very few of them are 
juvenile societies, and of the others, but a small 
portion of their members are minors. Besides 
these, there is a multitude of abolitionists in the 
State, who are not members of any society. 
So that, upon the most moderate calculation, 
there are, in this Slate, at least 20,000 adults, 
who are immediate abolitionists, and therefore, 
upon this estimate, instead of fifteen thousand 
petitioners to the State Legislature, on the 
above subjects, there ought to have been, before 
this, at least TWENTY-THOUSAND; — 
• and if there had been, who does not know that 
the Legislature would at once speak the voice 
of immediatism on each and all of the topics 
named ? But, alas ! what are the facts ? Wiry, 
that on the first topic, 20,000 have petitioned, 
and on the latter, only 6,400 ! Yes, humiliat- 
ing as is th e fact, of twenty thousand adult 
abolitionists in the State of Massachusetts, not 
seven thousand have yet even ASKED their 
legislature to do ivhat it can, for the overthrow 
of that system of ahominations, which is profess- 
edly the abhorrence of their souls !^ Friends of 
the slave, is this right ? — Is this abolitionism ? — • 
Is this ' remembering them that are in bonds, 
as bound with them V Are you to be content 
with this? God forbid. 

What then is to be done ? W^e send out 
this circular to tell you. Last year the legisla- 
ture passed the resolution, quoted in the memo- 
rial on the next page. In that resolution, the 
right of Congress to abolish slavery in the Dis- 
trict, is admitted; and also; that nothing but 
' the public good' should restrain its exercise. 
What we want this session is, that the legisla- 
ture shall take another step, and say that jus- 
tice, hum.anity, the honor of the nation, and 
' the public good,' so far from restraining, re- 
quire, not only tlie exercise, but the immediate 
exercise of this right, in the abolition of slavery 
and the slave trade both, in that District. To 
this end, we must make the District our focal 
point of action. Besides, with 20,000 petition- 
ers against the resolution of Dec. 21st, and only 
6,400 against slavery, &c. in the District, what 
is the influence on the committee of the legis- 
lature ? Obviously this — that while multitudes 
are ready to stand for the right of petition, the 
abolitionists are but a handful. With this state 
of things, then, and v.-ith a committee less favor- 
able to the prayer of the petitioners than that of 
last year, the prospect now is, that the legisla- 



ture will go but little, if it does at all, in ad- 
vance of last year. The position of our cause 
is, therefore, most critical. Hence this special 
circular. Let every person then, who receives 
it, attend forthwith to the following things : 

1. Call at once, a meeting of the oflicers or 
members of the Anti-Slavery Society in your 
place, or if there be no society, a meeting of sev- 
eral friends of the cause, read this circular to 
them, and adopt measures for the prompt and 
thorough circulation of the annexed memorial, 
in every school district in town. 

2. Let adults only sign the memorial. 

3. Let men and women sign separate memo- 
rials. 

4. When the circulation is completed, let the 
signatures of all the men in each town, be uni- 
ted in one memorial,-€(rrd the signatures of the 
women in another. 

5. Fold each memorial, and write on the 
back of it, in a plain hand, the name of the first 
petitioner, the number of petitioners, and the 
place — thus — ' Petition of A. B. and — others, 

of , for a legislative declaration, &c. 

that Congress has the right, and ought immedi- 
ately, to abolish slavery and the slave trade in 
the "District of Columbia.' 

6. Let the memorials be all circulated and 
se7it to the legislature, within THREE tveeJcs, 
at farthest, — from this time — sooner if possible. 
It is important the petitions come in before the 
committee make up their report, which will be 
in about this time. , 

7. It is no objection to persons signing this 
memorial, that they have signed the former one, 
as this differs somewhat from that, ami is limit- 
ed to the District. 

8. The Preamble to the Constitution of the 
United States says — ' We, the people of the 
U. States in order to establish justice,* * pro- 
mote the general welfare, and secure the bless- 
ing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do 
ordain and establish this constitution,' &c. The 
Declaration of American Independence, says — 
' That to secure these rights [those of ' life, liber- 
ty, and the pursuit of happiness '] governments 
are instituted among men, that whenever any 
form of government becomes destructive oitJiese 
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abol- 
ish it, and to institute new Government,' &c. 
The quotations in the memorial refer to these : 
and yet the legislators of Massachusetts gravely 
suppose that ' the public good,' or ' the general 
welfare ' forbids the ' establishment of justice ' 
and the giving of ' liberty,' by Congress, to one 
sixth of' the people ' living upon territory under 
its 'exclusive legislation'! Our legislators 
need light. Twenty thousand petitioners will 
give it. They will make itday-light again, and 
operate like magic on ' the public good ' ! 

Friends of the slave, the work is yours— will 
you do it ? Rather let me say, what abolition- 
ist is there that will not do it, and do it noiv ? 
Oh! friends ! how would the heart of the slave 
leap for joy, and that of his oppressor quake 
with fear, to see us, by our petitions, marching 
up to our legislative halls, in a solid phalanx of 
TWENTY'THOUSAND! Do your duty, one 
and all, and it can be done.
