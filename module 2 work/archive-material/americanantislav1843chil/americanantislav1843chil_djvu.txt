THE "NATIONAL ANTISLAVery STANDARD. 

Published weekly, at the office of the American Anti-Slavery Society, 143 
Nassau street, New-York, edited by L. M. Child, and D. L. Child. 

The Executive Committee commend this journal to the support of every 
friend of liberty and truth. While it is a constant and watchful advocate of 
the rights of the colored man, it furnishes a good proportion of miscellaneous 
literature, intelligence, foreign and domestic, and practical hints for house- 
keepers. In a word, it is intended to be a pleasing and useful family news- 
paper, as well as an earnest anti-slavery advocate. It is the organ of no sect 
in religion, and of no party in politics; but impartially rebukes all sects and 
parties, which exert a pro-slavery influence, while it cheerfully awards praise 
without preference to those who discharge the obligations of Christianity, in 
relation to this great curse of our land. It represents that class of abolition- 
ists who consider the formation of a distinct political abolition party unwise and 
injurious ; but it makes no war upon those who think differently. 

TERMS. — Two dollars a year in advance ; two dollars and fifty cents if 
not paid within six months. 

ID* Ten dollars in advance, will pay for SIX copies for one year, sent to 
one address. 

ID* TWENTY copies, or more, will be sent to one address, at one dollar 
and fifty cents each. 

ID* Subscribers can remit money without expense by observing the follow- 
ing rule of the Post Office Department: — "A Postmaster may enclose money 
in a letter to the publisher of a newspaper, to pay the subscription of a third 
person, and frank the letter, if written by himself." 

ID* All remittances, and letters relating to the pecuniary concerns of the 
paper, should be addressed to ISAAC T. HOPPER, 143 Nassau street. 
New- York. 

" Were I in the Legislature of New-York, I would present a bill for the 
abolition of slavery with great care ; and I would never cease to be a mem- 
ber. I believe God governs the world, and I believe it to be a maxim in His 
as in our court, that those who ask for equity ought to do it." — Letter from 
John Jay. 

" The institution of slavery supersedes the necessity of an order of 
nobility. It will be fortunate for the non-slaveholding States if they 
are not driven to a similar institution in less than a quarter of a cen- 
tury.*'— Annual M essage o f Gov. McD iiffi e, of South Carolina. _

CHRONOLOGY. — JANUARY. 

Jan. 1817, a meeting of more than 3000 free colored citizens assem- 
bled at Philadelphia to express their distrust and abhorrence of the 
Colonization scheme. The venerable James Forten presided. 

The New-England Anti-Slavery Society, formed at Boston, Jan. 30th, 
1832. It was the first formed in the United States, and originally con- 
sisted of twelve members; not fishermen, but "fishers of men." It is 
now called the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. 

Jan. 1841, the Supreme Court of the United States decided what is 
called the Mississippi Slave Case. Mississippi had passed a law 
against the further importation of slaves, and out of the violation of this 
law arose a law-suit, referred to the Supreme' Court. Judge McLean 
pronounced the memorable opinion that "Slaves being considered as 
merchandise in some States cannot divest them of the leading and con- 
trolling quality of persons" According to this decision, Congress 
has no power to regulate the internal slave trade ; for that power 
could be derived only from the clause of the Constitution which em- 
powers it to "regulate commerce." 

Jan. 1841, Supreme Court of United States decided that the Africans 
taken in the Amistad were free. 

Jan. 13th, 1842, the first Slaveholder's Convention met at Annapolis. 
Maryland. Their object was to induce the Legislature to pass laws 
to prevent manumission, and to increase the oppressive weight already 
resting on .he free colored people ; and thus if possible to drive them 
off, with the aid of Colonization, The resolutions adopted were tyran- 
ical and barbarous in the extreme. They excited so much indignation 
in benevolent and religious-minded citizens, that several memorials were 
sent to the legislature remonstrating against the passage of such des- 
potic laws; and they were not passed. At this Convention Rev. 
Charles T. Torrey was arrested and thrown into prison for the crime 
of being present as a reporter. 

Jan. 24th, 1842, Hon. J. Q. Adams presented a petition, signed by forty 
citizens of Haverhill, Mass. praying Congress " peaceably to dissolve the 
Union." He moved that it might be referred to a commiutee, with instruc- 
tions to report against the prayer. Nevertheless, the wrath of southern 
members was so intense against him, that they demanded he should be visited 
with the severest censure of the House. After several days of fierce uproar, 
the whole subject was laid on the table. This petition, so offensive, coming 
from the North, was a literal copy of a petition from the South, during the 
days of nullification. 

Jan. 30th, 1842, at the anniversary of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery So- 
ciety, was read in Faneuil Hall, Boston, the Irish Address, signed by 60,000, 
among whom were Daniel O'Connell, Father Mat.hew, and Dr. Madden. It 
was an exhortation from the Irish to their countrymen in America, to co- 
operate with the abolitionists for the overthrow of slavery. It was received 
with great enthusiasm ; many Irishmen being present. Large meetings of 
Irishmen in various parts of the country, expressed great indignation at this 
proceeding, and pronounced the document a forgery ; to which opinion Bishop 
Hughes of New- York, gave his public sanction. It was, however a genuine 
document, sent spontaneously from Irish hearts. 

Masons and Dixon's Line. — This boundary takes its name from 
Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, appointed to run unfinished lines 
between Maryland and Pennsylvania, on the territories subject to the 
heirs of Lord Baltimore and "William Penn. The disputed question 
was settled by their survey in 1762.

James Madison thought it wrong to admit into the Constitution of the 
United States the iJea that there could be property in men. The Convention 
thought so likewise; therefore the original clause was altered, so as to re- 
cognize slaves as persons, not as property. 1* 



CHRONOLOGY. FEBRUARY. 

Feb. 20th, 1835, the brig Enterprise, which sailed from the District 
of Columbia to Charleston, S. C. with 78 slaves on hoard, put info 
Bermuda, in distress. At the request of the Friendly Society of coU 
ored people, the slaves were brought before the Chief Justice, and he 
pronounced them free, under the operation of British laws. They all 
remained there, except a woman with five children, who chose to re- 
turn to the United States; a proceeding for which her children may 
l^ereafter curse her memory. 

Feb. 13th, 1833, Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, brother of the last 
k*ing of Poland, died at Florence, aged 78. He rendered himself illtis* 
trious by being the first to emancipate his serfs throughout his 
extensive estates. 

SONNET. 

Addressed to Isaac T. Hopper, of New- York city, who, for more than half 
a century, has heen the active, uncompromising, and dauntless friend and 
advocate of the colored population of the United States, (both bond and free) 
-*-and through whose instrumentality, multitudes of wandering fugitives 
from the southern prison-house of bondage have been put in possession of 
the inestimable boon of liberty. 

Hipper! thou venerable friend of man, 

In heart and spirit young, though old in year?t, 
The tyrant trembles when thy name he hears, 

And the slave joys thy honest face to scan. 

A friend more true and brave, since time began, 
Humanity has never found: her fears 
By thee have been dispelled, and wiped the tears 

Adown her sorrow-stricken cheeks that ran. 

If like Napoleon's appears thy face,* 
Thy soul to his bears no similitude ; 

He came to curse, but thou to bless our race — 
Thy hands are white — in blood were his imbrued : 

His memory shall be covered with disgrace, 

But thine embalmed among the truly great and good. 

Wm. Lloyd Garrison. 



* The resemblance of this venerable philanthropist, in person and features, 
to Napoleon, is said, by Joseph Bonaparte, to be most remarkable,— beyond 
that of any other person whom he has seen in the old or new world. 



THE PRESS. 
How shall I speak thee, or thy power address, 
Thou god of our idolatry, the Press ? 
By thee, Religion, Liberty, and Laws, 
Exert their influence, and advance their cause; 
By thee, worse plagues than Pharaoh's land befell, 
Diffused, make earth the vestibule cf hell. 
Thou fountain, at which drink the good and wise; 
Thou ever-bubblina: spring of endless lies; 
JbiKe Eaen s uread, probationary tree. 
Knowledge of Good and Evil is from thee. Cowr-KR,

MARCH, 1843. 



31 davs. 



Was man ordained the slave of man to toil ? 
Yoked with the brutes and fettered to the soil ? 
Weighed in a tyrant's balance with his gold? 
NO ! Nature stamped us in a heavenly mould ; 
She bade no wretch his thankless labor urge, 
Nor trembling take the pittance and the scourge.

CHRONOLOGY. MARCH. 

March 2d, 1807, the Foreign slave trade prohibited by act of Con- 
press ; to take effect Jan. 1st, 1808. "The foreign slave trade, I 
mean, sir." 

March 1820, Missouri was admitted into the Union as a slaveholding 
State. AM the representatives from the Slave States voted for the 
admission, and 14 from the Free States. Any two of them might 
have prevented this extension of our great curse. 

March, 1841, Gov. Seward, of New-York, refused to deliver up to 
the Executive of Virginia, Peter Johnson, Edward Smith, and Isaac 
Gansey, charged with the crime of stealing a slave. The reason as- 
signed for refusal was that stealing a slave, within the jurisdiction, and 
against the laws of Virginia, is not a felony, or other crime, within the 
meaning of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution 
of the United States. A long official correspondence ensued, distin- 
guished on Gov. Seward's part by great courtesy and dignity, 
combined with firmness. 

March 1st, 1812, the Supreme Court of the United States decid- 
ed that the provisions in the Constitution of the United States, relative 
to fugitive slaves, executes itself so far as to authorise the owner or his 
agent to seize the fugitive in any State of the Union as property : — and 
that no State law is constitutional which interferes with such right. 

That Congress having legislated, such legislation is the supreme law 
of the land, excluding all State legislation upon the subject. 

This decision was drawn forth by a suit Maryland vs. Pennsylvania. 
A slave girl married a free man, and removed to Pennsylvania. A 
relative of her master, some years after, seized her and her children as 
slaves ; and though the latter were born in Pennsylvania, the Supreme 
Court decided that those who carried them off were not kidnappers. 
This decision has greatly emboldened slave-hunters, and increased the 
dangers of the colored population. 

March 21st, 1842, Joshua R. Giddings, of Ohio, submitted to Con- 
gress certain resolutions concerning the Creole. They purported that 
the Federal government had jurisdiction over all subjects of commerce 
and navigation on the high seas ; that when the Creole left the territo- 
rial jurisdiction of Virginia, the slave laws of that State ceased to have 
jurisdiction over those on board said brig; and that, in resuming their 
natural right to personal liberty, they had violated no law of the United 
States, to which alone they were amenable. 

This excited great uproar; and there was immediate demand that 
Mr. Giddings should be censured. At first, they showed no disposition 
to allow him a chance to defend himself; but growing cooler next day, 
it was graciously intimated that it might be allowed as a favor. But 
Mr. G. would either speak as a matter of right, or not at all. This 
not being accorded, he resigned his seat, and returned to Ohio. He 
was soon sent back, however, by an overwhelming majority. 

A Temperance Gem. — S. J. May, talking with a young man on the use 
of wine, thus stated the complete argument in a few emphatic words : " If 
it is a small sacrifice for you to give up drinking wine, do it for the sake 
of others ; if it is a great sacrifice, do it for your own sake." 



The world has heard the tocsin of truth and is awaking. Man is felt to 
be MAN— whether European prejudice frown upon him on account of his 
station, or American prejudice because of his color. — Charles Follen.

APRIL, 1843. 




They found them slares ! but who that title gave ? 
The God of Nature never formed a slave ! 
Though fraud or force acquire a master's name, 
Nalure and justice must remain the same — 
Nature imprints upon what e"er we see, 
That has a heart and life in it, BE TREE !

" I am very sensible of the honor you propose to me, of becoming a mem- 


ber of the society for the abolition of the slave trade. You know that no- 


jbody wishes more ardently to see an abolition, not only of the trade but of 


jtiie condition of slavery : and certainly nobody will be more willing to en- 


j counter every sacrifice for that object.-" — Thomas Jefferson. 



From the Journal of Commerce. 
WEST INDIA EMANCIPATION, 

Having recently arrived in this country from Jamaica, and purchased 
a farm in Ohio, with a view to r.pend the remainder of my days in this 
land, and finding the minds of the people so blinded as to the real state 
of slavery on the one hand, and the results of emancipation in the 
British Colonies on the other, I feel it to be a duty I owe to God and 
to the slave, to publish to the world my knowledge of the effects of 
slavery, and to bear testimony to the happy results of emancipation in 
the West Indies. As I have resided thirty-one years in Jamaica, and 
the Island of Old Providence, during which time I was a slaveholder, 
it may he supposed that I can give a pretty accurate statement of the 
horrors of slavery. I was considered by my neighbors in Jamaica as 
too indulgent to my slaves. They said I spoiled them — made them 
lazy — and that thus they were a bad example to the other slaves 
around me. Yet my treatment of them was harsh and arbitrary in 
the extreme. I would often flog men and women without mercy, and 
without sufficient cause. I thank Cod that he has awakened me to a 
sense of my guilt in treating my fellow men worse than the beasts of 
burden. I have seen enough of slavery to convince me that it is a 
system that every Christian should shudder at, and look upon as revolt- 
ing to humanity, and contrary tothe blessed precepts of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, viz. " whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye 
even so to them." 

I can assert without the fear of contradiction, that emancipation in 
the Island of Jamaica has been a blessirig to ail classes of its inhabi- 
tants, and has had the effect of influencing the emancipated to be in- 
dustrious, orderly, and useful members of society. So far as my 
knowledge goes, this is the case in all the British Colonies. Having 
been a participator in the sin of holding my fellow men in cruel bon- 
dage, I rejoice and thank Cod that the blacks in Jamaica are now the 
happiest class of peasantry, I believe in the world. They are seizing 
with avidity the means which are employed to enlighten their minds 
and point them to the cross of Christ. Another pleasing feature in the 
character of this people is the desire they manifest to have their 
children educated; and I am happy in being able to affirm that their 
children are as docile as any class of white children I ever saw. They 
are making rapid improvement in their studies. I have no other 
motive in thus coming before the public, than to give a simple and 
unvarnished statement of facts which I feel it incumbent on me to 
publish. P. LIVINGSTON. 



Governor SEWARD'S answer to the demand of the Governor 
of Virginia. 
" I cannot believe that a being of human substance, form, and image 
— endowed with the faculties, propensities, and passions common to 
our race, and having the same ultimate destiny, can, by the force of 
any human constitution or laws, be converted into a chattel, or thing, 
in which another being, like himself, can have property ; depriving 
him of his free will, and of the power of cultivating his own mind, and 
pursuing his own happiness. I cannot believe that can be stolen, which 
is not, and cannot be, property.'''* 



Speak the True Word, Live the True Life. — One watch set right 
will do to try many by ; and on the other hand, one that goes wrong may be 
the means of misleading a whole neighborhood.

Slavery in Maryland was founded in a disgraceful traffic, to which Ens- 
land lent her fostering aid from motives of interest. But wherefore should 
we confine the edge of censure to our ancestors, or those from whom they were 
purchased ? Are we not equally guilty ? They strewed around the seeds 
of slavery — ice cherish and sustain the growth. They introduced the system| 
— we enlarge, invigorate, and confirm it. Its continuance is as shameful as 
its origin.'" — William Pinckney. 



CHRONOLOGY. MAY. 

May 26th, 183G, the United States House of Representatives passe-d' 
the following resolution, which still remains in force: 

Resolved, That all petitions, memorials, resolutions, and proposi- 
tions, relating in any way, or to any extent whatever to the subject of 
slavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the 
table, and no further action whatever shall be had thereon. 

May 14th, 1838, Pennsylvania Hall, in Philadelphia, was opened for 
free discussion of all subjects interesting to American citizens. On the 
the 17th of the same month it was burned by a mob, because aboli- 
tionists were allowed to hold a meeting there. 

May 1st, 1841, the Legislature of New- York repealed the law that 
allowed slaveholders to hold their slaves nine months, within the juris- 
diction of New- York. 

May 1st, 1842, the Inspection Laws of Virginia, went into operation. 
They were passed in retaliation of Gov. Seward's refusal to deliver 
up the citizens of New-York, who were accused of bringing away 
slaves. Under pretext of searching every vessel for hidden slaves, 
New- York captains are subjected to processes involving vexatious de- 
lays, while they are compelled to pay the officers who serve them. 
They have paid the expense without murmuring, but they immedi- 
ately rose in proportion on the price of freight; so that the expense, ia 
fact, falls on Virginia. 

^(^<^ErTGUESTS~ 

It is well known that very few colored people belong to the Society 
of Friends. Natural temperament, and the influences of their station 
in life, both tend to make them partial to more exciting forms of reli- 
gion ; and the Friends, being no more free from prejudice against color 
than other sects, offer no additional attraction to draw them into their 
meetings. On this point, our friend Isaac T. Hopper once bore, his 
testimony in a very characteristic manner. David Mapes and his wife, 

the only colored members of meeting, were a very worthy and 

respectable couple. They came, among other Friends, to share the 
hospitality of Isaac's house, at Yearly meeting. Some questions arose 
in the family whether or not the white Friends would be offended to eat 
with them. " Leave that to me," said Isaac. When the hour came, 
he announced it thus: "Friends, dinner is now ready. David and his 
wife will come with me ; and as I like that all should be accommoda- 
ted, those who object to dining with them, can wait till they have 
done." 

Several smiled, but none of the guests remained behind. 



Mr. Pierpont being asked for his autograph, at the Massachusetts Fair, 
hastily wrote with a pencil the following happy effusion : 

THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OP "THEMSELVES." 
Our Tobacco they plant, and our Cotton they pick ; 

And our Rice they can harvest and thrash ; 
They feed us in health, and they nurse us when sick ; 

And they earn — while we pocket — our cash. 
They lead us when young, and they help us when old; 

And their toil loads our tables and shelves ; 
But they're ".niggers;" and therefore, (the truth must be told,) 

They cannot take care of hemselves.

Wake ! children of the men who said, 






" All are horn free" ! Their spirits come 






Back to the places where they bled, 






In Freedom's holy martyrdom, 






And find you sleeping on their graves, 






And hugging there your chains — ye slaves !

" We have found that this evil has preyed upon the

Union ; and has been prejudicial to all the States in which it lias existed."—

James Munroe. 2 































CHRONOLOGY. — JUNE. 

'June, 1840, the first General Anti-Slavery Convention, sometimes 
called " The World's Convention," was held in London. Lucretia 
Mott, (a highly-gifted minister in the Society of Friends) and two or 
three other women, were appointed delegates from various parts of 
the United States. They were treated with much courtesy as indivi- 
duals, but not allowed to take their place as delegates; on the ground 
that custom did not authorize women to take part in deliberative as- 
semblies. A young girl of 18 was at the same time the supreme head 
of the British nation, and Commander of its armies, and navy. 

Of the many cunning contrivances to escape from slavery, we think 
the following is about the most shrewd we have heard yet. Two 
slaves in a certain county of Virginia, ran away with one of their mas- 
ter's horses. They started very early in the morning, in the following 
fashion. One of the slaves fastened a strong rope round the other's 
body, tied him to the saddle, and drove off. When met and ques- 
tioned, the rider answered, " That black rascal undertook to run 
away from massa. I've caught him, and am taking him home, quick 
step. I guess he won't be for running away again in a hurry, after 
mussa's had the cooking of him." This failed not to elicit warm appro- 
bation, accompanied with hospitable offers of refreshment for himself 
and his horse. 

When arrived at a convenient place, the slaves exchanged places; 
the rider submitting to the rope in his turn, while the other performed 
his part to admiration ; and, like him received assistance and praise 
for his honest zeal in his master's service. 

Thus they journeyed "in tye," till they reached Pennsylvania, when 
the rope was no longer necessary. Thence they passed over into 
Canada. 



A PARAPHRASE OF ISAIAH— Chapter LXI. Verses, 1, £ 

To . 

'Tis God himself, within me, that I feel — 
He prompts my lips his purpose to reveal ! 
I come — the Lord's annointed — here to speak, 
And preach his word — glad tidings to the meek; — 
To heal the broken-hearted captive's pain ; 
Forever to dissolve oppression's chain: — 
From prison to release the wretched thrall, 
While, from his limbs the galling fetters fall. 
Hark! hapless mourner! lend an anguish'd ear, 
Hark ! I proclaim the Lord's accepted year. 
The day of vengeance of our God unroll ; 
And herald comfort to the mourner's soul. 
See Luke iv. 17— 21. John Quincy Adams. 



T rejoice to hear the guilt of slavery charged upon England. Yes, 
heap it upon sinning, erring England ! So much the more need that 
Englishmen should strive to atone for the mischief she has done. As 
you have copied England in her sin, copy her in her repentance. — 
Ckorge Thompson.

Three millions of her people lie,

CHRONOLOG IT . JULY. 

July 11th, 1767, John Quincy Adams was born. 

July 20th, 1835, a great meeting of southerners was held in Tam- 
many Hall, New-York, to put down the abolitionists. Nobody mobbed 
them for interfering with our peculiar institutions ; but they turned the 
Secretary' of the American Anti-Slavery Society out of doors, be- 
cause he was quietly taking notes. 

July 25th, 1835, Amos Dresser, a pious young man, travelling to 
distribute Bibles, was flogged 20 lashes on his bare back, in the pub- 
lic square of Nashville, Tenn. His crime was being the member of 
an anti-slavery society, and having a few anti-slavery publications in 
his trunk. Some pious church members assisted in the work. 

July 29th, 1835, the Mails of the United States were broken open by 
a mob, at Charleston, S. C. The anti-slavery documents were taken 
out, and burnt in the street, with the effigies of Arthur Tappan, W. L. 
Garrison, and Rev. Samuel Cox. 

July, 1842, three young men, by the name of Thompson, "Work, and 
Burr, attemp'ed to assist some slaves to escape. The slaves, perhaps 
thinking they were kidnappers, made known the place of assignation. 
They were seized and sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment in the 
State Prison of Missouri ; and there they now are at hard labor in their 
chains. Their motives were those of unmixed benevolence ; and it 
was admitted that they broke no law of Missouri, because there was 
none to meet the case. Two of them belonged to the Mission Insti- 
tute, in Illinois; the other was a mechanic of that State. Mr. Work 
is a native of Connecticut. They bear their severe afflictions with 
that heavenly resignation, which religion can alone inspire. 

July 1842, in Senate of the United'States, on motion of Messrs. Cal- 
houn and Preston, of South Carolina, colored men were forbidden to 
serve in the navy or army, except as cooks, stewards, servants, and 
musicians ; passed, 24 to 16. A rare instance of slaveholding coward- 
ice. Some of the bravest soldiers of the Revolution were colored; 
and colored soldiers distinguished themselves at New Orleans and Lake 
Champlain, in a manner that elicited the warmest praise. 



APPROPRIATE FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY. 

Who can with patience for a moment see 

The medley mass of pride and misery, 

Of whips and charters, manacles and rights,, 

Of slaving blacks, and democratic whites, 

And all the piebald policy that reigns 

In free confusion o'er Columbia's plains ? 

To think that man, thou just and righteous God.' 

Should stand before Thee, with a tyrant's rod, 

O'er creatures like himself — with souls from thee — 

And yet to boast of perfect liberty! 

Away ! away ! I'd rather hold my neck 

In doubtful tenure from a Sultan's beck, 

In climes where liberty has scarce been named, 

Nor any ri*ht, save that of ruling, claimed, — 

Than in this Land, where bastard freedom waves 

Her fustian flag in mock'ry over slaves. Thomas Moore. 



If the North would do its duty, every southern man would go 
back from his visits to the free States, humbled and thoughtful, a 
missionary in the cause of freedom. — Ellis Gray Loring.

CHRONOLOGY. — AUGUST. 

1st of August 1842, occurred the worst of several mobs against the 
colored people of Philadelphia. It was an entirely unprovoked attack 
upon a temperance procession of colored citizens, in commemmoration 
of British emancipation. A church and Hall, built with the hard 
earnings of colored ciiizens, was burnt down, their houses demolished 
or badly injured, and themselves beaten and mangled in the most fero- 
eious manner. The city authorities afforded no efficient protection till 
the mischief was all done, in a riot of two days. The National Intelli- 
gencer, the organ of Governm nt could draw no other moral from the 
bloody scene, than that "it would serve to teach the colored people the 
danger of having processions." 

22d of August, 1839, departed this life, Benjamin Lundy; one of the 
earliest, most active, and most disinterested friends of the American slave* 

August 1st, 1834, Great Britain emancipated 800,000 slaves in her 
West India Islands ; a glorious reward for the 800,000 women who sent 
a petition to Parliament almost too bulky to be carried in. Up to this 
time, not a single plantation has been fired, nor a single drop of blood 
shed by the emancipated slaves. The worst result is that large plant- 
ers have to pay more for labor, because their former servants are eager 
to settle on small farms of their own. 

August 10th, 1835, an academy established for children, without 
regard to complexion, in Canaan, N. H. was drawn off into the swamp, 
by a mob. 

August 11th, 1835, Dr. Reuben Crandell was thrown into prison, at 
Washington, D. C. for having an anti-slavery paper in his trunk. 

1st of August, abolitionists in various parts of Massachusetts held 
picnic parties, in commemoration of British Emancipation. 

"TmST"0F^UGU?Tr" 

Dr. Madden, then resident in Jamaica, thus wrote to Dr. Richardson, 
August 6th, 1834: 

" The first of August passed over without the slightest disorder. I did 
not see a drunken negro, nor any great appearance of exultation, except that 
which, in the subdued form of grateful piety, I witnessed in the churches. 

"In fact, for a great festival, it was as quiet a day as can well be imagin- 
ed. The only symptom I saw of turbulent joy, was on the part of some 
negro urchins, who were throwing stones at a drunken sailor, and who, 
when poor Jack made a reel after them, scampered away, shouting most 
lustily to each other, e What for you run away? We all free now ! Buckra 
can't catch we ? Hurra for fuss of Augus ! Hi, hi, fuss oi Augus ! Hurra 
for fuss of Augus !' 

Then the elite of the liberated blacks would courageously wheel round 
and give poor Jack another volley of pebbles, and cut all manner ol ridicu- 
lous capers before him. This was the only emanation of the great spirit that 
had just walked abroad, that I happened to get a glimpse of." 

If you could be in the British West Indies on the first of August, you 
would see throngs of happy sable faces, coming up from the fruitful vallies, 
and wandering in long procession over the sun-lit hills. Stop them in the 
loneliness of their forests, where the bright sunshine wakes and watches 
over the deep sleeping shadows of the bamboo and the cocoa, the cedar and 
the palm. Ask them' " What do you think of freedom now ?" The women 
will drop on. their knees, the men uncover their heads, and look reverently 
upward, as they answer, "Oh, massa, thank God, and the good English 
people ! Liberty so sweet !" — l. m. c.

Our fathers to their graves have gone; 




Their strife is past, their triumph won; 




But sterner trials wait the race 




Which rises in their honored place — 




A moral warfare with the crime 




And folly of an evil time. J. G. Whittier.

• CHRONOLOGY. SEPTEMBER. 

September 5th, 1841, a ferocious mob destroyed, for the third time, 
the printing press of the Philanthropist, an anti-slavery paper publish- 
ed in Cincinnati, Ohio. They tore down a house, where they suspected 
a runaway slave was concealed: were guilty of the most ferocious 
cruelty to colored men, and indecent brutality to colored women. They 
were supposed to be instigated by slaveholders in Kentucky. 

Sept. 15th, 1829, slavery abolished in Mexico, by a proclamation of 
the President. 

Sept. 5th, 1835, a large meeting in Clinton, Missouri, resolved that 
"abolitionists are worthy of immediate death, and that they w r ould re- 
ceive it in any part of that State." They also very highly recom- 
mended the Colonization Society. 

Sept. 17th, 1835, Grand Jury of Oneida county, N. Y. made a -pre- 
sentment, in which they say that those who form abolition societies 
are guilty of sedition and of right ought to be punished ; and that it is 
the duty of all citizens, friendly to the Constitution of the United 
States, to destroy all their publications wherever found. 

SLAVE A^ERTISEMENTST" 
The following was published by authority of Congress, in the Nation 
al Intelligencer. Northern men have a majority in Congress. " What 
has the North to do with slavery ?" 

" Notice. — Was committed to the jail of Washington County, Dis- 
trict of Columbia, as a runaway, a negro woman, by the name of Polly 
Leiper, and her infant child William. #--##* Says she was set 
free by John Campbell of Richmond, Va. in 1818 or 1819. The owner 
of the above-described woman and child, it any, are reqnested to come 
and prove them, and take them away ; or they will be sold for their 

JAIL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES, AS THE LAW DIRECTS. 

" May 19, 1827. Tench Ringgold, Marshall." 

"RUNAWAY NEGRO TAKEN.— on the first of November I took 
up a runaway, and,/o?* want of a jail, put him IN IRONS, and shall 
endeavor to keep him on my plantation, on the Mississippi river, five 
miles from Randolph. The negro says he belongs to Mr. Algon Smith, 
about 60 miles above Louisville, but he does not know the county or 
the nearest town, in consequence of never having lived with his mas- 
ter, — that about two years ago, Smith bought him in Maryland, since 
then he has been constantly hired out; that he has worked at Little 
Sandy Salt Works, that his name is Squire. He is full six feet high, 
well made, and is strong and active, but stoops a little forward as h« 
walks; is about 3'0 years old. He had on, when I took him, a strong 
cotton shirt, linsey (white) pantaloons, black tabby velvet vest, and 
blanket coat. He lost his hat and bundle in the cane while running 
from my dogs. He is a negro of good countenance; black, though not 
what would be considered very black: has two small scars on his face, 
one on his forehead, and one over the right eye, neither of which would 
be noticed unless closely examined. N. ROSS, "Randolph, Tipton co. 
Tennessee." — Louisville Journal, Ky. 

COMMITTED to the Jail of Tuscaloosa county, Ala. on the 21st o! 
August, 1840, a runaway Negro, who calls his name Hughey, and says 
he belongs to Patrick O'Neal, of Sumpter county. Hughey is about 
23 or 24 years old, 6 feet high, slender made, dark color, badly scarred 
on his thighs with the lash. The owner is requested to come forward, 

grove propertv, pay charges, and take him away, as the law directs, 
,. W. BARBER, Jailor. August 26, 1840.— Flag of the Union! Ala.

Let mammon hold, while mammon can, 








The bones and blood of living man ; 








Let tyrants scorn, while tyrants dare. 








The shrieks and writhing- of despair ;

Bonds, yokes and scourges have their date; 








Slavery itself must pass away, 








And be a tale of yesterday. J. Montgomery.

CHRONOLOGY. OCTOBER 

October 21st, 1835, mob at Utica, to break up a meeting to form a 
New-York State Anti-Slavery Society; headed by Samuel Beardsley, 
member of Congress. Bufore proceeding to business, the mob passed 
a resolution thai they were "respectable." 

October 21sr, 1835, a mob of 5000 " gentlemen of property and stand- 
ing,"' in Boston, mobbed the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, and 
dragged W. L. Garrison through the streets with a rope about his body. 

SLAVE ADVERTISEMNNTS. 

Congress passed a bill appropriating $17,000 for the maintainance of 
a Police Guard at Washington to protect the public buildings, and 
" enforce the regulations of die city." The people of the Free States, 
of course must must do their full share toward supporting these pub- 
lic buildings, and this Police Guard. The business of that police is 
seen in the following advertisement, -which appeared in the National 
Intelligencer of June 13. 

FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD— I will pay the above reward to 
any person or persons, who will inform me who he or she was 
who entered the enclosure of the lock-up house on Thirteenth street, 
(second ward,) and therefrom released and aided in the escape of 
a mulatto girl, aged 17 years, and a slave for life, named JANE 
STEWAitT, the same being placed by a police officer therein for safe 
keeping for the night. The person giving such information will be re- 
quired to assist in prosecuting and the obtaining and deliverv of said 
negro to me. JAMES MAGUIRE, 

June 17—31 11th street. 

A girl of seventeen years old placed in the watch-house, for being a 
slave for life — "for safe keeping for the night." Doubtless in the 
morning she was to have been carried off to some distant place. 

ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.— Ranaway from the sub- 
scriber on Tuesday, the 14th instant, a negro man slave named Levi, 
who call himself Levi Carroll, about 28 or 30 years of age, dark com- 
plexion, rather a pleasing countenance when in conversation, about 5 
feet 7 or 8 inches high. It is deemed useless to describe his dress, as 
he took a variety of clothing with him, He "left home without the 
slightest provocation, where he has a wife and child ; he has a mother 
living Avith a Mr. Brashears, within 5 or 6 miles of Vansville, Mary- 
land, where it is possible he may stop for a short time. 

I will give $25 if taken in this District, $50 if taken in Maryland, 
and the above reward of $100 iftakenin any other State, and secured so 
that I get him again, and all reasonable expenses paid if brought home. 
MARGARET A. CULVER, Washington City. 

June 20. National Intelligencer. 

Being compelled to toil without wages is not " the slightest provoca- 
tion" to run away ; is it ? We are happy to state that Levi is at a 
safe distance from the Washington slave-jails- In Albany, he told a 
friend, that his wife and children were free ; and he discovered that 
his mistress was going to sell him away from them. But then this 
was not •' the slightest provocation." 

For forty, out of forty-eight years, slavery has had a president from 
her own .territory. 

For thirty, out of thirty-six years, we have had a slaveholding 
Speaker in the House of Representatives, who has the appointment of 
all the Committees.

Ye Christian ministers of him 

Who came to make men free !

Then let your prayers ascend ,

That God is still his friend.

"That the dangerous consequences of this system of bondage have not as 
yet been felt, does not prove they never will be. To me, sir nothing, for 
which [ have not the evidence of my senses, is more clear than that it will 
one day destroy that reverence for liberty, which is the vital principle of a lie- 
public. " — William Pinckney. 



CHRONOLOGY. NOVEMBER. 

Nov. 1835, the Grand Jury of Tuscaloosa county, Alabama, indicted 
li. G. Williams, publishing agent of the Anti-Slavery Society, as "a 
wicked, malicious, seditious, and ill-disj.osed person," for publishing 
the following sentence in the Emancipator, "God commands and all 
nature cries out that man should not be held as property." Governor 
Gayle, of Alabama, demanded of Governor Marcy, of New- York that 
he should be given up under that indictment, to be tried by the laws 
of Alabama. Gov. Marcy respectfully declined the requisition, not 
being able to discover that the Constitution imposed upon him any 
such obligation. 

Nov. 7th, 1837, Rev. Mr. Lovejoy, editor of a paper favorable to 
anti-slavery, but of a very mild character, was murdered by a mob at 
Alton, Illinois. His press was dragged off and thrown into the river. 

Nov. 7th, 1841, the American brig Creole, bound from Richmond, 
Va. to New Orleans, with a cargo of 102 slaves, was seized by 19 of 
the slaves, and carried into Nassau, New Providence, one of the 
British West India islands. One passenger was killed, and the captain 
and a few others wounded. The whole affair was managed with a 
remarkable degree of bravery, discretion, and mercy. Every move- 
ment indicated an earnest desire to do as little mischief as possible, 
consistently with securing their own freedom. The ring-leader, a very 
large and strong -mulatto, was named Madison Washington. He had 
previously run away from bondage, and staid in the family of Hiram 
Wilson, in Canada. But he grew homesick for his wife, whom he left 
a slave in Virginia ; and he determined to rescue her at all hazards. 
He went back for this purpose, and was probably caught by his master, 
and sold to New Orleans as a punishment. At all events, he was 
next heard of as the hero of the Creole. It is believed that his be- 
loved wife was with him on board that vessel. The authorities of 
New Providence declared all the slaves free. Four -or five of the 
women (supposed to be mistresses of the white men) were at first in- 
clined to go back to the United States; but when the case had been 
truly represented to them by the colored people of the island, they 
took their freedom. 

Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, officially demanded of Great 
Britain redress of these grievances, in a style which slaveholders 
applauded to the echo. 

SLAVE ADVERTISEMENT. 

TEN DOLLARS REWARD.— Ranaway from the subscribers, on 
the loth of last month, the negro man Charles, about 4-5 years of age, 
5 feet 6 inches high ; red complexion ; has had the upper lid of his right 
eye torn, and a scar on his forehead ; speaks English only, and stut- 
ters when spoken to ; had on when he left, an iron collar, the prongs 
of which he broke off before absconding. The above reward will be 
paid for the arrest of said slave. W. E. & R. MURPHY, 132 Old Basin, 

We have accidentally lost the name of thesouthern newspaper, from 
which we cut the the above advertisement. It is a true bill, 
nevertheless. 

Anti-Slavery Zeal. — When Samuel J. May first began to feel inter- 
ested in the anti-slavery cause, Mr. Garrison's zeal naturally seemed to 
him excessive. Having one day listened to an outburst of indignation, he 
exclaimed, '" Why, brother Garrison, you are all on fire!" With eloquent 
solemnity, he replied, "Brother May, I have need to he all on fire ! — for 
there are mountains of ice around me to melt."

"It is a debt we owe to the purity of our religion, to show that it is at 
variance with that law which warrants slavery."— Patrick Henry. 

"I never mean, unless some particular circumstance should compel me to 
it, to possess another slave by purchase; it being among my first wishes to 
see some plan adopted by which slavery in this country may be abolished by 
\la uv' — General Washington. 



CHRONOLOGY. DECEMBER. 

Dec. 14th, 1799, Gen. Washington died. He manumitted all his 
slaves by will; giving as a reason for not doing it before, that they 
were so intermarried with his wife's slaves (whom he had no legal 
power to manumit) that it would occasion painful separations and heart- 
burnings. Thus he committed the great mistake of leaving them in 
old age, with helpless slave-habits, and without the protection and 
advice, which he might have given in his life time. 

Dec. 26th, 1831, Gov. Lumpkin, of Georgia, approved the act of the 
Legislature of Georgia, offering $5000 to any one who would arrest 
and bring to trial under the laws of that State, the editor or publisher 
of the Boston Liberator. The laws of Georgia would have awarded 
a cruel death ; but Massachusetts never took any notice of this inva- 
sion of the rights of a guiltless citizen. 

Dec. 7th, 1835, Andrew Jackson in his Message to Congress, accused 
the abolitionists of " unconstitutional and wicked attempts," and re- 
commended curtailment of the liberty of the press, in order to stop 
their interference with slavery. 

Dec. 16th 1835. Resolved, that the Legislature of South Carolina, 
having every confidence in the justice and friendship of the non-slave- 
holding States, announces her confident expectation, and she earnestly 
requests that the governments of these States will promptly and 
efficiently suppress all those associations within their respective limits 
purporting to be abolition societies. 

Dec. 4th, 1833, a Convention met at Adelphi Hall, Philadelphia, to 
form the American Anti-Slavery Society. Ten States were represented, 

FOREFATHER'S DAY.— December 22. 

BY M. W. CHAPMAN". 

The memory of the faithful dead 

Be on their children's hearts this day ! 
Your father's God, their host that led, 

Will shield you through the stormy way. 
Your Saviour bids you seek and save 

The trampled and the oppressed of earth j 
At his command the storm to brave, 

Faithful and true ! come boldly forth ! 
Their suffering though your souls must share- 
Though pride oppress and hate condem, 
Stand up ! and breathe your fearless prayer 

For those in bonds, as bound with them. 
Unheeded fall the fierce command 

That bids the struggling soul be dumb ! 
Shout with a voice to rouse a land ! 

Bid the free martyr spirit come ! 
Searcher of hearts, to thee we bow — 

Uphold us with- thy staff and rod ; 
Our fervent hearts are ready now — 

We come to do thy will, Oh God ! 



Free Thought. — It is written, " Many shall run to and fro, and 
knowledge shall be increased." Surely the plain rule is, let each considerate 
person have his way and see what it will lead to. For not this man and 
that man, hut all men, make up mankind, and their united tasks the task 
of all mankind. Wise man was he that counselled that speculation should 
have free course, and look fearlessly toward all the thirty-two points of 
the compass, whithersoever and howsoever it listed. — T. Carlyle.

Observe that engraving. It is a very expressive illustration of 
the effects of free labor and slave labor. Look at those two charac- 
ters (which may stand as likenesses of master and overseer) one 
pushing and the other flogging the animal, whose labor they wish 
to obtain ! What b the result of all their efforts ? Two idle men are 
wasting their time and energies ; for the creature will not stir one 
step. He has planted his fore foot out with the most indomitable

obstinacy, as if he had made up his mind to become a fixture in the 
soil ; while his hind-foot is lifted for a kick at his tormentors, if 
he can get a convenient chance. This is a positiop which cer- 
tainly does not indicate that he is a good Christian; but it proves 
that he is not so much of a Jackass, after all. 

Look at the other character, pursuing the opposite policy ; 
wiser, as well as more humane. He has no whip, cudgel or bridle. 
He simply holds a bunch of vegetables before the creature's nose ; 
and donkey as he is, he sets out after them full chase, allured by 
the smell of the eatables, and assured that he shall have the 
chewing of them at last. Hurrah ! merrily ride, thou sagacious 
traveller! Whole volumes of political economy, and huge treatises 
on education, and folios on the safety of emancipation, are writ- 
ten in that shrewd device of thine. Aye, wave thy hat in triumph, 
thou practical philosopher ! and shout to that cudgeller behind 
thee, that the northern donkey beats the southern, out and out, on 
the race course of productive labor ; and all because a bunch of 
beets are before his nose, instead of beats on his back ! Never 
fear giving offense to his republicanism by the assinine illustra- 
tion ! He is accustomed to consider all laborers as beasts of bur- 
den ; he buys them in the market, with oxen and cart-horses. 
Hurrah ! and let him who can stop thy speed, while that blessed 
bunch of provender goes before thee ! Will not southern states- 
men learn a lesson from this race between the North and the 
South ? 

FREE AND SLAVE LABOR. 

One mouth, and one back to two hands, is the law 

That the hand of his Maker has stamped upon man j 
But Slavery lays on God's image her paw, 

And fixes him out on a different plan ; 
Two mouths and two backs to two hand's she creates j 

And the consequence is, as she might have expected,. 
Let the hands do their best, upon all her estates, 

The mouths go half fed, and the backs half protected. 

J. Pierpowt. 

" If there be one who considers the institution of slavery harm- 
Jess, let him compare the condition of the slaveholding portion of 
this commonwealth, — barren, desolate, and seared as it were by 
the avenging hand of Heaven, — with the description which we 
have of this same country, from those who first broke its virgin 
soil. To what is this change ascribable? Alone to the withering 
and blasting effects of slavery. To that vice in the organization 
of society by which one half of its inhabitants are arrayed in in- 
terest and feeling against the other half; to that condition of 
things in which half a million of your population can feel no 
sympathy with society, in the prosperity of which they are forbid*

den to participate, and no attachment to a government at whose 
hands they receive nothing but injustice." — Speech of Mr. Faulk- 
ner, in the Legislature of Virginia, 1832. 

li Slavery is a mildew, which has blighted every region it has 
touched, from the creation of the world. Illustrations from 
the history of other countries, and other times, might be instruc- 
tive, but we have evidence nearer at hand, in the short histories 
of the different States of this great confederacy, which are im- 
pressive in their admonitions, and conclusive in their character." 
— Speech of Mr. Broadnax, in the Legislature of Virginia, 1832. 

" Sir, the evils of this system glare upon us at every step. 
When the owner looks at his wasted estate, he knows and feels 
them. When the statesman examines the condition of his coun- 
try, and finds her moral influence gone, her physical strength 
diminished, her political power waning, he sees and must confess 
them." — Speech of Mr. Summers in the Virginia Legislature, 1832. 

" The wide spreading ruin of this system is witnessed in our 
sparse population of freemen, our deserted habitations, and fields 
without culture. Strange to tell, even the wolf, driven back long 
since by the approach of man, now returns, after the lapse of a 
hundred years, and howls over the desolations of slavery." — Mr. 
Curtis of Virginia. 

" Slavery is an institution which presses heavily against the best 
interests of the State. It banishes free white labor ; it extermi- 
nates the mechanic, the artisan, the manufacturer. It deprives 
them of occupation ; it deprives them of bread. It converts the 
energy of a community into indolence, its power into imbecility, 
its efficiency into weakness." — Mr. Faulkner in the Virginia 
Legislature, 1832. 

"The most potent cause of the more rapid advancement of 
Cincinnati, than Louisville, is the absence of slavery. The same 
influences that made Ohio the young giant of the West, and is 
advancing Indiana to a grade higher than Kentucky, have opera- 
ted in the Queen City. They have no deadweight to carry; and 
consequently have the advantage of the race." — Louisville 
Gazette, Kentucky. 

" Labor is the product of mind, as much as of body ; and to 
secure that product, we must sway the mind by motives. Labor- 
ing against self-interest is what nobody ought to expect of white 
men ; much less of slaves. 

The slave system inflicts an incalculable amount of human

CAUSE OF HARD TIMES. 

Item 1st. Thirty Millions of dollars lost in the Florida war. 
Began, and carried on, to catch slaves. See Giddings' Speech in 
the House of Representatives, 1841. 

Item 2nd. At least Thirty Millions, northern capital, sunk bj 
United States Bank in southern debts and " cottton speculations." 
(A list has been published of southern extended debts belonging 
to the United States Bank, amounting to Twenty-seven Millions 
of dollars! 

Item 3d. Over Forty Millions lost to northern holders of south- 
ern stock, including stocks of the slave States, as well as those of 
Vicksburg and other banks, railroad and canal companies, &c. 

Item 4th. At least One Hundred Millions, southern debts, due 
northern merchants and manufacturers. (The citizens of the 
small town of Lynn, Mass. sustained a loss, mostly by southern 
trade, of Three Millions, being one thirty-third part of the whole 
sum we have put down ; and several houses in New- York city can 
show losses by southern debts, varying from Five Hundred Thou- 
sand to One Million of dollars.) 

Here then are causes of distress in Two Hundred Millions of 
Dollars lost to the country, compared with which all other alledg- 
ed causes are as " mole-hills to mountains." 

But some will ask, How is it that slaveholding is so destructive 
to all the pecuniary interests of the community where it exists ? 
I will answer, first, It cuts the sinews of action, takes away all 
motive to exertion in the laborer, so that he neither can nor will 
perform half the labor of a freeman. And again, by pouring 
contempt upon labor, the system begets an all-prevailing desire in 
the whole community to live a life of idleness. Secondly, slave- 
holding States pay enormously for that which the free States get 
for nothing. One hundred thousand laborers at one thousand 
dollars each, will cost, a slave State one hundred millions of dol- 
lars, and beside this the wife and children are to be paid for; while 
to the free State the laborer not only brings himself and family 
without cost, but brings also his household stuff and money in 
his pocket; and if it be true, as asserted in the newspapers, that 
the emigrants on board the ill-fated Erie, had with them one hun- 
dred and eighty thousand dollars, this last item should be allowed 
some weight in the account. — Emancipator. 

A Freeman's Answer. — The mayor of Albany, being asked to assist 
in recovering " a fugitive from injustice," replied, "In the discharge 
of my duties, I recognise no obligation to become a slave-catcher.''''

* Southern men have occupied the Presidential chair forty years and nine 
months; northern men, twelve years and one month. 

t "Within the last eight years, six appointments have been made to the 
bench of the Supreme Court — all from the slave States. 

X The present Attorney General, Mr. Legare, used the following language, 
in a debate had in Congress, on a petition praying for the recognition of the 
Republic of Haiti : 

"It ought to be rejected with reprobation. As sure as you live, sir, 
if this course is permitted to go on, the sun of this Union will go down 
— it will go down in blood — and go down to rise no more. I pro- 
nounce the authors of such things traitors, traitors not to their country 
only, but the whole human race." 

$ With the exception of J. W. Taylor, of New-York, who served thr.ee 
years, the North has not given a Speaker to the House since 1809.

THE WORLD IS WAKING! 
" And shall we scoff' at Europe's kings, 
When Freedom's fire is dim with us ? 
And round our country's altar clings 

The damning shade of slavery's curse ?" 

— J. G. Whittier. 

TUNIS. 

The Bey of Tunis has abolished the slave trade throughout his 
dominions; and set the example, by emancipating all his own slaves. 
Many of his courtiers are following his noble example. 

■ SPAIN. 

In Cuba a memorial has been presented to the government, from 
which we extract the following : 

" The greater part of this community are persuaded that we should 
greatly gain in safety, in civilization, and in our pecuniary interests, 
by the substitution of free labor for that of slaves ; and everything 
appears to be prepared for this reform.'''' 

RUSSIA. 

At the Anti-Slavery Convention in Paris, May, 1842, among many 
other distinguished foreigners, there was present M. de Tourguenoff, a 
former minister of the Emperor Alexander, who with his brother had 
come to concert a plan for the emancipation of the Russian seifs, and 
who has himself offered to emancipate three hundred peasants. 

The Emperor Nicholas is determined to abolish serfdom in Russia; 
during the past year he made a strong effort to effect it, but was de- 
feated, for the present, by the opposition of his nobles. 

BRAZIL. 

In 1835, Antonio Ferreira Franca, Deputy for Bahia, urged in the 
strongest manner, the emancipation of all slaves born in Brazil. Anto- 
nio Carlos de Andrada, the late premier, zealously used his influ- 
ence against slavery ; contending that it was impossible Brazil could 
prosper while one race oppressed the other, and stigmatizing slavery 
as the plague-spot of Brazil. 

Hollanda Cavalcanti, senator, and late Minister of Marine, always 
the declared enemy of slavery, has lately discharged all slaves from the 
arsenals of the empire ; and on his own plantation employs none but 
free laborers. 

Benefits have been given at theatres of Rio de Janeiro for the pur- 
pose of ransoming slaves. 

A variety of works against the slave trade and slavery, are sold pub- 
licly. J. J. Gurney's work on British emancipation has been transla- 
ted and circulated without hindrance. 

AUSTRIA. 

In 1826, the Austrian government issued a decree that every slave 
who should set foot on Austrian soil, or even on the deck of an Aus- 
trian vessel, should become free. New England has not this blessed 
privilege ; and cannot have, by reason of the "glorious Union." 



The Slave States have little more than half the white popula- 
tion that the Free States have ; yet they have more than tw«- 
thirds as many again ivhites who can neither read nor write ; whije 
the great mass of colored population is in midnight ignorance.

COLONIZATION ADDRESSING ITS BELOVED VICTIMS. 

Puss. Dearest rats and mice, I pray you go with me. Come and 
take hold of my paw, and let me lead you; feel of my paw, it is as 
soft as velvet. 

Dear brethren, you can never rise in this land, to the station your 
merits deserve. Men have a prejudice against you ; they compel you 
to feed on fragments, and live in dirty holes. Now if you will go with 
me, you shall have whole orchards of nuts and apples, and large rooms 
to live in ; and the shrewdest among you will soon get to be governors 
and judges. 

The old Rat. I say, smooth sir, will you please to tell me what you 
hold behind you ? It looks to me wonderfully like a dagger. As for 
your velvet paw, I have my suspicions that the claws are only drawn in. 

COLONIZATION ADDRESSING ITS ACCOMPLICES. 

Puss. Sir, believe me, I have not the slightest intention of injuring 
your property; on the contrary I would take such measures as would 
guarantee you its possession forever. You don't catch me talking 
with the inferior creatures that you've got shut up. You've paid your 
money for them, and you've a right to them. You've got them into a

tight trap, and very wisely put the Bible on it, as a precious weight to 
keep all safe and steady. But you see these free rats and mice, that 
are scampering round in such numbers, only serve to make the happy 
creatures in the trap discontented with their lot; I've caught them 
with their nose at the bars squeaking together; a practice which you 
must see is unsafe for your interests. The next thing, they will be 
pulling the Bible off, upsetting the trap, and gnawing a hole through 
the platform. Now r , just let me colonize them, and they will be nicely 
out of your way; and now and then for the sake of appearances, you 
can let one out of the trap, and bid him go with his comrades. 

Slaveholder. Ha ! ha ! ha ! a good plan, by Jove. But go to the 
yankees, and make them pay for shipping the nuisances. But harkee, 
don't call'em nuisances there; call'em misssionaries, They're going 
to convert Africa, you know. The Devil take'em !" 

Puss. Trust me. I have a velvet paw ; and nobody shall see what's 
folded up inside of it. 

" The object of the Society, if I understand it aright, involves no in- 
trusion on property, nor even upon prejudice." — Fifteenth Annual Re' 
port of the Colonization Society. 

At a meeting in Washington, to form the Colonization Society, Mr. 
Randolph said, "Being myself a slaveholder, I deem it necessary to 
show that the proposed Society will prove one of the greatest securi- 
ties to enable the master to keep in possession of his own properly." 

" Of all classes of our population the most vicious is the free color- 
ed." — Tenth Report of the Colonization Society. 

" Free blacks are a greater nuisance than the slaves themselves." — 
African Repository, organ of the Colonization Society." 

" They are a useless and pernicious, if not a dangerous portion of 
our population." — Henry Clay. 

"Each emigrant is a missionary, carrying with him credentials in 
the holy cause of civilization, religion, and free institutions." — The 
same Henry Clay. 

" Either moral or physical force must be used to compel these people 
to go." — A Virginia Legislator in the Debate of 1832. 

[Pussy's velvet paw is the moral force ; her claws and dagger are the 
physical, kept in reserve, if velvet won't answer.] 

By removing the most fruitful sources of discontent (free blacks) 
from among our slaves, we should render them more industrious, and 
attentive to our commands. — Address of Rutnam, (Geo.) Colonization 
Society. 

" When the war cry was heard, I caught my musket, and called Mr. 
Brown, and all the rest, out to fight. I fired the first musket and put 
fifty buck shot into Grotio. The people came hundreds of miles after- 
ward to see his head and eyes." — Address of Mr. Harris, a colored man 
from Liberia; one of Henry Clay's "missionaries of the Gospel." 

The American Colonization Society has been in existence 21 years. 
Prior to July 1st 1S42, it had expended nearly one million of dollars. 
In the course of 22 years, it has conveyed to Africa 3704 free blacks 
and emancipated slaves; and 300 recaptured Africans; total 3734, 
This averages 169 a year; a much smaller number than is added to 
the slave population every day,

BENJAMIN LAY. 

This singular being, as peculiar in person as he was remarkable in 
character, was the earliest advocate of anti-slavery on record. He was 
born in Colchester, England, 1677. In 1718, he removed to Barbadoes. 
The slave trade was then carried on with great activity in the West 
Indies, and the cruelties he witnessed soon moved his humane heart to 
pity and indignation. The boldness with which he testified against 
slaveholding soon excited popular clamor ; and after bearing it thirteen 
years, he concluded to seek an asylum in America. His excellent wife 
sympathised entirely in his views. She said she wished to leave Bar- 
badoes, " Lest by remabiing there she might be leavened into the nature 
of the inhabitants, which ivas pride and oppression." 

In Pennsylvania, he soon become known to every man, woman, and 
child, by the oddity of his appearance, and the singularity of his pro- 
ceedings. 

He was only four feet seven inches in height ; his head was large in 
proportion to his body ; the features of his face were remarkable, and 
boldly delineated, and his countenance was grave and benignant ; 
" bespeaking innocency and righteousness." He was hunchbacked, 
with a projecting chest, below which his body became much contracted. 
His legs were so slender, as to appear almost unequal to the purpose 
of supporting him, diminutive as his frame was, in comparison with 
the ordinary size of the human stature. He never shaved ; and his 
beard, which was milk-white, hung low upon his breast. His dress 
was always the same ; a white hat, and half-boots, tow coat and trow- 
sers, of his own spinning, of the natural color, often very much darned. 
.It is singular, that his wife very much resembled him in size, and had 
a crooked back. The similarity of their appearane even excited the 
remarks of the slaves in Barbadoes ; who used to say when they saw 



36 ANTI-SLAVERY ALMANAC. 

them together, " That title bachararar* man, go all over world, see for 
that backararar woman for himself." 

He always travelled on foot, oftentimes to a considerable distance. 
Having once walked to Philadelphia, with an intention of conversing 
with an individual of considerable note, he found the family at break- 
fast ; Lay was invited to partake vvith them; but seeing a black servant 
in attendance, he inquired of his master, " Is this man a slave?" 
" Yes," replied his host. " Then I will not share with thee the fruits of 
thy unrighteousness ;" said he; and immediately departed from the 
house. He never owned a slave himself, neither would he sit with 
nor partake of the food of any one who did. 

On one occasion he met a fine boy of six years old, whom he coaxed 
to go with him to his dwelling in the woods. Toward night, the ago- 
nized parents came to him, exclaiming, " Oh, Benjamin ! Our child has 
been missing all day." " Your child is safe in my house," szid he," and 
you may now conceive of the sorrow you inflict upon the parents of the 
negro girl you hold in slavery ; for she was torn from them by avarice. 13 

His parents belonged to the Society of Friends, and he was a con? 
stant attendant at the Monthly Meetings. At that time, many mem- 
bers of the society were slaveholders. Benjamin gave no peace to any 
one of that description. As sure as any such character attempted to 
speak to the business of the meeting, he would start to his feet, and 
cry out, " There's another negro-master !" 

In 1737, he published a book against slavery, which was printed by 
Benjamin Franklin, who always entertained the highest respect for 
this singular but most benevolent man. There was likewise a very 
eordial attachment between Benjamin Lay and Anthony Benezet. He 
died in 1759, at his residence near Philadelphia. For forty-one yearg 
he bore a zealous and persevering testimony against the sin of slavery

APPORTIONMENT OF REPRESENTATIVES. 

At the long session of Congress in 1842, 70,680 was adopted as the 
ratio of representation, after a good deal of resistance from the Flouse. 
An amendment to the bill provided an additional representative for 
such States as have a fraction over half the ratio. 

In the following tables, the first, column shows the number of repre- 
sentatives by the old apportionment.; the second, by the new ; the
