IT IS fome years fince I received the firft of 
thefe l.oittcrs from a friend: fince which I 
have been frequently folliciting him to confent 
to their being made publick, and have very late- 
ly by hisfecond letter prevailed with him. 

The Subject is fo intcrcfting to mankind in 
Genera!, that the candid reader I truft will cx- 
cufe any Apology for my offering them to his 
impartial confideration. It is very furprizing 
fays a late ingenious French Ajathor, " that the 
Greeks and Romans, with fo much knowledge 
and humanityhad fl'aves like the Barbarians, in- 
ftead o^ Domeftics ; it is ftilL niorcrfurprizing, 
perhaps, that chriflian nations with the Gofpel 
before their Eyes, fhould condemn their brethren 
in the colonies to all the horrors of flavery,be- 
caufe they are black. The firft man, who faid to 
^noihGT, joujhall be myjlave^ fori amjironger 
thany^u; mufthave had the heart of a Tygcr. 
But the firft man, who faid to another, I fee you 
are poor ^ if you will receive your fubftflance from 
me^youjloall be my domefiic^ madeacontra(it ufe-

CONSIDERATIONS, %. 



IUnderfland you have thoughts of being concern- 
ed in the African flave-trade. My regard to the 
welfare of all mankind, and particular affeflion 
for you, leads me at this time*to[ write you my 
fentiments upon ^avery, and the' jflave-trade.-^ 
And I doubt not but you will excufe my thus med- 
dling In your bufinefs, when you confider 1 have- no 
private ends toanfwer. If what I fhall offer upon the 
fubje(fi,jQiouId be thought of no weight, it will only in- 
terrupt you a few minutes ; but if I fhould be fo hap- 
py as to convince you,that however profitable the trade 
may be to fome adventurers, yet that it is contrary to 
humanity, chriftianity, the intereft of the province, ajitd 
of private families, I fhall not only be IJire of your dc- 
fiiting from fo vile a trade, but have great hopes, that 
your example and influence in this pUc^will, in time,, 
produce an a£i of government to prevent the further

impoj-tation of flavcs among us ; and I can flatter my- 
. fclf, that the example of this proyince may iBfluence 
others ; but if not, we can be glorioufly fingle. 

Great-Britain, the envy of the world, does not per- 
mit a flavc on her happy ifland ; but gives to every one 
freedom, which ftamps him image of his God. 

Before I enter upon the arguments for and againft 
the trade, permit me to contraft a Briton and a negro 
Jlavc in America, neither chargeable with any crime 

^ cognizable by the public-^^^ Briton has the free difpo- 
fal of his time, to employ it in that way he likes beft ; 
all he gains by his induftry, he hath fo\e right to; 
none of it can be taken from him, but by his confent ; 

CPL'he may marry, no man can fep^rate him from the ob- 
ject of his afTedlions ; his houfe is "his caftle ; none (un- 
Jefs he has made himfelf obnoxious to the public)may 
intrude upon him. JHappy Briton ! The flav" has 
neither command of his time, nor choice of his em- 
ploy ; mufl: labour inceflantly during his maftcr's 
pleafure ; can make no claim to the produce of his own 

J2^nduftry ; a bare fubfift^nce is all he receives ; and 
th^ne has labolrj^ 20 years, and carri^ his mafter 
an eftate, yet even then he is liable 'to be fold, and of- 
ten is, for want of employ, or for fear that in his old 
age hefliould be a burthen upon the wealthy heirs. He 
canjmarr^', becaufe marriage is founded on fromtfe, 
anaflaves can promife nothing. They are indeed, 
fometimes, to pleafe them, indulged a fliam-marriagc, 
which is didblved again at the mafter's will, without 
confuhing the flaves' inclination. He is fold out of 
the country, and fo fhifted from hand to hand (if be 
lives to be old)ytill he is a burthen, and wifhed out of 
]ife to fave expence. Shocking contraft I Whatever

Perhaps he wails his Wife, his children, l^fc
