Abolitionists of , Massachusetts — 




f/lA-e..-^:' . Twenty thousand persons have sent memorials 

'^ to the State Legislature, asking that body to pro- 

n^'^^.^tXX^ test, in the name of the people, against the uncon- 

o' ^ stitutional and despotic resolution, adopted by the 

tZZ^ /^ (^y^ House of Eepresentatives of the United States, 

'-^^ ^ on the 21st of December last. This is well, 

/y% ^^fe- ^""^ ^^^'^ r^Q^^^ to be made better, even on this 

(hO topic. Farther, a large proportion, full three 

2^0 Ay/- -Tm^-^ fourths of these petitioners, it is believed, are 

f^-^^L ^ -^ immediate abolitionists. Upon this estimate, 

a y x-r n nn. ^^^"^^ fifteen thousand persons, at least, should, 

l^r-<J^ A^^ ^ -before this, have sent in their petitions, asking 

\. ,. 'the Legislature to declare (1) that Congress 

/2^^i^/Tmi^/t^ „<&Clias Constitutional power to abolish slavery and 

/ the slave trade, in the District of Columbia and 

L^l n J^Z^T^' ^'^^ Territories, and the slave trade between the 

w (/c ^ r ' States ; and (2) that this power should be im- 

^ ^ mediately exercised. Again, there are, in this

c- 



l^iyPi^ State, at least 200 Anti-Slavery Societies form- 

ed on the principles of immediate emancipation. 



d/pZyt^ /t-<2-^Af a moderate estimate, these will average 100 

/ 7 members each. But few, very few of them are 

dJ- .'J _^ y>-rf;^2^™^^ societies, and of the others, but a small 

^^^^^ * t-^^-^^i^'ytSf^on of their members are minors. Besides 

• -x- ~\ /^^these, there is a muhitude of abolitionists in the 

^>wVfe>cx»^ t-'^^^SJ^te, who are not members of any society.

upon this estimate, instead of fifteen thousand

A-- JUt^ /I^Q^of ^^o,t system of alominations, which is pro0s 
J ''^ f^^^^ly the abhorrence of their souls! Friends of 
/h '^C^ -^^WT^ ^J'xs^Q, is this right ?— Is this abolitionism ?— 
C/l^ '^^J'-^ *^yls this ' remembering them 
C^ as bound with them ?' Are 

Aviththis? God forbid. Q 

W'hat then is to be done ? We send out 

^ 'this circular to tell you. , Last year the legisla- 

/TTjtji^ ti^i's passed the resolution, quoted in (he m'emo- 

i/ i^i^j^ :iial on the next page. In that resolution, the 

(J c^X^'^S^^ °f Congress to abolish slavery ih the Bis- 






that are in bonds, 
you to be content 






trict, is admitted ; and also, that nothing but 

the public good' should restrain its exercise. 

What we want this session is, that the legisla- 



/4^M /^t/T^'tc'"^'*^ '^'^^^ ^^''"'^ another step, and say that jus 
i^^JL. tice, hum.anity, the honor of the nation, and 

/n\J\. 0^ ^^j^he public good,' so far from restraining, re- 
Y" . quire, not only the exercise, but the imme'diate 

' OyY^ J r^xJ^yt^^"^'^^^^ °'^ this right, in the abolition of slavery 
r"^ t-^/r*^ and the slave trade both, in that District. To 
fl V ^o this end, we must make the District our focal 

i^xTL^i^ point of action. Besides, with 20,000 petition- 

. % ier>*^y *^^'^ against the resolution of Dec. 21st, and only 
_^ 6,400 against slavery, &c. in the District, what 
^^;^,^je_^is the influence on the committee of the leg-is- 



1 but little, if it does at all, in ad- 



*^^ 



AwtV*^^^ : *r ' . Jature? Obviously this— that while multitudes 

,i^^.f^{;;C 'h-'^S^ are ready to stand for the right of petition, the 

* ^^_^bolitionists are but a handful. JVith this state 

fy^ ^y C..<''^'*'cif things, then, and with a committee less favBr- 

O- / ayt^^^^'^'^ ^° ^^^'^ prayer of the petitioners than that of 
(Ix^r ^•^^'^'^-^last year, the prospect now is, that the legisla- ^u^wu 



ture will go 

yance of last year. The position of our cause 
is, therefore, most critical. Hence this special 
circular. Let every person then, who receives 
it, attend forthwith to the following things : 

1. Call at once, a meeting of tlie officers or 
members _ of the Anti-Slavery Society in your 
place, or if there be no society, a meeting of sev- 
eral friends of the cause, read this circular to 
them, and adopt measures for the prompt and 
thorough circulation of the annexed memorial, 
in every school district in town. 

2. Let adults only sign the memorial. 

_ 3. Let men and women sign separate memo- 
rials. 

_ 4. When the circulation is completed, let the 
signatures of all the men in each town, be uni- 
ted in one memorial, and the signatures of the 
women in another. 

5. Fold each memorial, and write on the 
back of it, in a plain hand, the name of the first 
petitioner, the number of petitioners, and the 
place — thus — ' Petition of A. B. and — others, 

of , for a legislative declaration, &c. 

that Congress has the right, and ought iramedi- 
ately,_to abolish slavery and the slave trade in 
the District of Columbia.' 

6. Let the memorials be all circulated and 
sent to the legislature, within THEEE iveehs, 
at farthest, — from this time — sooner if possible.' 
It is important the petitions come in before the 
committee make up their report, which will be 
in about this time. 

7. It is no objection to persons sifjninir this 
memorial, that they have signed the forme"i-one, 
as this difl^ers somewhat from that, and is limit- 
ed to the District. 

8. The Preamble to the Constitution of the 
United States says — ' We, the people of the 
U. Slates in order to establish justice, ^ * pro- 
mote the general welfare, and secure the bless- 
ing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do 
ordain and establish this constitution,' &c. The 
Declaration of American Independence, says^- 
' That to secure these rights [those of ' life, liber- 
ty, and the pursuit of happiness '] governments 
are instituted among men, that whenever any 

, form of government becomes destructive ofthese 
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abol- 
ish it, and to institute new Government,' &c. 
The quotations in the memorial refer to these : 
and yet the legislators of Massachusetts gravely 
suppose that ' the public good,' or ' the general 
welfare ' forbids the "■'establishment of justice \ 
and the giving of ' liberty,' by Congress, to one 
sixth of' the people ' living upon territory under 
its 'exclusive legislation'! Our legislators 
need light. Twenty thousand petitioners will 
give it. They will make it day-light again, and 
operate like magic on ' the public good ' ! 

Friends of th« sjave^ the work is yours— will, 
you do it? Eather'let^ me say, what* abolition-' 
ist is there that will not do it, and do it noiv? 
Oh! frienft ! how would the heart of the slav^ 
leap for joy, and that of his oppressor quake 
with fear, to see us, by our petitions, marchinn- 
up to our legislative halls, in a solid phalanx ol" ' 
TWENTY THOUSAND! Do your duty, one 
and all, and it can be done?
