New- York, October 29, 1833. 

""The friends of immediate emancipation, having met in the several cities of Boston, Providence New- 
York and Philadelphia, have concurred in the resolution to call a convention to meet at the latter place on 
the V/^ of December, to form a Nationai, Anti-Slavery Society. In accordance with the wishes of 
the friends in those places, we take the liberty to invite you, as a friend ofthe cause, to be present as a member 

of that convention. 
The motives for organizing such a Society without delay, are briefly the following : 

1 Union is strength. The advocates of the immediate abolition of slavery, though few compared with the 
whole mass of our population, and widely scattered, are many in the aggregate, and when combined will act 

with irresistible power. 

2 Thecauseisurgent, and must be injured by unnecessary delay. 

3. The public expectation is already excited, and the friends of our cause are to some extent committed to 
such a movement in the present year. ,., , , ^ ,., j i, j 

4 We have before us numerous examples of similar organizations.which, though feeble and obscure, and 
contemned by public opinion in the outset, have speedily risen to great influence, and been the means, under 
God, of immense benefit to the human race. Especially is this true of the National Anti-Slavery Society of 
Great Britain, and of the American Temperance Society. 

But it is unnecessary for us to enlarge ; we trust. Sir, that you wiU duly appreciate the importance of this 
subject, and wiU permit no ordinary engagement to prevent you from attending this convention Shou d you 
accept this invitation, on your arrival at Philadelphia you wUl please report yourself to Evan Lewis, No. 94 
North Fifth-street, who will inform you ofthe time and place of the meeting. y p ^ , 

Very respectfully, j,^ >.'-^ ^-t^^p^ ^^^ ^ 

Your friends and feUow laborers, ^--^^7 /^yyCV\ ^ O^^^l^-K. - 

P. S. To avoid interruption in our meetings, we wish this to be considered confidential. Should it be 
inconvenient for you to attend, will you please to transmit to us an expression of your views on the subject, 
addressed to E. Wright, Jr., Cor. Sec. of the N. Y. City Anti-Slavery Society, New- York.
