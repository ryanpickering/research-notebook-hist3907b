Ninth Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Fair. 



ADDRESS. 



The undersigned, deeply interested in the anti-sla- 
very cause, and feeling it to be one which will have 
the warmest support of every good man and woman, 
have decided to do what they can to condense and 
make available the good wishes of the community, by 
holding their Ninth Annual Fair during Christmas 
week, 1842. It is a laborious and costly undertaking 
to awaken a nation to the knowledge of its perilous 
condition by reason of slavery. To do it without stir- 
ring up the slaves to bloodshed, without exciting a 
party rage under the name of Philanthropy, and with- 
out yielding to opposition ; — to do it by the enuncia- 
tion of sublime truth, and by spreading abroad the 
knowledge of assured facts; this is the work be- 
fore us, to which the funds raised by means of the 
Fair will be devoted. Not a dollar of them will be 
expended in the labor of making an abolition party or 
an abolition sect, but in the promulgation among all 
men of the great forgotten principles of Freedom, 
without which every party and sect in the land are 
but leading it down to ruin, and without which no 
man may for a moment flatter himself that he is a pa- 
triot or a christian. 

The money raised will be expended in publishing 
and circulating the ablest writings, and in sustaining 
the most devoted and able persons who are found sac- 
rificing themselves to this service of Freedom. 

Millions of people are to be freed, and some will 
shrink back in alarm at the magnitude of the un- 
dertaking. We invite their participation in the work, 
with the promise of that expansion of soul, in conse- 
quence of their labors, which will enable them to feel 
that this is hut a portion of their work on earth. A 
few there are who say that the emancipation of the 
slaves of our country is too small and unsatisfactory a 
labor to engage their attention. We beg them to re 
member that it was a work worthy of a God to create 
men free, and therefore it cannot be beneath the at- 
tention of any human being to restore men to free- 
dom. To aid the progress of the human race is the 
greatest and the worthiest object. To aid it efiectual- 
ly involves the use of a multiplicity of means, which, 
however small in themselves, are not, on that account, 
the less necessary. The loftiest soul looks noblest in 
the discharge of the lowliest duties. To those whom 
fear drives back and self-interest hinders, we present a 
cause which has power even to make them forget them- 
selves, and to give them courage and nobleness. To 
those who are spiritless and lifeless for want of some 
deeply interesting occupation, who are consumed by 
ennui, and old in heart before their time, — to all who 
are enjoying prosperity, and to all who are suffering 
affliction, we present this cause as a blessing, a claim, 
and a consolation. 

There is no class or condition of men or women to 
.whom the call for help in such a cause does not come 
with commanding energy : and we call on all for aid, 



in the name of that truth, which has received our best 
years as its right.

0° Pledging ourselves to spare no pains to secure 
the best place of exhibition and sale the city affords, 
— to Omit no exertion to make the occasion one of en- 
joyment as well as endeavor, — to enlarge our hospi- 
tality to meet the large demands which we hope will 
be made upon it at the time of the Fair; — to execute 
carefully all orders, and to work up to the best ad- 
vantage all gifts of materials, — and, finally, to lose no 
means nor opportunity of making this Ninth Mas- 
SACHnsETTS Anti-Slaverv Fair a most important 
auxiliary to the cause of Freedom, we solicit the cor- 
respondence, co-operation and advice of all individu- 
als and societies that wish its advancement. 

[Jj" The latest designs for all small and elegant ob- 
jects for drawing-rooms supplied to those friends of 
the cause who are skilled in cabinet and chair work. 
The newest patterns of all kinds of fancy works and 
articles of ladies' and children's dress, will be furnish- 
ed to those who wish, and their aid ;s in turn solicit- 
ed to supply such as they possess. Farmers, manu- 
facturers and merchants, who wish to aid the cause 
by donations of their respective goods and products, 
will find the Fair an effectual opportunity. Dona- 
tions of money or materials, and an interchange of 
suggestion and advice may be made at 39 Summer- 
street, or 4 High-street. Letters and parcels address- 
ed to 25 Cornhill, will be safely forwarded to the 
managers. 

O" All persons intending to purchase Christmas 
and New Year's presents, are informed that our 
agents in Europe have already received such orders 
as will ensure a splendid choice for that purpose. 

O" Articles and donations for the annual, — ' The 
Liberty Bell,' (the fourth number of which will be 
issued the first day of the Fair, in a more beautiful 
style than the preceding ones) should be addressed to 
the editor, M. W. CHAPMAN, 

39 Summer-street.
