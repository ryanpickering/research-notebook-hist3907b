EXPLANATION OF THE CALENDAR PAGES. 

The 1st and 2d columns show the days of the month and week. 
The 3d and 4th the time of sun's rising and setting. The 5th the 
sun's declination south, that is, how many degrees and minutes north 
or south of the equator the sun is vertical. The distance of the sun 
from any place, in north latitude, may be found by adding the sun's 
southern dec'n,or subtracting its northern dec' n to or from the latitude 
of the place. Thus it will be found that on Dec. 2, the sun is 64° S. 
from Boston, while June 10, it is only 19° S. The 6th column shows 
the Equation of time, which see, on page 4. The 7th shows the time 
of moon's rising and setting. The 8th the time of the moon's southing. 
The 9th, time of High Water at Boston. The 10th shows the moon's 
place in the signs of the Zodiac, for the special edification of those 
who dare not begin any important work unless the ' sign is right. 
The 11th column needs no explanation.

THE WEATHER. 

Since the publication of our Almanac for 1836, we have been fre 
quently importuned to enlighten the public respecting the weather. 
We have therefore, like other Almanac-makers, hazarded a few 
guesses on the subject, with more caution than some of our brethren, 
though we hope, not with less accuracy. If persons wish to make 
their own calculations, ihey will find materials for making as good 
as any body can furnish by consulting the following 
TABLE 
For foretelling the Weather, through all the Lunations of each Year. 

This table and the accompanying remarks are the result of many 
years' actual observation; the whole being constructed on a due con- 
sideration of the attraction of the sun and moon, in their several posi- 
tions respecting the earth, and will, by simple inspection, show the 
observer what kind of weather will most probably follow the entrance 
of the moon into any of its quarters, and that so near the truth as to 
be seldom found to fail.

Observations. — The nearer the time of the moon's change to noon 
or midnight, the more nearly will the result accord with the predic- 
tions for the changes occurring between 10 and 2, A. M. or P. M. 
Less dependence can be placed on the table between October and 
April than in the rest of the year. The observer should be within 
sight of a good vane, and be very exact in noticing the direction of 
the wind. 

We derive this information from an astronomical friend, and have 
no doubt that it is as correct as any calculation on a subject ' as un- 
certain as the weather.' N. B. It will be observed that some of our 
predictions are upon subjects on which there is less danger of mistake

EQUATION OF TIME. 
Many persons, who are accustomed to R. B. Thomas's and other 
old-fashioned Almanacs, suppose that the time of the sun's rising and 
setting on any day is always at an equal distance from noon. This is 
true, if we regard solar or apparent time only, but it is not true by mean, 
or perfect clock time Formerly, when few persons had clocks, and 
fewer were guided by them, it was most convenient to reckon by appa- 
rent time, and regulate clocks by a noon mark. But now, when correct 
clocks and watches are so numerous, it is far better to have all calcula- 
tions expressed in clock time. To prevent misapprehension, we will 
try to explain the difference between the two modes of reckoning. 

The sun is within the orbit or path of the earth, T 6 ' 

but not in its centre, for the orbit is not an ex- 
act circle, but an ellipse,. as represented in the 
annexed figure; and the sun is nearer one part_„. 
of its orbit, as a, than it is to the other, as b. The a [ • ]& 

length of a solar or apparent day at any place 
is the time that passes after the meridian of that 
place [meridian is any line runningdirectly north 
and south,] is exactly beneath or opposite to the ^ c 

sun, till it comes again to the same relative position to the sun. This 
is more than one complete revolution of the earth on its axis, for the 
earth is moving forward in its orbit, in the direction a c b, while it is 
turning on its axis, and must turn enough farther each day to make up 
for its advance in its orbit. The earth actually turns on its axis 366 
times in going once round the sun, or in 365 days, and the time of the 
additional revolution is divided among the days of the year, but in 
unequal portions, and this is one cause of the difference between ap- 
parent and mean time. When the eai th is at a moving towards c, (be 
ing then near the sun,) it moves faster and of course farther in 24 hrs, 
than it does in the opposite part of its orbit, and any spot on the earth's 
surface must move farther in order to have one complete solar day. 
Hence, a solar day at any place will be more than 24 hrs. long ; and the 
middle of it will therefore be later than the middle of a day of regular 
length, i. e. it will not be noon by the svn till after it is noon by the 
clock, or, the sun will be slow of the clock. This difference, between 
clock and sun, will become greater and greater, by the continual action 
of the same cause, till the earth arrives at c, when the difference will 
be greatest. From c to d the earth moves more slowly in its orbit, and 
does not go so far in 24 hrs. This makes the solar day shorter than the 
medium length ; and brings the clock and sun nearer together, till at b 
they agree. From btod the solar day being shorter than a day by per- 
fect time, the places on any meridian will have passed the sun before it 
is ] 2 o'clock; or in other words, it will be noon by the sun before it is by 
the clock, and hence the sun will he fast. This effect will be greatest 
at d, and from d to a the sun will go faster again, till at a apparent and 
mean time will again agree. The actual difference between noon by 
the sun and noon by the clock is called the Equation of Time. 

If this were the only cause of difference, the sun would agree with 
the clock about Dee. 30, (earth being at a) and July 5, (b) ; would be 
slowest Mar. 30, (c) and fastest Sept. 30, (d.) There is another cause, 
however, resulting from the obliquity of the sun's apparent path in the 
heavens, which modifies the result, but we have no room to explain it. 

N. B. All the calculations in this Almanac are in mfan time.

Anti- Slavery Almanac. 



TO THE PUBLIC. 

Encouraged by your kind reception of my former labors, I have ven 
tured again to come before you. Again would I plead the cause of the 
injured slave, and his guilty master. I now ask you to look forward 
to the fast-approaching realities of the judgment day, when God shall 
judge the secrets of men, without RESPECT of PERSONS, and 
answer me, Shall I plead in vain? Will you shield your conscience 
from all the shafts of truth which may be directed towards it by urging 
the oft-repeated objection, that the slaves are well-used, contented and 
happy, and that all accounts of their wretchedness are false, or exag- 
gerated ? If so, stop a moment, and ask yourself, Who has the 
greatest facilities for making his own story heard, — the master, or the 
slave? Who are they that control the great avenues leading to the 
public mind? Who edit newspapers? who circulate them ? Whoare 
they that make speeches in Congress, and then frank them to all parts 
of the Union? Are they slaves or are they masters? Who have re- 
wards and honors to bestow upon their advocates ?■ Who have Presi- 
dential votes to give ? Who occupy the seats of the President, Sena- 
tors, Representatives, Governors, and Judges? The slaves or the 
masters ? When travellers go to the South, at whose tables do they sit, 
whose beds do they occupy, whose wine do they drink, whose story 
do they hear, whose flatteries and caresses do they receive, or whose 
threats do they dread ? The slaves', or the masters' ? Of the travel- 
lers that come to the North, who are found in intimate communion 
with our distinguished men? Who crowd our stages, cars, steamboats 
and hotels? Who have money to spend, and fortunes to give, and 
beautiful daughters, with their splendid dowers, to be wooed and won? 
The slaves, or the masters ? On whom do our northern merchants, 
editors, publishers of books and papers, officers of colleges and theo- 
logical institutions, teachers, lawyers, and ministers, depend for pa- 
tronage and support? On the slaves, or on the masters ? In view of 
these things, can we expect that a thousandth part of the wrongs, cru- 
elties and indignities suffered by the slaves, will be permitted to come 
to our knowledge ? Will not everything that can be said in favor of 
the master, and against the slave, be carried on every breeze, and mul- 
tiplied by echoes from every Stone and every Hill? From which side 
are we to mike deductions for interest, personal feeling, party spirit, 
or virtual bribery on the part of the witnesses? I might go much 
farther; but here is enough. 

I beg of you to bear these things in mind when you are examining 
testimony respecting slavery. But we have the authority of slave- 
holders themselves for all the important statements we make; and a 
man's testimony against himself is never exaggerated. 

In preparing the matter for this number, I have been guided by the 
principles which were set forth last year. I again solicit your candid 
and scrutinizing attention to what is here advanced, and your hearty 
co-operation in disseminating these principles, unless you are prepared 
to show their falsity. 

Let us remember that we shall soon meet each other, and those for 
whom we are called upon to labor, at the bar of our Father, and their 
Father, andaet so that we may rejoice to hear our Saviour say, Inas- 
much as ye did it unto one of the least of these MY BRETHREN, ye 
did it unto ME. Your Obt. Servt.

20, 1836. Fourth Annual meeting of 'the Mass. A.S.S. held in Boston. 

25, 1834 Insurrection of slaves in Bahia, Brazil. The plot was detect- 
ed several hours before it was intended to carry it into execution. 
When the slaves found their plans were defeated, many of them 
rushed on the bayonets of the opposing soldiers, preferring death 
to slavery. 

25, 1784. Daniel Shays, at the head of 1150 insurgents, made an at-

part}" dispersed 

30, 1835. Attempt to assassinate the President of the U. S. 

30, 1832. The New-England Anti-Slavery Society formed at Boston 
This was the first Society of the kind which was formed in the U. 
S. It is now called the Massachusetts A. S. Society. 



THE NEW YEAR. 
Reader, again we have met, under circumstances of awful solemnity. 
! It is not a time for adulation.' 1 dare not waste my breath with vain 
greetings. Another year has rolled over this guilty land, and carried 
its irreversible account to the bar of him whose arm is clothed with 
thunder, and whose right hand is full of the arrows of wrath, with which 
to smite the proud oppressor. The year which has closed upon us has 
gone to tell of fraud, iniquity, robbery of the poor and needy, separation 
of mothers and children, mockery of marriage ties, minds crushed, 
and souls sent, sightless, to a cheerless grave. It has carried an ac- 
count of mercies slighted, privileges perverted, and blessings abused 
This year, too, will soon pass away, and shall its account be dark and 
bloody as that of the preceding ? Shall it be, did 1 ask ? Even now i! 
may be determined that it shall not be. The decree may already have 
been sealed in the immutable counsels of Jehovah, that this shall be a 
year of retiibution. God has bestswed upon us distinguishing mercies, 
such as no other nation ever enjoyed, and he has " looked for judgmep* 
but behold oppression ; for righteousness, but behold a cry/' - Shall 1 
not visit for these things, saith the Lord, shall not my soul be avenged 
on such a nation as this ? " Even now the last faint plea of mercy 
may have been uttered, and urged in vain He may already lave be- 
gun to " whet his glittering sword," that it may drink the blood of 
those who have trampled under »>ot and defaced his glorious image in 
his oppressed children. Have j-ou no sacrifice to make, no plea to urce. 
no prayer to offer, that you may stay the coming wrath? If so, what 
thou djest, do quickly, for the violence which is abroad in the 
land, like the low rumbling which precedes an earthquake, too 
clearly portends, that a storm of desolating vengeance is about to burst 
upon us, unless we speedily repent, and bring forth fruits mcM for re- 
pentance. 

" Up then in freedom's manly part, 

From gray beard eld to fiery youth, 

And on the nation's naked heart, 
Scatter the living coals of truth." 



1837] JANUARY — FIRST MONTH. [31 days. 


During this month, in 1817, a meeting of more than 3,000 free 
people of color assembled in Philadelphia to express their views of 
the Am. Col. Soc., then just formed, at. which they unanimously re- 
plied to the question, whether they were willing to accept the offers 
of that Society, with one long, loud, tremendous NO. 

Other meetings of colored people, expressing similar sentiments, 
were held in most of the cities and large towns in the northern states, 
and it was their unyielding opposition to the cruel scheme of expulsion 
that first induced Mr. Garrison and his friends to oppose it.

2, 1836. R. I. State Anti-Slavery Society formed in Providence. 

4, 1835. Gen. Wade Hampton died at Columbia, S. C., aged 80. He 
was a soldier in the revolution ; he afterwards became very wealthy 
and was said to be the owner of 1500 slaves ; he fought for freedom 
and he practised oppression ; he defended the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence and he lived down its principles ; he resisted tyranny and 
became a tyrant ; he bore arms for the rights of man, and then rob- 
bed his fellow man of their rights. Probably few men ever amassed 
a larger fortune by agriculture, and very few have been punished 
for robbery who ever practised it on a larger scale. 

15, 1835. Nathan Dane, L. L. D., died at Beverly, Mass. He was 
the framer of the ordinance of Congress of 1787, for the govern- 
ment of the Ter. N. W. of the Ohio river. By this code the princi- 
ples of free government to the exclusion of slavery were secured to 
the inhabitants of that immense region. 

18,1834. Wm. Wirt died. 

18, 1835. Third Anniversary of the Vermont Anti-Slavery Society. 

19, 1795. Moses Fiske, a tutor in Dartmouth College, and afterwards 
Judge in Tennessee, preache'd an excellent sermon on American 
slavery, entitled " Tyrannical liberty-men." 

20, 1835. The brig Enterprise of N. Y., E. Smith, master, which sailed 
from the Dis. o? Col. to Charleston, S. C. with 78 slaves on board, 
put into Bermuda in distress. The next day at the instance of the 
Friendly Society of colored people, the slaves were brought before 
the Chief Justice of the place, and all of them except a woman and 
five children chose to remain there and be free rather than to go 
back to the U. S. and were accordingly liberated. There is reason 
to believe that the five children will heap many bitter curses on the 
mother for the choice she then made. 

22, 1732. Washington born, — "that slave holder," (Peleg Sprague.) 
22, 1836. Anti-Abolition meeting in Cincinnati. 

22, 1836. Message of the President to Congress announcing that the 
difficulties with France were settled. 



FREE DISCUSSION. 

While the spirit of mobocracy, like a hot blast from the infernal 
pit, was sweeping over the land, parching the fair flowers which j 
adorned the fields of social order, and withering the wholesome fruits | 
upon the tree of liberty, our hearts were cheered, and our spirits re- 
freshed by the following noble sentiments from the lips of Gerrit 
Smith, of Peterborough, N. Y. They are brief extracts from hisj 
speech at Peterborough, befoie the N. Y. State A. S. Society. For 
their utterance at that time, we are indebted to the UTICA MOB. 
They are published here, although they have been already widely 
circulated, because we wish to have them kept before the public 
mind, and deeply impressed upon every heart. They were founded 
, upon the following resolution : 

Resolved, That the right of free discussion, given to us by our God, 
and asserted and guarded by the laws of our country, is a right so 
vital to man's freedom, and dignity, and usefulness, that we can nev- 
er be guilty of its surrender, without consenting to exchange that 
freedom for slavery, and that dignity and usefulness, for debasement 
and worthlessness. 

I love our free and happy government. But not because it confers

ASSERTION. "If the slaves were set free, they could nt take care of 
themselves." li If they could, ice would set thcmfr/tc." 

This accounts for the fact that as soon as a slave leaves his master, 
with the intention of taking care of himself, the master, with a most 
tender concern for his welfare, instantly offers from $ 20 to $ I GOO to 
any one who will leturn him to his kind ' patriarchal ' supervision. In 
advertising the deluded beings, who are running away from their hap- 
piness, they will, of course be very exact in describing them. The fol- 
lowing are specimens of the phrases applied to slaves in advertisements.

4, 1885. School for the reception of col. pupils opened in Canaan, N. H. 
4 and 8,1836. A Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature granted 

a partial hearing to the Abolitionists who attempted to show cause

" A full statement" of reasons has since been published. 

5, 1770. Boston Massacre in King, (now State) St. 

10, 1836. Resolution passed the Senate of New-York, directing the 
Committee on Literature to inquire in the propriety of withhold- 
ing from Oneida Institute its share of the literary fund. 

13, 1833. Great Anti-Colonization meeting at Exeter Hall, London. 

19, 1835. Kentucky State Anti-Slavery Society foimed at Danville. 

20, 1831. Insurrection of the slaves in Antigua, which lasted 5 days. 
24, 1828. Memorial for the Abolition of Slavery in the Dis. of Col. 

presented to Congress signed by upwards of 1000 of the inhabitants 
of the Dis. 

30, 1830. The Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature, to whom 
was referred the memorial of Geo. Odiorne, requesting them to re- 
monstrate with Southern Legislatures against those laws and reg- 
ulations which operate injuriously upon the inhabitants of the free 
States, granted a full hearing to Messrs. May and Sewall'on the 
subject. The evidence produced on that occasion was very full, 
and the Committee gave it an attentive hearing. See page 

31, 1836. Fast-d-'.y in New-Hampshire. George Storrs delivered an 
anti-slavery address in Pittsfield, N. H. After the close of the ad-

House of Correction. He appealed from the sentence. 

31, 1836. Disturbance at Concord, N. H. Five persons, four of whom 
were constables, arrested and fined. 



any new rights upon us. Our rights spring from a nobler source 
than human constitutions — from the favor of Almighty God. 

We are not indebted to the Constitution of the United States or of 
this State, for the right of free discussion. We are thankful that they 
have hedged it about with so noble a defence. We are thankful, 1 
say. that they have neither restrained nor abridged it; but we owe 
them no thanks for our possession of rights which God gave us. 
And the proof that he gave them, is in the fact that he requires us to 
exercise them. 

This right is generally defended as something which our free gov- 
ernment has given us, as what was earned by the toil and purchased 
by the blood of our fathers. Sir, this is an error. And men in de- 
nying this right, are not only guilty of violating the constitution, and 
destroying the blessings bought by the blood and toil of our fathers, 
but guilty of making open war with God himself. I want to see this 
right placed on this true, this infinitely high ground, as a DIVINE 
right. I want to see men defend it, and exercise it with that belief. 
I want to see men determined to maintain to their extremest beunda-

1, 1772. Petition from the white inhabitants of Virginia, for the 
suppression of the slave trade presented to the House of Burgesses 
for that colony. 

2, 1743. Jefferson born. " I tremble for my country when I remem- 
ber that God is just." 

13, 1835. Dr. F. A. Cox and Rev. Mr. Hoby arrived in N. Y. as dele 
gates from the Baptist Churches in G. B. to those in this country. 

17,1760. Benj. Franklin died, aged 84. 

28, 1822. The ceremony of taking possession of Cape Montserado 
p.nd the adjoining country in Liberia, was this day performed ; the 
land had been purchased in Dec. 1821. 



ries, ALL the rights which God, his Governor, has given him for 
his enjoyment, his dignity, and his usefulness. 

This right of free discussion, sir, there is one class of men who 
ought to be particularly tenacious of. 1 mean, poor men. These 
constitute the most numerous class, in every country, and therefore 
to the true philanthropist, they are of the greatest value. When the 
rich are divested of their lights, they have still their riches and lion 
ors to rest on for dignity and for defence. But when the poor man is 
divested of his right to speak, he is divested of all his rights. Take 
from him that in which, almost alone, he stands on equal ground with 
his rich neighbor, the freedom of speech, and, sir, the man of poverty 
will soon find himself wholly at the mercy of the man of wealth. 
The poor men in Utica, whom we saw led en by men of wealth to a 
violent assault against free discussion, will yet see the suicidal char- 
acter of their proceedings. The rights, which they have attacked in 
your persons, are their own dearest rights, without which they can- 
not help being trampled into the dust by wealth and title, just as 
wealth and title have always of old trampled into the dust those who 
have not this right to speak. 

And for what purpose are we called to throw down our pens and 
Iseal up our lips, and sacrifice our influence over our fellow men. by 
the use of free discussion 1 ? If it was for an object of benevolence, 
that we were called to renounce that freedom of speech with which 
God made us, there would be some color of fitness in the demand. 
But such a sacrifice, the cause of truth and mercy never calls us to 
make. That cause requires the exertion, not the siippression of our 
noblest powers. But here we are called on to degrade, unman our- 
selves, and to withhold from our fellow men that influence wfijch we 
ought to exercise for their good. And for what? I will tell you for 
what. That the oppressed may lie more passive at the feet of the 
oppressor; that one-sixth of our American people may never know 
their rights; that two and a half millions of our own countrymen, 
crushed in the cruel fioids of slavery, may remain in all their misery 
and despair, without pity and without hope. 

I knew before that slavery would not survive free discussion. But 
the demands recently put forth by the South, for our surrender of the 
right of discussion, and the avowed reasons of that demand, involve 
a. full concession of this fact, that free discussion is incompatible with 
slavery. The South, by her own showing, admits that slavery can- 
not live, unless the North is tongue tied. 

" Shall we give up our liberty to preserve southern slavery, or shall 
the South give up their slavery to secure the liberties of the nation P"

that l the mainspring ' to activity and enterprise has been torn from i 






them : and yet we are asked to believe the ridiculous humbug, that if 






the mainspring of LIBERTY were inserted in their breasts, these 






i first rate ' workmen couldn't earn their living !!!:,!! 






A colored man who had paid $1800 for his freedom, was asked if the 






slaves could take care of themselves. He stretched out his strong 






arms, as he answered, " These hands were able to take care of my 






master in the day-time, and to earn enough in the night to pay for! 
myself three times." N. B. He had twice been treacherously sold,! 










after paying $600 for himself each time. " A land of liberty and law ! !"!

the following agents. A. A. Phelps, Thomas Huntington, George 
Storrs, Theodore D. Weld, Henry B. Stanton, Samuel L. Gould, Au-

the progress of the cause of human freedom in their respective spheres 
of action, and of all their labors and efforts for the promotion of this 
cause, previous to May, 1837, and to send in similar reports to each 
annual meeting of the A. A. S. Society, which shall be held thereafter 
Reader, are you an officer in any Anti- Slavery Society ? If so, it h 
your duty to see that this is done. 

On motion of T.rS Wright, a colored clergyman of N. Y. it was 

Resolved, That it be recommended to each of the Auxiliarv Societies 
to appoint a standing committee on introducing our colored brethren 
to the useful arts, with instructions to ascertain the number of colored 
persons in their several districts, who are desirous of learning the 
useful arts, and especially those who are desirous of becoming regulaj 
apprentices to such mechanics as are willing to teach them trades 
and treat them as they do their other apprentices. 

Faith without works is dead. Show me your faith by your works 
Abolitionists have long neglected this matter. Up and be doing. 

N. E. Convention, which met in Boston, the 24th of the same 



Th< 



month, was attended by 500 delegates, all of whom evinced an unshaken 
determination to press on till they should meet with death or victory. 



1837] 



MAY — FIFTH MONTH. 



[31 days. 



Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together. — This 
is the month for anti-slavery meetings. Let all who ever go abroad, 
come up and warm their hearts at the altars of abolition. Let them 
fill their vessels at the gashing founts of emancipation; and then, if 
they take sentimental journeys among the mountains, they will dif- 
fuse a holy warmth around them : or if they visit fashionable watering 
places, where slave-holders congregate, they will not forget that " he 
that watereth shall be watered also himself." Let abolitionists "speak 
often one to another," and strengthen each other's hands.

pan, W. L. Garrison, and Dr. Cox, of Auburn, N. Y. In conse- 
quence of this outrage, the Ex. Com. of the A. A. S. S. published 
a notice informing the public that copies of the publications thus 
destroyed were to be had gratuitously at the Society's office, and 
immediately the room was thronged with a concourse of citizens 
eager to obtain copies of the " incendiary publications," so that 
many thousands read them, who, but for the P. O. robbery at 
Charleston, would never have seen them. This is one among ma- 
ny specimens of the way in which our enemies are helping our 
cause. 






1837] JULY— SEVENTH MONTH. [31 days. 




Advertisement. Whereas, a certain fanatical and pestilent luminary 
called the North Stau, (in the heavens) has for many yearsoutraged 
public sentiment, and with wanton disregard of southern rights and 
interests, has wilfully and maliciously aided and abetted in the escape 
of "runaway slaves, we do hereby offer a reward of $100,000, to any 
person who will safely deliver the said north star to the chairman of 
the Louisiana Constitutional and Anti-Fanatical Society, or who will 
! in any way put a stop to its impertiner.t interference with the security 
of private property.

AUGUST beems on TUESDAY. 



[1837 



1, 1834. Emancipation of all the slaves in the British Colonies. 
1, 1827. The importation of slaves into Alabama from other States 
prohibited after this date., 

3, 1825. Public meeting in the City-Hall, Charleston. Committee of 
twenty-one appointed to take charge of the U. S. Mail, &c. 

4, 1825. Great meeting in the Capitol, Richmond, Va., to Revise 
measures to put down the abolitionists. 

4, 1835. Amos Kendall, the Post-Master General, wrote to the P. M. 
at Charleston, S. C. in reference to his having detainedanti-slavery 
publications at the office. He says, " I cannot sanction and will net 
condemn the step you have taken," and that it is " patriotism to 
disregard the laws " in certain cases. 

8, 1S35. Great riot at Baltimore, occasioned by an alleged fraud on 
the part of the officers of the. Bank of Maryland. A law has since 
been passed by the Legislature of the State indemnifying the suf- 
ferers by the mob. 

10, 1835. Canaan Academy, N. H., drawn off by a mob for the crime 
of admitting colored youth. 

10, 1835. Disturbance at Worcester, Mass. While Rev. O. Scott 
w r as lecturing on slavery, Levi Lincoln, jr. and Patrick Doyle, an 
Irishman (fit associates) tore up the lecturer's notes, and offered 
violence to his person, but were prevented from doing him harm. 

11,1835. Dr. Reuben Crandall thrown into prison at" Washington, 
D. C, for having in his trunk Anti-Slavery papers. 

24,1759. Wilberforce born. 26, 1832. Adam Clarke died, aged 72. 



EMANCIPATION IN THE WEST INDIES. 

The act of partial justice performed on the first day of this month, 
1834, has received the sanction of the God of Providence, just so far 
as it was in conformity with the precepts of revelation. It is indeed 
a, humiliating reflection that men, professing to believe the Bible,! 
should catch eagerly at every sentence contained in a West India 
gazette, to ascertain whether the declarations of Jehovah are true or 
false. — to see whether it is safe to obey his law. Is not this insult- 
ing the Lord of Hosts ? The intelligence received from the West 
Indies continues to give " confirmations strong " to what before rested 
immovably upon " proofs from Holy Writ." The following informa- 
tion was communicated to the editor of the New-York Evangelist, 
by an intelligent merchant who spent more than a year in Barbadoes 
after the act" of emancipation took place. At that time the island, 
which is 21 miles long and 12 broad, contained 20,000 whites, 20,000 
free people of color, and 80,000 slaves, being one of the most populous 
countries on earth. 

Many who opposed the abolition of slavery step by step to the last, 
are now in favor of it. They say it has been a good thing for the 
island. Ml fears of evil consequences have been disappointed. 

He could lie down to sleep there out of doors, as quietly as in any 
place in New England. 

As to the fear that abolishing slavery will lead to amalgamation, it 
operates precisely the other way. Amalgamation has had its full run 
there, under the reign of slayery. You may go into a church now, 
and see two hundred and fifty persons at a time, of whom you cannot 
determine confidently whether they are white or colored. It has been 
a common thing there for white men to keep colored women. Even 






1837] 



AUGUST — EIGHTH MONTH- 



[31 days. ; 



Anecdote. — A crockery -ware dealer, in Boston, who attended the Fan- 
euil Hall meeting of Aug. 21, 1835, and was very active in manifesting 
his fraternal regard for his southern brethren, had the good fortune to 
attract the gracious notice of one of those high-minded noblemen. On 
the following day, the southern gentleman condescended to enter the 
shop of his zealous friend, and inquired if he had any little china 
things for children; " for," said he, "you behaved very well at the 
meeting yesterday, and 1 think I'll purchase something of you.'

22 SEPTEMBER begins on FRIDAY. T1837. 



2, 1835. Riot at Pittsburgh, Pa. The rioters attempted to destroy a 
shop occupied by a barber, but were dispersed by the mayor. 

17, 1835. The grand jury of Oneida co. N. Y. made a presentment, 
in which they say that those who are getting up abolition societies, 
" for the purpose of printing pictures and inflammatory publica- 
tions," are guilty of sedition, and of right ought to be punished ; 
and that it is the duty of all our citizens, who are friendly to the 
constitution of the U. S. and the future quiet and happiness of this 
people, to DESTROY all such publications, whenever and wherever 
found. 

17," 1835. A gallows was erected in front of Mr. Garrison's in 
Brighton street, Boston, with this inscription : " By order of Judge 
Lynch." We are glad to say, however, that the authority of the 
Judoewas not sufficient to procure the execution of any one upon it. 

17, 1796. Date of Washington's Farewell Address. 

20, 1834. George Thompson arrived at New York from England. 

25, 1835. Duke W. Hullurn, of Tennessee, father of one of the gamb- 
lers executed at Vicksburgh, addressed an able letter to the Governor 
of Mississippi, praying that the murderers of his son and confed- 
erates might be brought to justice. 



married men did it. Every body says this is becoming now far less 
common, and the colored women, who used to be kept as concubines 
of white men, are now getting colored husbands. It takes the minister 
at Bridgetown a quarter of an hour to publish the bans of marriage. 

Since the abolition act took effect, all efforts for the advancement 
of the colored population in knowledge and religion, are greatly in- 
creased, all obstacles are removed, and every body is in favor of it, 
without a dissenting voice. They see their safety in it. They say, 
" We must make them intelligent and moral, for our own safety." 

Real estate, in many instances, has risen one third in a year. 

A hurricane, in 1831, destroyed most of the parish churches on the 
island. Many of then? have lain in ruins till the past year. Now 
they are rapidly rebuilding. 

It is not the case that the negroes become impudent towards .the 
whites, in consequence of emancipation. On the contrary, it is uni- 
versally said that they are more civil than they used to be. 

That Anti-Slavery Societies may have matter for interesting dis- 
cussion, during the coming fall and winter, we present the following 
QUESTIONS, Proper for discussion in And- Slavery Societies. 
" Prove all tilings. Hold fast that which is good." 

Abolitionists love discussion. It furnishes the food on which our principles live 
and flourish. Let us all become well acquainted with the use of this right arm of 
our strength. If we would contend successfully for the truth, we must thoroughly 
understand the whole subject of slavery in all its bearings. Let the. following ques 
tions, then, be carefully examined, and fully discussed. 

1. Is it the duty of Christian churches to exclude slave-holders from 
their communion, and slave-holding ministers from their pulpits? 
Eph. v. 7, 11. Ps. xxvi. 5. 1 Cor. v. 9, 10, 11. 2 Thess. iii. 6. 2 Tim. iii 5. 

2. Ought abolitionists to encourage any plan of amelioration, discon- 
nected with emancipation ? 

3. Ought abolitionists to advocate any system of preparation for free- 
dom ? '

"~ • [1837 j 

1 , 1834. Thomas S. Grirnke of Charleston, S. C. died near Columbus,j 
Ohio, in his 48th year. 

1, 1835. The Presbyterian synod of Michigan, assembled at Adrian,' 
passed excellent and thorough-going resolutions on the subjects of 
sabbath-breaking, intemperance, slavery and war. 

15, 1835. The committee of vigilance of East Feliciana, La. offered 
a reward of $50,000 for the delivery of Arthur Tappan to them. 

21, 1835. The New- York State Anti-Slavery* Society formed. After 
its formation, the convention was broken up by the Utica Mob, 
headed by Sam'l Beardsley, Member of Congress! ! ! 

21,1835. A mob of 5000 "gentlemen of property and standing,"; 
assembled in Washington street, Boston, in broad day-light and, 
Broadcloth, which succeeded in demolishing one sign board, caused 
the female anti-slavery society to change their place of meeting, 
broke through a panel door, destroyed -several prayer books, and 
performed some other equally brave exploits. 

23, 1835. Riot at Montpelier, Vt. 



4. Ought abolitionists to give countenance to any plan of compensa 
tion to the masters for giving the slaves their liberty ? 

A -writer from Antigua says, " A clergyman remarked to, me that it was pretty 
generally conceded that the -$t00, 000, 000 granted as a compensation to the slave- 
holders heie, was equivalent to a free gift: the value of the property not being 
diminished, but even rising." 

5. Can abolitionists consistently. belong to the American Colonization 
Society ? 

See Jay's Enquiry and Garrison's Thoughts. Passim. 

6. Will the abolition of slavery have a tendency to make the slave- 
holders, as a class, poorer than they now are? 

7. Will the' discussion of the subject of slavery have a tendency to ! 
-divide the Union ? 

8. Would a division of the Union be in any respect a benefit to the 
south ? 

9. Does the Constitution of the United States, properly interpreted, 
afford any countenance to the system of slavery ? 

Art. T. Sect. 2. No. 2. — Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned 
among the several Slates, according to their respective numbers, which shall be 
determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those hound to 
service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other| 
persons. 

Art. F. Sect. 9, No. ].— The migration or importation of such persons as any of 
the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the 
Congress prior to the year 1808. 

10. Can abolitionists consistently take an oath to support the Consti- 
tution of the U. S. or can they vote for any person to fill an office 
where he will be required to take such an oath ? 

11. Are slave-holders under obligation to obey those laws which pro 
hibit the emancipation or instruction of their slaves ? 

* Acts iv. 19; v. 29. Ex. i.17. 1 Kings xii. 28— 30; xiv. 16; xxi. 1— 14. 2 Chr. xxiv. 
16—20. Dan. iii. 18;»vi. 6—11. Hosea v. 31. Mic'ah vi. 16. Matt. xxii. 21. 
Heb. xi. 23. Mark vii. 7— 9. 1 Sam. xv. 24. These passages clearly show that we 
ought not to obey king or people if they command us contrary to God's law. 

12. Is a slave-holder justified in retaining the legal relation of master 
to his slaves, while he pays them for their labor and in other re- 
spects treats them as freemen? 

1 Thess. v. 22. Ex. xxiii. 7. 2 Cor. vi. 3; viii. 21. Slaves being chattels per 
sonal are liable to be sold for the debts of a living or deceased master.

most sacred rights of life and liberty, in the persons of a distant people, 
who never offended him, captivating them and carrying them into 
SLAVERY in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their 
transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel 
powers, is a warfare of a Christian king of Great Britain. Determined 
to keep open a market where MEN should be bought and sold, he has 
prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to pro- 
hibit or restrain this EXECRABLE COMMERCE.— Committee, T. 
Jefferson, J. Adams, Franklin, Livingston &, Sherman.

It is stud, " The South will not molest our liberty, if we will not 
molest their slavery; they do not wish to restrict us, if we will cease 
to speak of their peculiar institutions." I reply, — The liberty we 
contend for, is bestowed by God, and we will have it as he gave it. 
Our liberty is not an ex gratia privilege, conceded to us by the South, 






and which we are to have, more or less, as they please to allow. No, sir. 
The liberty which the South proffers us, to speak and write and print, 
of we do not touch that subject, is a liberty we do not ask, a liberty 
which we do not accept, but which we scornfully reject. — Gerrit Smith

Anti-Slavery Almanac. 



[163: 



PRLNCIPLFS OF ANTI-SLAV KllY SOCIETIES. 

" Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he 
doeth ? " Nicodemus. 

We solicit the candid attention of our readers to the following forci- 
ble expositions of our sentiments, from the pen of Mr. Goodell, 
extracted from the " Declaration and Expose" of the Rhode Island 
Anti-Slavery Convention, of Feb. 2, 1836. The whole document is a 
clear, full, and lucid exhibition of the great principles of truth, on 
which our Societies are based, as upon a moveless rock. Such decla- 
rations are coming in upon us from every quarter, with every variety 
of style, full of rich and beautiful illustration, and clothed with lan- 
guage of irresistible power. But though their number is so great, 
their style so diversified, and their origins so different, yet the most 
keen-sighted opponent cannot detect in them the slightest disagree- 
ment They are like so many refieshing streams, from the exhaustless 
fountain of truth. 

Oar Principles. 

We recognize the inherent, eternal, and unalterable distinction and 
opposition between right and wrong ; the rectitude and supreme au- 
thority of God's law; the mutual obligations and corresponding 
duties and rights of all moral beings. 

We hold human rights to be inalienable ; because their correspond- 
ing duties are unchanging ; because moral qualities are indelible; 
because the human soul is'immortal : because the law of God is irre- 
pealable ; because the throne of God is immovable ; because the 
Sovereign Benefactor who ordained and conferred them is not man 
that he should lie, or the son of man that he should repent. 

The Magna Charta ©f these rights we peruse in the sacred scrip- 
tures — their signet we see enstamped upon every son of Adam — 
their evidence we feel interwoven in the very fibres of our own exis- 
tence. Their denial we consider to be a denial of the law and of the 
gospel — a libel upon human nature, and a blasphemy against Him 
who created man in his- own linage. 

We claim these rights for ourselves, and consequently for all men. 
We claim them on the ground of our common human nature. We 
claim them because we are men. not because we are Americans; or 
Europeans, or Asiatics, or Africans. We claim them because we 
sustain the responsibilities which require their exercise, not because 
our fathers successfully resisted certain encroachments upon them. 
We claiiTLthem as men, not as rich men, or as poor men ; — not as 
learned or unlearned men ; — not as tall men, or as short men ; — not 
as having straight hair, or crisped hair ; — or blue eyes or black eyes, 
or as being white, or red, or olive, or tawny, or brown, or sible,in our 
complexions i We claim them as men, not as " men of property and 
standing :" — as men ; not as laborers, still less, as idlers ! 
Our Objects. 

It is for the rights of MAN that \vn are contending — the right* of 
ALL men — our own rights — the rights of our neighbor — the liber- 
ties of our country — of our posterity — of our fellow men — of all 
nations, and of all future generations. 

It is for principles, great principles, fundamental and unalterable 
principles, the principles of truth, of righteousness, and of freedom — 

It is for practices in accordance with correct principles — 

It is with the weapons of truth, in the warfare against error — 



1837] 



Anti-Slaverg Almanac. 



31 



It is to the diaXh struggle between American Slavery and Amer- 
icas Freedom that we have come up.- — it is in the great moral 
conflict between the practices of oppression and the precepts of 
righteousness, that we gird on our armor. Lower objects than these 
we disclaim, from whatever quarter they may be attributed to us. 

By the principles of peace and righteousness addressed to the mas- 
ter, we hope for the enfranchisement of the slave in season to avert 
the bloody catastrophe, anticipated by Mr. Jefferson. 

By the wise and prompt use of the liberties we enjoy under the Con- 
stitution, we hope to terminate those glaring infringements of it w...ch 
now threaten its existence. 

We hope to bury sectional jcolovsy in the grave of the only demon 
that, in our country, has ever engendered it: — we mean Stave/ ij. 

By persuading our Southern brethren voluntarily to remove "the 
curse entailed upon thorn" by their own criminal consent, we hope to 
8efe the entire South budding and blossomingas the rose, and becoming 
as the garden o! God. The redemption of the oppressor fiom the 
bondage of sin; his rescue by timely repentance from the long defer- 
red judgments of heaven ; and his participancy in the rich blessings of 
many ready to perish, are among the objects dearest our hearts. 

We seek nothing less than the overthrow of despotism by the prin 
eiples of freedom; the termination of oppression by the reign of 
righteousness — the establishment of liberty by the supremacy of law 

— the conformity of law to the spirit of liberty. 

We hold that emancipation should be immediate, unconditional, and 
universal. 

It should be immediate — because, since slavery is a" sin, it cannot 
be continued without a continuance of sin: — Because if inalienable 
rights maybe withheld, on the score of an expediency of which the 
legislator or the interested party may be the judge, there can be no j)os- 
sible security for the liberty of any man, or of any community. So 
thatji denial of this duty is a denial of human rights and a warfare 
against universal liberty. 

It should be unconditional — for the. reasons just stated : Because all 
sin should be unconditionally abandoned: Because it is an abrogation 
of all law and all liberty, to extend to a man his rights on conditions : 
Because, there can be none but unrighteous conditions imposed upon 
a man as an indispensable pre-requisite for allowing him the exercise of 
his inherent rights! A man has a perfect right, for example, to a cer- 
tain house. May the unlawful occupant restore it to him on condi- 
tions ! No. But what is any man's right in a house comparca with 
every man's right in himself? 

It should be universal — for all the reasons already enumerated : Be- 
cause every man is as much entitled to his ir.alienable rights as an?/ man 
can be. If there be a slave on earth who ought not to be immediately 
emancipated, then there is no freeman on earth, who holds any sub- 
stantial and valid title to his freedom. 
Safety. 

To say that immediate emancipation is not safe, is to say that it is 
not safe for human beings to obey their Creator. 

To deny the safety of immediate emancipation, is to doubt the first 
principles of common sense — the operations of moral cause and effect 

— and the testimony of universal experience and history. The writ- 
ings of CHarkson and Stuart have triumphantly es tablished this point, 



32 Anti-Slavery Almanac. \ [18 J? 



and the world has been challenged in vain to produce an instance of 
starvation or bloodshed, in consequence of emancipation. 

To say thatimmediateemancipationisnotsa/e, is to say that it is not 
safe for human beings tobefree! It is to say, what the despots of all 
ages and nations have said, and still say — that the laboring classes of 
mankind are incapable of self-government, and ought to be kept under 
the control of their superiors! 

Explanations. 

Emancipation from slavery does not confer the right of suffrage, 
but we contend that colored persons should be allowed its exercise, as 
soon as they possess the qualifications required of other citizens. They 
should also be aided and countenanced in their endeavors, by moral 
and intellectual culture, to become respectable and useful members of 
society. 

We do not ask that they shall be harassed, and the country burden- 
ed by an oppressive and vexatious system of apprenticeship for grown 
men, as in Jamaica — but that they shall be employed as free laborers 
and paid equal and just wages, as in Bermuda and Antigua, where they 
are industrious and happy, and their employers safe and prosperous. 

By the abolition of slavery we mean simply the repeal of the iniqui- 
tous slave code — the abolition of the unrighteous things wherein 
slavery consists — the restoration of men from the condition of " chat- 
tels" to the condition of rational beings. If there are any reasons 
why this abolition should nol take place now. they are reasons which 
will be equally valid, in all future time. And they are reasons urged 
against the inalienable rights of man, and the immutable Unas of God ! 

"THE OLD WASTE PLACES," — Isa. 58: 15. 

Of the multitude who seek an asylum in the empire of liberty, how 
many turn their steps to the region of the slave? None. There is a 
malaria in the atmosphere of those regions, witnessed in a sparse 
population of freemen, deserted habitations, and fields without cul- 
ture. Even the wolf, after the lapse of a hundred years, returns to 
howl over the desolations of slavery. Mr. Custis of Virginia. 

A Quaker gentleman who was travelling in Virginia, said that in 
one day, in which he rode more than fifty miles, more than half the 
plantations which he passed were deserted. 



Consistency. A South Carolinian, getting warmly engaged in 
an argument with an abolitionist of Boston, expressed himself in the 
following manner : '-' Slaveholders are very careful of the happiness 
of their slaves, and are constantly endeavoring to render their situa- 
tion pleasant. When sick, they are kindly provided for, and they 
are never required to make more exertion than other laborers. But 
when Northerners come to the South, they are the most cruel of all men. 
They task every muscle and sinew if a slave to get from him a large 
amount of work. In consequence o' which the slave-holders, [so 
careful of the happiness of their slaves will g :,r e several hundred 
dollars more per year for a northern oversea;- .^ar tor one born at the 
South.

A VOICE FBOM KENTUCKY. 

[In our first number we gave a few brief extracts from the speeches 
of individual members of the Virginia House of Delegates. Now we 
have the united expression of the Synod of Kentucky. They have 
issued an address to the Presbyterians of that State, which was pub- 
lished in a pamphlet form in Cincinnati, and afterwards reprinted in 
the 9th No. of the Emancipator, where it occupies nearly eioht col- 
umns. 'The authors of it are well acquainted with slavery, and they 
state facts, — general and undeniable facts, — which are falling under 
their daily observation. These facts, too, are stated of slavery in its 
mildest, kindest, and most " Christian" form.' Do ihey not fully cor 
roborate all that abolitionists have said ?] 

What Slavery is. 

Our system as established by law, arms the master with power to pre- ; 
vent his slave from worshiping God, according to the dictates of his' 
own conscience. The owner of human beings among us, rhay legal- ! 
ly restrain them from assembling to hear the instructions of divine) 
truth, or even from ever uniting their hearts and voices in social prayer, 
and praise to Him who created them. God alone is Lord over the: 
conscience. Yet our system, defrauding alike our Creator and our! 
slaves, confers upon men this prerogative of Deity. 

Cruelty may be carried to any extent, provided life he spared. Man-' 
jr'inn-, imprisonment, starvation, every species of torture way be: 
inflicted upon him and he has noredress. But, not content with thus, 
laying the body of the slave defenceless at the foot of the master, our \ 
system proceeds still further, and strips him in a great measure, of all j 
protection^ against the inhumanity of any other white man who may 
choose to maltreat him. The laws prohibit the evidence of a slave 
against a white man from being received in a court of justice. In de- ! 
scribing such a condition, we mav weil adopt the language of sacred 
writ — " Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standetli afar! 
off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. And 
the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment." 

Such is the essential character of our slavery. Without any crime 
on the part of its unfortunate subjects, they are deprived for life, and 
their posterity after them, of the right to property, of the rio'ht to 
liberty, and of the right to personal security. These odious- features 
are not the excrescences upon the system — they are the system it- 
self — they are its essential constituent partsr And can any man 
believe that such a thing as this is not sinful — that it is not hated by 
God — and ought not to be abhorred and abolished by man ? 
Effects of Slavery. 

Slavery deranges and ruins the moral machinery of man — it cuts 
the sinews of the soul — it extracts from human nature the salt that 
purifies and preserves it, and leayes it a corrupting mass of appetite 
and passion. 

Throughout our whole land, so far as we can learn, there is but one 
school in which, during the week, slaves can be taught. The light 
of three or four Sabbath schools is seen, glimmering through the 
darkness that covers the black population of a whole State. Here 
and there a family is found, where humanity and religion impel the 
master, mistress, or children, to the laborious task of private instruc- 
tion. But, after all, what is the utmost amount of instruction given 
to slaves i. Those who enjoy the most of it, are fed with but the 






Anti-Slavery Almanac, 



[1837 



crumbs of knowledge which fall from their master's table — they are 
clothed with the mere shreds and tatters of learning. 

The weakness and ignorance of their victims is the only safe foun- 
dation on which injustice and oppression can rest.. We may as soon 
expect to fetter the winds, seal up the clouds, or extinguish the fires 
of the volcano, as to prevent enlightened minds from recovering their 
natural condition of freedom. 

There are no houses of worship exclusively devoted to the colored 
population. The galleries of our own churches, which are set apart 
to their use, would not hold the tenth part of their numbers — and 
even these few seats are, in general, thinly occupied. So that, as a 
body, it is evident that our slaves do not enjoy the public ordinances 
of religion. Domestic means of grace are still more rare among them. J 

1'his system licenses and produces great cruelty. The law places j 
the whip in the hands of the master, and its use, provided he avoid! 
destroying life, is limited only by his own pleasure. There are, in j 
our laud, hundreds of thousands clothed with arbitrary powers over! 
those, whom they are educated to regard as their property, as the in-] 
siruments of their will, as creatures beneath their sympathy, devoid; 
of all the feelings which dignify humanity, and but one remove above! 
I cattle. Is it not certain that many of these hundreds of thousands 
jvvill inflict outrages on their despised dependents ? There are now 
i in our whole land two millions of human beings exposed, defenceless,: 
to every insult and every injury short of maiming or death, which 
their fellow-men may choose to inflict. They suffer all that ran be 
inflicted by wanton caprice, by grasping avarice, by brutal lust, by 
malignant spite, and by insane anger. Their happiness is the eport 
of every whim, and the prey of every passion, that may, occasionally 
or habitually, infest the master's bosom. If we could calculate the 
amount of wo endured by ill-treated slaves, it would overwhelm eve- 
rv compassionate heart, it would move even the obdurate to sympa- 
thy. Brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives 
tire torn asunder, and permitted to see each other no more. These 
acts are daily occurring in the midst of us. The shrieks and the ag- 
ony often witnessed on such occasions, proclaim with a trumpet 
tongue the iniquity and cruelty of our system. 

Our churches cannot be entirely pure, even from the grosser pollu- 
sions of slavery, until we are willing to pledge ourselves to the 
destruction of the whole system. The working of our system of sla- 
very diifuses a moral pestilence among its subjects, tending to wither 
and blight everj^thing that is naturally beautiful and good in the 
character of man. Can this system be tolerated without sin ? 
Its effects upon the m.asters. 

Power can never be held or exercised without moral injury to its 
possessor, unless its exercise be subject to responsibility, or unless it 
be held mainly for the good of its suhjects. not of its possessor. The 
lives of absolute monarchs furnish us with our most disgusting pic- 
tures of human depravity. Few, even of those who had been 
previously trained to self-control and virtue, have been able to with- 
stand the corrupting influence of unrestrained power. And the 
effect is, in some measure the same, where despotic authority is pos- 
sessed and exercised in a smaller sphere. 

We forbear to picture before you the consequences of that indolence 
and aversion to all manual occupations, which are necessarily engen- 



. 






l?37]

dered in youth, surrounded by a servile class, who are engaged in! 
these pursuits. These consequences you have all seen, and felt, and! 
deplored. Such are the evil effects to ourselves and our children of 
the system which we support. Thus are we made to eat of the bitter 
food which we pfepare for others, and drink of the poisoned cup 
which our own hands mingled — the sword with which we unthink- 
ingly destroy others is thus made to drink our own blood. 
Do the Scriptures sanction slavery ? 
It is often pleaded that in the Old Testament, God himself express- 
ly permitted his people to enslave the Canaanites. True ; fpi Gorl 
may punish any of the children of sin as he sees fit — He has a right 
to do so, and He alone has a right. He may commission eithei the 
winds, or the waves, or the pestilence, or their fellow-men, to work 
his purpose of vengeance upon any people. But man has no right to 
arrogate the -prerogative of the Almighty — he has no_itght, uncom- 
missioned by his Maker, either to enslave or destroy his fellow. God 
commissioned Saul to exterminate the Amalekites — could we plead 
this as an excuse for the massacre of an Indian tribe ? God express- 
ly directed his prophet Samuel to hew Agag in pieces — could any 
of us allege this as a ground for cutting down every man whom he 
considered as an enemy of Zion's King? How, then, can any man 
assert, that because God determined to punish the Canaanites, and 
used the Israelites as the executioners of his decree, we are at liber- 
ty to obey the dictates of our own avarice, and hold our fellow men 
in bondage ? 

We are told, again, that the apostles gave to Christian masters and 
Christian servants directions for the regulation of the ir mutual con- 
duct. True ; and these directions will be valuable while the world 
lasts — for so long, wo doubt not, will the relation of master and ser- 
vant exist. But how do such directions license the holding of slaves? 
The terms xohich the apostles use in giving these precepts, are the same 
terms which they would have used, had there been no slaves upon the 
earth. 

The precepts against fraud, oppression, pride, and cruelty, all cut 
directly through the heart of the slave system. Look back at the 
constituents and the effects of slavery, and ask yourselves, " Is not ev- 
ery one of these things directly at variance with the plainest 
commands of the gospel ?" The maintenance of this system breaks 
not one law of the Lord, or two laws — it violates the whole code — 
it leaves scarcely one precept unbroken. 

Con rluding Address. 
The hour is coming, in which tbe slave and his master must stand 
together before the tribunal of Gud — a God who judges righteously. 
Are you prepared to place yourselves before him who will decide 
upon your eternal destiny, and say that you have done justice to 
those whom you now hold in bondage ? Are you prepared to say, 
u as I have done unto these, so let it be done unto me — as I have 
showed mercy, so let me receive mercy at the hands of my judge ? 
Anticipate, we beseech you, the feelings and decision of that great 
day which is fast hastening on — try yourselves now, as God will 
then try you. " What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, 
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God ? " Are you " do- 
ing justly," while you retain your fellow men in hopeless bondage ? 
Are you " loving mercy," while you are supporting a system that^de- 



36 



Anti-Slavery Almanac. 



1837 



grades and bratalizes beings whom God created in his own image ? 
These are solemn questions. Let reason answer them ; and let 
conscience decide your future course. 

JOHN BROWN, Chairman. 

John C. Young, Secretary. 

We have thus given a very few of the conclusions to which the 
members of the Kentucky synod have arrived, after personal observa- 
tion, and mature reflection, upon the iniquitous system. Can any 
one have the presumption to say that they have not been influenced in 
preparing this address by the labors of jYe/son. Bir.ncy, Thovie, and 
the oth ,x . immediate abolitionists of Kentucky and vicinity? No one 
can imagine this. Let us then set up a standard to whic 1 the con- 
scientious inhabitants of the slave-holding States may look, and 
which may encourage their hearts in undertaking, and strengthen 
their hands, in carrying forward an uncompromising warfare with this 
giant sin. Will the inhabitants of New-England wait to be taught 
lessons of freedom by the citizens of slave-holding Kentucky ? What 
answer shal4 we give ~vvhen the long-suffering of God is exhausted, 
and the vials of his v rath are poured out, and we are called to answer 
the dread inquiry, why did you not warn your brethren of their guilt 
and danger? Why did you resist and throw obstacles in the way of 
those who were seeking to obey the command of Jehovah, " Thou 
shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke 
thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him? " Soon you will be called 
to give your reply. Is it ready ? 

ANECDOTES.. 

t: Every body at the North is opposed to Slavery." 
When soliciting subscribers to a petition for the abolition of slavery 
in the District of Columbia, a short time ago, I called on a man who 
keeps a store within five rods of the office where this Almanac is 
printed, and asked him if he would give me his name. He replied in 
a very angry manner, that 1 was meddling with what was none of my 
business; and, said he, "if they don't let this subject alone, they'll 
get cold lead into 'em, that I can tell 'em." 

I was once conversing with a Sabbath school teacher of Boston on 
the subject of slavery and colonization. In the course of my re- 
marks, I told him that the Colonization Society did not propose to do 
anything for the present generation of slaves, and that, allowing it to 
be able to accomplish all it could possibly promise, or all its warmest 
friends could expect, still ten generations must live and die in slavery. 
Ten generations must come upon the stage to drag out a life of deg- 
radation, shame, and misery. Ten generations must pass down to the 
gloomy ffrave, ignorant of all that is beyond it. T was proceeding 
with my~picture° when he interrupted me by saying, " Better that ten 
hundred [generations] should, thjin that they should be set free 
here ! ! ! " I was so shocked by this speech, that I made no reply. 

During the summer of 1825, I made a short journey in New- 
Hampshire. Stopping for a short time in the village of Drewsville, I 
commenced distributing anti-slavery publications, as my custom was. 
Soon a considerable number of farmers and mechanics gathered round

me, when a man near me called to a farmer who just then drove up 
in his wagon, and asked him if he wanted some anti-slavery tracts 
" No," said he, "I don't want 'em, and the folks that's distributing 
them ought to be hung." I told him he eould commence operations 
on the spot, if he cho^e. He said it wouldn't exactly do to hang me 
there, but, he added in no very friendly manner, " If I had you at the 
South, I'ld hang you." 



A lady of Canaan, soon after the Academy had been removed from 
that place, told me that those engaged in removing it were heartily 
opposed to slavery, and thai they entertained no feelings of hostility 
to the colored race ; and this was the way most of the rioters talked. 
As a manifestation of their kind feelings, at the time three of the 
young men left the place in a wagon, a number of the inhabitants 
placed ji cannon by the side of the road where they must pass, and 
when they came "to the spot, discharged it under the horse's feet, 
thereby exposing the young men in the wagon to imminent peril of 
their lives. 

' Men high in authority, hive attempted to justify the glaring out 
rage op m the property of a corporati >n which was committed upon 
the 10th of August, in Canxm, N. II., by saying that a majority of 
the subscribers to the institution were engaged in its removal. The 
fact in the case is this. The propeity removed cost $954, of whicli 
those engaged in removing the building, subscribed $60, only one 
Uurth of which they had paid in. 

A GOOD STORY — TN TWO PAHT.^. 

Mr. W. a gentleman from Ohio, as lie was travelling in Kentucky, 
oflen conversed with the stave-holders about the condition of iheir 
slaves. A Kentdckian once told him that the slaves were contented 
with their condition, and all the most intelligent of them knew that 
they \v>t<> better off than they would be if they were free. Mi W. 
doubted the truth of the statement, but the Kentdckian persisted in 
affirming its correctness, and related the following story : — 

"A neighbor of mine," said he, "had a very likely, valuable slave, who 
contrived to get away about six mm;hs a^o, and escaped to Canada. 
Me stayed there three months, and then became so discontented that 
he caused a letter to be written to his former master, in which he said 
he had got enough of freedom, and that if he would send for him he 
would return. The master went and got his slave, who was very 
glad to come back with him, and he has been faithfully and industri- 
ously at work ever since. He is now effectually cured of his itch for 
liberty, and wouldn't have his freedom on any terms, for he knows he 
is better off in slavery than he would be if ho was free." Mr. W. did 
not presume to deny the statement, and he was completely at a loss 
for an answer. He began to fear that negroes were as stupid as their 
slanderers at the north — represent them to be. He allowed the slave- 
holder to triumph, and left him to enjoy his victory. 
PART II. • 

A few weeks afterwards Mr. W. was in Cincinnati, and there he 
happened to fall in company with a colored man who seemed much 
pleased with something which had just happened. Mr. W. begged 
to know what it was. The colored man said he had just heard an 
xcellent story, and proceeded to give the history of the slave men-

tmned abuve,as tar as the Keniuckian iiad related it. A few months- 
after the slave's return to Kentucky there was a camp meeting several 
miles from where his master lived. The slave came to him one Sat- 
urday afternoon, and asked if he might go to the " big meeting" and 
stay till Monday morning. His master readily granted his petition, 
and, without waiting for the slave's farther request, asked him if 
Nelly (his wife) would not like 1o go with him. " O yes, massa,'" 
said the slave, " she like very much to go; if massa willing." "Well. 
then," said the master, " if she goes, you know you must have thf 
cart and take the children along with you." "O yes, massa, we won'l 
leave the children at home to plague missee." They accordingly took 
the cart for the man and his children, and their mistress offering to 
let Neily have the pony to ride on, — they soon started off to go to the 
"big meeting ." By this lime the reader, if he has a spark of ingenu- 
ity or love of liberty akout him, has guessed at the conclusion I will 
jonly add that the man and his family, having got safe to Canada, he 
(there, with \i\sfrre wife and children, held a meeting, '' big" with grat- 
jitude and joy. The slave-holder was so much more stupid than the 
jslave,that he never suspected his plan till it was too lale to catch him. 



THE SLAVE FATHER. 

The following article contains a portion of the history of Bimnrr 
Washington, as the editor heard it from his own mouth. Mr. Wash- 
ington is a venerable looking man, with a complexion not very dark, 
quite intelligent for a man who can neither read nor write, and he ha- 
i testimonials of his moral character, which must convince the most 
•incredulous that his statements are entitled to implicit confidence 
'Any one who hasjhsard him, however, and seen the tears gush forth 
ias he mentioned the cruel separation, would not require any testimo 
jnials to convince him that the father's relation was the simple truth. 
Now when the dtiy's long toil was clone, 

He sought his humble cot, 
Where his loved wife s.tvi prattling son, 

Still cheered his gloomy tot. 
His cup of grief was not yet (5 lied ; 

■Some drops of joy were hft. 
While of his wife and smiling child, 

He was .not yet bereft. 
That much loved boy still came to meet 

fiis father's homeward tread, 
And hastily prepared a seat, 

Where their mean hoard was spread. 
Tho father, fixing on his son, 

His keen .inquiring eye, 
Saw that some grief, to him unknown, 

Caused many a bitter sigh 
The artl 'ss hov soon frankly told 

What filled his breast with fear j 
Ho dreaded lest he should be sold 

Far from his father dear. 

"Just now a constable," said he, 

L L Wits* rod and line came in, 
"And carefully he measured me, 

" And stripped me to my skin. 
" And as he fell me o'er and o'er, 

»' I thought, with aiony, 
"That tliey would sell me where ro more 

" Mv father I might s<n> " 



"O, no, my son," the father cried, 

•' It surely can't be so ; 
"They wilt not tear yo'i from my side, 

"They're not so bad, I know." 
Alns ! this hope soon h;lt his breast; 

The driver came next day; — 
For the boy was sold, as he hid guessed, — 

And they drove the child away. 
The father runs, with idling heart, 

While tears roll down his cheek, 
To kiss his child once ere they part, 

And one f.rewell to speak. 
"They kicked me liack," the, father spake- 

As his tale fffgriel he told, 
And then, as if his heart would break, 

The tears flowed uncontrolled. 
"I never saw that child ;.gain," 

At length he feebly spoke, 
" My bursting heart "seemed rent in twain

FOURTH OF JULY, 

On this memorable day, our ears will be greeted, and our vanity 
flattered, by glowing descriptions of the peace, happiness, prosperity, 
iiberty, intelligence, and virtue of this "purest of republics," 
'* The queen of the world, and the child of the skies." 

The following are extracts from some of the 4th of July addresses, 
which have been delivered in years past. 

" The means of knowledge, and of literature, are everywhere diffused; 
we have the religion of nature systematized by revelation ; our consti- 
tutions and our laws have no parallel in the history of men." — Wm. 
Sullivan, Boston, 1803. 

"You have a government deservedly celebrated, as "giving the 
sanctions of the law to the precepts of reason," presenting, instead of 
the rank luxuriance of natural licentiousness, the corrected sweets ot 
civil liberty." — Phillips, Boston, 1794. 

" They [the Revolutionary patriots] disdained an inconsistency of 
character ; they presented the world with a glorious example, by ef- 
fecting their own emancipation. . . . That God never created ahuman 
being to be a slave, was, in their opinion, an axiom so self-evident, 
that it would have been blasphemy to have deemed it problematical. 

" Enlightened, honest, and independent, the citizens of our populous 
towns, the inhabitants of our villages and hamlets, act, reason, and de- 
termine for themselves on subjects of the greatest moment, with such 
propriety, that the voice of the American people may, with justice, be 
termed the voice of God. . . America, the birth-place ofliberty, — the 
asylum of the oppressed, — presents to the world an object for admira- 
tion, to superior beings, a subject for applause." — John Lathrop Jr. 
Boston, 179G. — How just the compliment: Behold the proof! 

SPIRIT OF SLAVERY. 
Copy of a Resolution passed 'it an Anti-Abolition Meeting in Virginia. 

" Resolved, That we will sustain all Postmasters in detaining and 
publicly destroying all abolition papers which may arrive at their re- 
spective offices; and that all those who refuse to do it, be considered 
accomplices of the crime, and subject to popular indignation, and ab- 
solute personal peril." Freemen of the North, would you have this 
spirit perpetual and universal? If so, uphold slavery. 

But how are Postmasters to ascertain what are abolition papers ? 
Perhaps the following extract from the Post Office law, will throw 
some light on the subject. 

" If any person, employed in any department of the Post Office, shall 
improperly detain, delay, embezzle, or destroy any newspaper, or shall 
permit any other person to do the like, or shall open any mail or pack- 
et of newspapers not directed to the office where he is employed, such 
offender shall, on conviction thereof, forfeit a sum, not exceeding fifty 
dollars, for every such offence." 

Mem. " His wicked device which he [Hainan] devised against the 
Jews, should return upon his own head." A Georgia paper, of Feb., 
1836. advertises a reward, for the recovery of $5000 , which were mailed 
at Savannah, but never received. Some Postmaster, doubtless, feared 
there was something " incendiary " about the billsand pocketed them, 
that the " commonwealth might receive no detriment." If, in his zeal 
for the preservation of " the peace and dignity of the State," he made 
i slight mistake, slave holders will have the ennd^r to excuse it.

PRODUCE OF SLAVE LABOR, No. II.— By C. Stuart. 
The Lord will enter into judgment tcith the ancients of his people, and 

with the princes thereof , for the spoil of the poor is in your 

houses. — Is. 3 : 14. 

Is using slave produce a sin ? What is slave produce ? 

It is produce got by using our neighbor's labor without wages. 

Thus saith the Lord, " Woe unto him that buildeth his house by 
unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong — that useth his neigh- 
bor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work.— Jer. 
22: 1.3. And again, " Behold the hire of the laborers who have 
reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth! 
and the cries of them that have reaped, are entered into the ears of the 
Lord of Sabaoth." — James, 5: 4. 

What right has the slave-holder to the produce thus obtained ? 

The right of the strongest. 

Is the right of the strongest a religious, or moral, orequitable right? 

No ; — it is simply the right of force — the right of the tiger amongst 
quadrupeds, and of tyrants and robbers amongst men. The law of 
God prohibits it. Justice foi bids it. Love bleed* over it. Humanity, 
virtue, and innocence perish wherever it prevails. 

What right can the master communicate in selling such produce ? 

The right which he himself possesses, and none other — that is, the 
right of the strongest ; or, in other words, the right of the tiger, the 
robber, and the tyrant. 

What rioht is obtained by purchasing slave produce ? 

The right of the vender ; that is, the right of force, and none other ! 

But does not the law sanction slavery? 

It does what it can to sanction slavery ; but inferior laws never can 
cancel superior laws. The laws or rules of a family cannot annul the 
laws of a parish ; nor the laws of a parish, those of a city; nor the 
laws of a city, those of a county ; nor thelaws of a county, those of a 
State ; nor the laws of the State, those of the Union; nor the lawb 
of the Union, the laws of God ! Wickedness, when sustained by 
law, only becomes the more atrocious; and those who take advantage 
of wicked laws to commit wickedness, show plainly, that it is not the 
holy, just, and 'good law of God which they love in that particular 
but the partial, proud and selfish laws of men. 

Purchasing and using slave produce, therefore, is purchasing and 
using articles obtained by force and fraud — articles, to which those 
who sold them had no right, and could communicate to you. no 
right, but the right of the tyrant, and the robber; a nefarious right, 
aggravated, not sanctioned, by the mischief-making laws which guar- 
antee it; and it is clearly a sin of no common grade, to administer to 
robbery aud oppression, under the shelter of nefarious laws — to ex- 
cuse and defend sin, by the very circumstance w>.ich aggravates the 
miseries that flow from it. 

But we are told, " Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, cat, asking 
no questions, for conscience's sake. — 1 Cor. 10 : 25. 

Would you eat arsenic, becau.se it was sold in the shambles ? Cer- 
tainly not. Would you buy your neighbor's coat, knowing it to be s'.o- 
hn, because it was sold in the shambles "? Certainly not. The mere 
fact, therefore, that a thing is sold in the shambles, evidently does not 
render it right either to eat <^r to buy it. But what is the meaning, 






18^7]

then of the injunction ? Clearly this ; that when we know of no reason 
against eating or buying an article sold in the market, we ought not 
to perplex ourselves or others with fastidious quest : ons. But when 
we hav*; reason to apprehend, that there is poison there — either phys- 
ical -or moral — that the article has been obtained by force and fraud — 
that the vender has no right, and can communicate, no right to it, 
except the right of the tyrant and the robber, and that no laws sus- 
tain it, except laws which are the bane of society and the disgrace of 
human nature :— When in tact, generally speaking, we need a&k no 
questions, since we already know the selfish, and cruel process, by 
which that article has been wrung out of the unrequited toil of the 
oppressed and poor; icho would dare implicate God in the imputation 
of commanding or sanctioning, such a purchase? or if God had sanc- 
tioned such a purchase, where could we find a limit for villuny ? 

We are happy to inform ihe American public that those goods 
which are usually wrung out from the forced and unpaid labor of 
slaves, may be had, free from contamination, at ihe store of Simeon P 
Adams, 120, Courtst., Boston, and of Charles Collins, Franklin Square,

Here is a picture of two little sisters. They l«>ve each other very 
much. Slave-holders sometimes tear such little children away from 
fcheir parents, and sell them to ciuel men who will never let them see 
their mothers while they live. When you see your kind mother smile 
sweetly upon you, as you are engaged in your sport6, or when she 
gives you the parting kiss, as you go to your quiet bed, O think of the 
hapless slave mother, who is in constant alarm, lest the kidnapper 
should seize her darling babe. When you knrel down at night, pray 
far the helpless hlave child, and its trembling mother. 



THE AFFECTIONATE SISTER. 

There was once a little colored gill in Boston who used often to 
come into a house in Hancock street, to see if there were any broken 
victuals left, wbich she might carry home to her mother and brother. 
One day when she was in the kitchen, the mistress of the house 
brought out a little piece of oudding, and told her she had better eat 
it there. "No 1 thank you/' said *he, " I would much rather givo my 
brother half of it than to eat it alone." 




Jane — What is thai the picture of, Miss Paul ? 
Miss P — It represents what took place ens morning when three 
|j little children were coming to my school. The largest child in the 
picture, an interesting hoy about seven yeas s of age, on entering 
school one o\y. came tri me and said. " Miss Paul, a woman in the 
street gave Frederick and Amelia (his brother and a little girl who 
came to school with him) each an apple, but ! took them both from 
them and put them in the cast.'' " Why did you take them from 



the 



said 



Because they did not belong to the woman," said 



he. " She took Ihem out of a cart that stood in the street, and after 
she hud given them to us > he ran a, wag, and I knew she had broken 
the eighth commandment." I then asked him what it was? "Thou 
shalt not steal," said he, with earnestness. The children to whom 
the apples were given lining considerably younger than he was, J 
asked him if they did not cry when he took them from them ? "No,'" 
said lie, '• / told them th<y icere si;, icn." He spoke this as if he thought 
it a sufficient reason why they should give ihem up. This was more 
than 1 expected from one so young, and I eould only clasp him to n:-y 
bosom, and imprint a kiss on his forehead, breathing a wish that those 
who scruple not to buy and sell innocent men, women and children. 
knowing thnn to have br.tn stolen, would learn a lesson from the exam- 
ple of this little colored b h$ 

In the picture you seethe largest boy throwing back the apple given 
to him, while the others hold apples in their h-nds. 

Slave-holders, and many who are not slave-holders, often tell us we 
cannot prove that it is wicked to hold skives. 1 guess that if that wo- 
man had taken all the apples, and every thing else the man had, and 
the man hinisrlf. the little boy, ami every other honest person would 
say at once that she was very wicked, and had done a great deal that 
was forbidden in the eighth commandment.

Caro'ine What is that woman String, uncle ? 

Mr. S. She has an axe in her hand, with which she is kil 
little children'. 

Of What made hor hate them so ? What had they done to her 

Mi S. She did n't hate them, my dear. 

Car. I should think she did. What, ttid she kill them for ? 

Mr. S. I will tell you. She was a slave. She lived in the state of 
Missouri, a state seven times as large as Massachusetts, and a thousan 
| miles from here. Those are her own little children, and she loved them 
I very much. When she came home at night, from hor day's hard la- 
bor, she always hastened to meet hor children It made her feel happy 
and foro-et her wretched lot, when she saw them run smiling to meet 
her, and hold out thoir little hand to take hold of hers, as you do 
when your lather comes home. 

Car. My mother lives me, too, hut 3' e would n't kill me. 

Mr. S You ought to thank G^d that your mother is not a sla\-e 

One night when that woman came homo, she found that her dear 
boys had been sold to a man who was going to carry them more than 
j six hundred miles off, to a place where 1 hey would have t<> woik un 
der a driver's lash, and where she could never see them again. I can- 
not tell you how bad she felt. She Felt much worse than your mother 
would, if a stone should fall on you and kill you. Tho children did 
| not know what was going to be done to them, and they laid dun and 
! slept quietly in their bed of straw, clasped in each other's ami3. 

Car. Didn't their mother sleep with them ? 

Mr. S. The mother couldn't sleep when her child ten were n-oing to 
be carried off. The man who bought them, did not think it safe to let 
her be where she could <ret at them, to take them away. So they lmd 
her chained in a shed Rear the house. As she lay there, and thought 
of the toil, and stripes and misery her children must endure, she 
thought she would rather see them both dea«1 and put in the ground 
She tried hard to get loose from her chain, and after some time she

ot it off from her hands and feet. Slit? then took an axe and. went to 
the place where her boys were, and killed them. 

Cur. What did the slave-driver do to her, the next morning? 

Mr. S She was alraid of his cruelty, and she killed herself. 

L cannot tell you how much torment a mother must suffer, before 
he would kill her own children. You can judge from this what sla- 
very is The mother, who had tried it, preferred death. 

Car. Is it not wicked to kill ? 

Mr. S. Yes ; but this poor woman had not been allowed to read in 
Uie Bible, and learn that it was wicked. She did what she thought 
was best for herseif and children. 



IMITATION OF MRS. UAHBAULD'S SEASONS.— NO. II. 
Who is this, with smiling face and rapid step, that is approaching 
from the east ? The shouts of eight hundred thousand ransomed cap- 
tives announce her approach. Light and truth go before her: peace 

nd plenty follow in her path. In one hand she brings a key to un- 
lock the prison doors: in the other she bears the open volume of the 
word of life. All the lovers of mercy rejoice when they see her. A 
smile of hope lights up the dark face of the slave. The proud oppressors 
jf their race tremble at her coming. The whip falls from their feeble 
rrasp. The hard hearts, which have set at naught the law of God, 
ind defied the thunderbolts of the Almighty, are beginning to soften. 
They see her steady progress, and they find it in vain to oppose her. 
Churches and. schools spring up around her. The ground on which 
die treads assumes new verdure and beauty. She builds again ' the old 
waste places.' The land which had been gloomy and desolate, be- 
comes ' as a watered garden,' and ' as a spring of water, whose, waters 
tail not.' Gloomy forebodings, and dismal leais flee, away, when she 
irnves. Men arc no longer troubled with apprehensions of rebellion 
and revolt. They cease to hear the step of an assassin in every rust- 
ling leaf. Nor do they see threats of murder and revenge in every 

olored face. She seats herself in the 'negro's cot.' and spreads 

heerfulness and contentment around his fireside. Youths and maid- 
ens of America, do you see her approaching us ? Can you tell me her 
name ? 



ARE WE PRODUCING ANY EFFECT AT THE SOUTH? 

A worthy gentleman, who resided some time in North Carolina, re- 
lates that he has succeeded in turning the attention of many persons 
'.here to the wickedness of slavery. He mentioned the case of one- 
young woman, who was heir to his inheritance of 40 slaves, and who 
was anxious to give them'their liberty She commissioned our in- 
formant to find places for them at the North, and promised to send 
ill on as soon as places were found for E.hetn. 

But here the despiser of God's image [in a colored man] will say. 
• See how the abolitionists are filling our northern cities with niggers.' 
Rut stop, sir, please to direct your wrath, not against abolitionists, but 
against those laws which forbid emancipation at home. 

And heie, Mr. Gradualist, I should like to say a word to you. You 
see by this, that if the slaves are gradually set free, they must leave 
the place where they are, (and will be likely to go to the north.) that 
they may not interfere with the slavery which remains. But if they 
ire all set free at once, they may continue where they are.

OBJECTION CONSIDERED. 

Obj. K The. SI aces arc contented in Slavery " 

Contented in slavery ! and are tliey men ? What deadly magic has 
been practiced upon them ? What soul-killing compound, mingled 
amidst the sulphureous stench of the bottomless pit has been adminis- 
tered to them? Through what brutifying process have they been com- 
pelled to piss, thus to destroy ever}' upward aspiration, every noble 
principle 1 of the human soul ? If this statement is correct, then tyranny 
has indeed reached its climax : the woik of desolation is complete. 

Imagine, for a moment, that a. dear brother of yours, born beneath 
the same roof, nurtured by the same affectionate mother, the sharer of 
your juvenile sports, and the soother of your little griefs, had been 
stolen from your peaceful fireside, and carried to drag out a {lying life 
on the barbarous shores of Algiers. Imagine, further, that a man 
who had just arrived from that distant land, should approach your 
dwelling. With what eagerness would you inquire for your long-lost 
brother. Flow earnestly would you ask if he had seen him. With 
what anxiety would you seek to know whether he thought of those 
iie left at homo. " No ;*' the man would answer, " he seemed not to 
think at all of his home or his native land." " But, did nt he wish to 
obtain h s freedom - 1 " you would ask. " ^o ;" he would again reply, 
• ; lie was contented in slavery, and though our vessel lay by the 
wa.ler-side, and he might easily come on board, he chose to remain 
where lie was/ 1 With what a thrill of horror would you receive 
this announcement ! Then, you would exclaim, has cruelly done its 
perfect work. You would need no one t<> inform you that if the 
statement were correct, he most be degraded indeed. Tim truth 
would fh-h upfm your mind that he had become an. idiot. 

You know, however, that the. slaves are Not contented ; else, why 
those nightly patrols, that continual alarm, those cautious and severe 
restrictions, which show that the masters know they are discontented ? 
And why are southern papers filled with advertisements for runaways ? 



O.N EI DA INSTITUTE. 

In the Oneida Institute, at Whitesboro', near Utica, manual and t 
htniint-t] labor are united. To enter tills institution, the student, with i 
| trustworthy testimonials, of good mental and mural character, is 
(required to sustain an examination in whatever is necessary to qualify i 
j the teacher of a common English school for his office, and in the I 
Greek text of Matthew's Gospel. To the course of study then to be 
pursued, occupying four years of forty weeks each, belong the Greek 
and Hebrew Scriptures, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Survey- 
ing, Navigation, Natural Phil ><ophy, Astronomy, Chemistry, Anato- 
my, Natural Pujilojouhy, Evidences of Christianity, Butler's Analogy, 
Mental and Mm*al Philosophy, Logic and Rhetoric, Science of Gov- 
ernment, and Political Economy "Every year begins with the second 
Thursday in February. The winter vacation occupies tweUe weeks. 
The results of his manual labor will nearly pay the boaid bill of each 
student. Tuition, room-rent, and contingent bills amount to thirty 
dollars a year. Students are admitted irrespective of color. In the 
preparatory department, the advantages commonly afforded at an 
American- Academy, may be secured. Application for admission to 
the Oneida Institute should be made to Rev. Beriah Green, the
