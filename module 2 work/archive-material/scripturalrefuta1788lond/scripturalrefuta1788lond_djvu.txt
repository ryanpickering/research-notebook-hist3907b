LETTER I, 

A HAVE perufed with fome degree of 
attention, the very extraordinary pam- 
phlet which you lately fent me, intitled, 

" Scriptural Kefearches on the licitness 
of the Slave Tirade, by the Rev. Raymiind 
Harris ;'' m which the author has endea- 
voured to fliew ** its coiiforfnify with the 
principles of natural and revealed religion, 
as delineated in the facred writings of th^ 
%pord of God'^ 



Although 



[ 2 ] 

Although I have not that high opiruoii 
of the ftate of improvement, in this age 
and country, which many perfons profefs 
to entertain, yet I own I could not avoid 
being farprifed, that either the one or the 
pther, fhould have been iniulted by the 
publication of a work, which, if its 
dangerous and dellrudrive 'principles were 
admitted in their full extent, would 
fhake the foundations of fociety, and eilab- 
lifh, by the JanBicn of divine autho7^ity^ 
every variety of oppreilionj and' every 

cies of guilt. 



The {hort account you gave me of the 
charad:er and profellion of the author, 
operated however as a fort of comment on 
his work. The unnatural attachment to 
ilavery—- the averiion and dread of the in- 
terference of reafon and common fenfe-— 
|he artful and fubtle pofitions whict| 
^l^ the foundation of his work, appear 



C 3 ] 

totally irreconcileable to the characfler of 
an Englijfjman, but are perfedly confiflent 
with that of a Spanifi Jefuit, 

I muft not, however^ charge the Rev* 
Raymund Harris, with being the iiril 
who has openly attempted the jaflifica- 
tion of moral guilt, from the books of 
the old and new teftament. So long ago 
as the beginning of the 15th century^ 
one yohn Petit^ a doctor of the church 
in France, not only publicly juflified the 
murder of the Duke of Orleans^ by the 
Duke of Burgundy, but took occalion, at 
the fame time, to alTert the general /f- 
gality (or, as it is now exprelTed^ the //- 
citnefs) of homicide, which he founded 
on the example of all the murders men- 
tioned in the old teflament> by making 
that a rule of conduB, which was only in- 
troduced as a mere htfiorical narrative, 

B 2 As 



E 4 1 

As I have at prefent a little leifure, I 
think I cannot employ it to better pur- 
pofe, than in Gripping the mafk from this 
concealed enemy of order and religion, 
and expofing him to the world in his 
proper colours. But before I enter on 
the examination of his work, it may not 
be improper to premife, that I iliall con- 
fine myfelf to the mode of proof he has 
himfelf prefcribed -, viz. to that derived 
from the authority of the facred writings 
only — not thinking it in any degree ne- 
cefTary in the refutation of his work, to 
refort to thofe more general arguments 
which are derived from the nature of 
man, and the univerfal principles of truth 
andjuflice, as implanted in the human 
mind, by the immediate hand of its great 
author -, nor availing myfelf of an objec- 
tion, which might be reafonably made, 
viz. That in difcuffing a matter of right 
between the Europeans and the Africans, 

an 



[ 5 ] 

an appeal is made to an authority, which 
one of the parties only acknowledges as 
legitimate. 

But though I fhall confine myfelf to 
the proofs and authorities deduced from 
the facred writings, yet I cannot fo far 
coincide with Mr, H's wifh, as entirely 
to diveft myfelf of '' the f canty light of 
tnere human reafon andfenfe^'' which, not- 
withflanding the opprobium thrown upon 
it by Mr. H. in his preface, I cannot 
help thinking, is in fome degree neceifary, 
to enable us to underftand thofc writings. 
Mr. H. indeed afterwards informs us, 
that he has prefixed to the whole of his 
work, a few polltions or data, which he 
trufls will be found unqueftionably true, 
and exaBly confornmhk to found reafon-, 
and thus, whilfl in one breath he im- 
peaches the authority of this ultimate 

judge 



r 6 3 

judge of truth, in the next he admits 11 
to queftion his firfl principles. 

With this permiffion then, I ihall, in the 
prefent letter, take the liberty of ftating 
a few of his data, (which are twelve 
in number) and trying whether they are 
confiftent with found reafon or not 5 in 
which I fhall endeavour to be as concife 
as the nature of the fubjecft will admit* 

His I fl and 2d pofitions are, 

** ^hat the volume of the facred 
*' writings f commonly called the Hol^ 
" Bible, comprehending both the Old 
'' and New 'Tejlaments, contains the 
** unerring dectjions of the word of 
" God* That thefe decifons are 
** of equal authority in both th^ 
*' T^eflaments ; and that that au- 
** thority is the ejfential veracity of 
** God^ who is truth itfelf 

Now 



C 7 ] 

. Mow if w€ for a moment apply to thefe 
politions the touchftone of human reafon^ 
we {h:i\\ find that fome of theni are fun- 
damentally falfe; and that all of them are 
to be underilood ¥/ith many rellridions 
^nd exceptions. That the Old and New 
Teflaments contain the unerring decilions 
of God, where God has exprefsly given, 
them to us as his decifions, every Chrif- 
tian^ will readily admit ; but it is obvious, 
that the far greater part of the Old and 
New Teiliament, confifls, not of decifions. 
hut of m^re hiflorical ficis, fome of them 
affording inftance§ of a virtuous, and 
others of a vicious condud:. That other 
parts of the fcriptures, even where fuch 
decifions are found, are not of general 
ufe, but are applicable only to particular 
times, or to a particular people. That it is 
not true that the decifions of the Old and 
New Teflament are of equal authority, 
for that the former is always controlled 



[ 8 ] 

by the latter; which has totally abro- 
gated many parts of the Mofaic law, and 
made ah elTential difference, not only in 
the ritual, but in the moral duties in- 
joined by the Old Teilament, as I fhall 
hereafter have occafion to iliew more at 
large. 

The elTence of his four next poiitions 
is, T!hat whatever is declared to be 
right or wrong in the fcriptures^ is fo in its 
nature, and cannot be quejiioned without 
great prefumption ; but mujl be ajfented to 
without refervCy however contrary it may 
be to the opinions of men for any length of 
time. But thefe pofitions are alfo laid 
down in a form, much too general to be 
admitted by the profefTors of any reli^ 
gion, except that in which the reverend 
author was educated. It will readily be 
granted, that whenever the fcriptures have 
decided on gqneral principles of right and 

wrongs 



[ 9 ] 

Wrong, fuch decifions are unerring $ 
but it muft alfo be granted, that when, 
thofe decifions have a reference to the 
fituation of a particular perfon> or a par- 
ticular nation, they ought not to be arbi- 
trarily and indifcriminately applied to other 
perfons, or other nations : And if from 
the powers given to the Jews over their 
enemies, the permiffion of certain a(5ts in 
particular cafes, and the exiflence of cer- 
tain cufloms amongfl them, we were to 
infer a right in ourfelves, to imitate their 
adiions, and pradife their cuftoms, when- 
ever we thought there was a limilarity in 
our fituation, the book of the Old Tefta- 
ment might be converted into a general 
'^voucher for the licitnefs of almoft every 
crime, and every enormity, whether na- 
tional or individual. 

Mr. H. proceeds in his 5;th datum to 
ftate, ** l^hat if one or more decifions of 
C ** the 



[ 10 ] 



the written word of God give a 
pofitive Jan5iion to the intrinjic 
licitnejs of any human purfuif, for 
injiance, the blave Trade, whoever 
profejfes to believe the incontro- 
vertible veracity of the written 
word of God effentially incompati- 
ble with the leaf degree of injuftice, 
mufl confequently believe the pur- 
fmt itfelf to be intrinfcally jiiji and 
lawful in the JiriSleJl fenfe of the 
word." ■ 



From this pofition then it would feem 
that all adions which have, under the 
Jewilli difpenfation, been praftifedby the 
fandtion of divine authority, are intrinfi- 
cally and univerfally right, and may be 
pradtifed by all mankind,, in all future 
times, not only without guilt, but with 
the ftridefl virtue and propriety; and this 
moil; extenfive rule is founded on a pre- 

fumption. 



[ n ] 

fumption, that what Gad has, on one 
occafion, declared to be right, miift alfo 
be right on all other occalions, without 
any attention to the particular circum- 
fiances of each. Suppofing this poiition 
to be once granted, it is doubtful whether 
the depravity of man could commit a 
crime for which Mr. H. would not, from 
the facred writings, extract a better apo- 
logy than he has already done for the 
Slave Trade. Thus, for inflance, if any 
man doubted of the inherent licitnefs of 

INCEST, 

It would be eafy for Mr. Harris to point 
out the example of the daughters of 
Lot, who each of them conceived by 
their father,* wh'#:h tranfadion, fa far 
from being reprefented as criminal, not 
only palfes free from the lead Hiadow of 
j[:€prehenfion, but the offspring of this in- 
C 2 tercourfe. 

Gen. c, xix. v. 30. 



tercourfe, became the founders of two 
powerful nations. Jacob's marrying 
two fifters,* by each of whom he had 
children, and who pur chafed of each 
Other his favorSj-f- would be an exprefs 
authority. Were a doubt ftill entertained 
of the licitnefs of the crime, Mr. Ho 
might refer to the general laws of the. 
Jews, by which the furviving brother 
was commanded to go in unto his 
brother's wife, and marry her, an4 
raife up feed to his brother; and 
might point out an infiance where a 
refufal to comply wdth this injunc--. 
tion, brought down' upon the offender 
the immediate vengeance of God. J Mr, 
H. might then advert to the flate of man- 
kind in the firfl age of the Vv^orld, when 
the commillion of this crime was not only 
excufable, but indifpenfibly necelTary tQ 
the prefervation of the fpecies, and thus 

the 

* Gen. c. xxix. f Gen. c. xxx. v. ij.

[ «3 3 

the inherent licitnefs of this hemous 
pfFence would he much more fatisfa(fto- 
rily proved than the lawful nature of the 
African Slave Trade, notwithftanding the 
indefatigable labour which Mr. H. has 
beftowed upon it« 

FRAUD. 

Should any perfon entertain fcruples of 
confcience, v^^ith refpec^ to the lawfulnefs 
of defrauding his neighbour, let him a- 
dopt Mr. H's pofition, and open the Old 
Teftament. He will there find that the 
patriarch Jacob, the immediate founder 
and ftock of the Jewifh nation^ under 
pretence of a purchafe, defrauded his bro- 
ther Efau of his birth right ;* and in 
order to compleat this firil piece of trea- 
chery, was induced, by a contrivance of 
the moil artful nature, to obtain from 
}|is father Ifaac, the bleffing of the firfl 

born^ 

. ^ I Qex\, c. xxy, v, 39= 



[ H ] 

born, to the wrong and prejudice of his 
elder brother. Should he ftill remain 
doubtful, he may turn to another incident 
in the life of the fame patriarch, related 
at large Gen, c. 30, v. 25. in which he 
will find a flratagem put in execution by- 
Jacob to defraud Laban, his father-in- 
law, which, according to his pofition, 
will juftify the inherent licitnefs of cheat- 
ing beyond the fhadow of contradid:ion. 
To thefe authentic fads, which were the 
foundation of Jacob's greatnefs, he may add 
the authorities that may be deduced from 
Ex.c,xi,v.2.andc.xii,v. 35. where the I f- 
raelites abufed the confidence of the Egyp- 
tians, and deprived them of their jewels, by 
an exprefs command of their great law- 
giver ', and the evident conclufion of his 
fcriptural refearches on the liQttnefs of fraud 
\yili be, that every man has an inherent 
right, by the exprefs fanclion of the holy 
fpripturesj to defraud his neighbour^ nay, 

even 



[ 'S ] 

even his brother or his father, as often as 
it lies in his power. 

It would thus be pradicable, under the 
fanilion of Mr. H's yth pofition, to fe- 
led, from the books of the Old Tefta- 
ment, the mofl evident and inconteftibte 
authorities, not only for the lawfulnefs of 
lying, theft, polygamy, and fornication, 
but of the more atrocious crimes of mur- 
der, adultery, and revenge; but it is irk- 
fome to proceed further under the guid- 
ance ofyS det eft able a propoftioUy which, 
under a pretence of paying an implicit 
deference to the judgments of God, ex- 
cludes every confideration of a collateral 
nature, and thereby renders unjuft and 
criminal in its general application, that 
which in the particular inilance, and 
under peculiar circumflances, was right 
and lawful, and calls in the authority of 

the 



t '5 i 

wotd of God to juilify the commiflion of 
crimes of the deeped dye. 

The remainder of the author's data areJ 
employed to ftate in various lights, f^at 
if any a6i (e, g, the Sla^ue Trade J be ab^ 
JiraBedly and ejfentially lawful, no ahufe 
or maUpraSlice can render the principle of 
it criminal ', and that no arguments built 
folely on thofe abufes, can have any weighty 
nnlefs the fame be proved ejfentially unjujl . 
and illicit. 

To attempt a diHindtion between the 
abflrad: nature of any thing and the 
effedts produced by it, is well wor- 
thy one of the difciples of Loyola/ 
but though thefe fubtleties might have 
pafTed current in the days of our an- 
ceftors they are now fomewhat out of 
feafon. A fort of maxim has prevailedjs 
that it is improper to reafon from the 

abufe 



[ 17 ] 

abufe of any given fubje<fl, againfl the 
ufe of it, but it will furely be granted, 
that a pronenefs to abufe is itfelf flrong 
evidence that fomething is wrong in the 
principle. It was not by fubtle dif- 
tincStions of this kind that our Saviour 
inftrudled his followers : He taught us 
to judge of the caufe by its eifedts, and 
not to fuppofe that could be right in its 
principle which was manifeflly wrong in 
its confequences.-^" A good tree, fays he, 
cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a 
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit ; where' 
fore by their fruits ye fhall know them. 
Matt. chap. vii. v. i8, 20. What have 
been the fruits of the African Slave Trade 
I leave to the determination of Mr. H* 
who, by declining to fubmit to this tefl, 
fhews pretty clearly the fenfe he enter- 
tains of the caufe he has undertaken to 
defend, 

i) From 



[ I» ] 

From thefe remarks 1 truft it will evi- 
dently appear, that although the fcrip- 
tures contain the written will of God, 
yet, as in reading the facred volumes we 
muft ufe our eyes, fo, in underftanding 
them, we muft make ufe of our reafon. 
It is true, the Church of Rome pro- 
hibits its followers not only from con- 
fidering, but perufing the fcriptures 5 and 
requires them to be implicitly acknow- 
ledged as equally and invariably true in 
all parts : But the Proteftant Churches 
have difcarded thefe narrow reftraints, 
and not only permit, but require us to 
examine the fcriptures with the utmoft 
degree of attention and care. Shall w6 
then fo far fuffer ourfelves to be blinded 
by the propofitions, or by the fubfequent 
denunciations of Mr. H. as to give up, 
at his fimple requefl:, a right for which 
our anceftors ftruggled at the expence of 
their blood ? Or fliall we not rather, 

like 



[ 19 ] 

like men and proteftants, judge for our- 
felves of the fpirit and tendency of the 
holy fcriptures ? Under this idea it will 
then be neceffiiry, before we ground our 
condud upon the precepts or examples 
they afford us, diligently to examine whe- 
ther fuch examples and precepts are of 
general and univerfal import, or only con- 
fined to a particular perfon or people. 
Whether fome things which are allowed 
or commanded in the Old Teflament 
be not annulled or explained in the new, 
and conftantly to make the mofl accu- 
rate diflindtion between fuch palfages as 
ought to influence our condud:, and fuch 
as are merely narrative. By thefe means 
we {hall perceive, that it would be as 
abfurd to alfert that the inhabitants of 
Great Britain can be juftified in carrying 
away the natives of Africa from their 
country and friends to perpetual fervi- 
tude, becaufe the Jews had domeftic flaves 
D 2 JA 



in their houfes, as to fuppofe that we 
have a right to deftroy all the nations 
round us, becaufe Jofhua fmote thirty- 
one kings on the other fide of the River 
Jordan.*

LETTER II. 



I HAVE in my former letter fhewn, 
that the data required by Mr. H. are 
fuch as cannot be granted, without con- 
iiderable reftri(flions upon their import, 
by any perfon who alTumes the charac- 
ter of a proteftant, or profefTes to make 
ufe of his reafon in the examination of 
the fcriptures. In the prefent, I fhall 
point out in what manner his fubfe- 
quent arguments in favour of the Slave 
Trade, are affedted by this corredion of 
Jiis firfl principles. 

Having ftated as a polition, that every 
ihing contained in the fcriptures is equally 

, true. 



[ 22 ] 

true, and univerfally applicable • without 
any exception whatever of perjon, time, 
QX place ^ or the confideration of any con^ 
curring circumjiancey he proceeds to (hew, 
that the cuftom of flavery was permitted 
in the ancient world, and cites the par- 
ticular examples of Abraham, Jofeph, and 
Jolhua, with many texts on the fubje(5ts -, 
occupying the greatefl: part of his pam- 
phlet with demonftrating, what no one 
ever thought of denying, viz. that the 
Jews were allowed to purchaje bond-men 
and bond-women, of the heathen-^ and un- 
der certain ftip^lations to retain in their 
fervice, even thofe of their own country. 

But it is furely fomewhat extraordinary, 
that fo acute a Logician, after having at 
fuch length laid down his premifes, and 
fand:ioned them by fuch numerous ap- 
peals to holy writ, fhould be^J miferably 
deJeSiive in drawing his conclufions from 

them. 



[ ^3 ] 

them. After having fhewn the Ucitnefs 
of Slavery to the Jews and their imme- 
diate anceftors, it might have been ex- 
ped:ed, that the author would thence 
have deduced the right of the Europeans 
to enjlave the inhabitants of Africa ■ but 
on this important head he is totally lilent: 
and the whole of his reafonings, and re- 
fearches, are equally calculated to prove, 
that the negroes have an inherent right to 
take us and our families arid carry us into 
perpetual Jlavery , as that we have^ a right 
topurfue the African Slave Tirade, 

That the Ifraelites had the permiiHon 
of the Divine Being, to retain in their 
fervice bond-men and bond-women of 
the heathen, and even of their own na- 
tion, for a limited time, is granted; but 
this permiffion appears to have been par- 
ticularly confined to that nation, and was 
not extended to the refl of mankind: 

Nor 



[ 24 ] 

Nor is there in Mr. H's refearches, the 
leaft ground to conclude, that any par- 
ticular nation fucceeded to that extraor- 
dinary privilege over other nations, which 
was exercifed by, and allowed to the 
children of Ifrael.* 

Let us fuppofe then, that fome parti- 
cular perfon, accufed of exerciling a 
right which interfered with the welfare 
of his neighbour, fhould rife up before 
his judges, and inform them by many 
authorities, that the fame right had been 
exercifed by a certain perfon, at fome for- 
mer, but remote period of time ^ and 
having proved this, to the fatisfadtion of 
the court, fliould fit himfelf down, in 
complacent expecftation of a decree in his 

favor. 



* That the praftice of Man-Jiealing, as the objed of a 
general law, was confidered, both under the old and new 
difpenfation, as a criiftc of the higheft magnitude, may ap- 
pter from Exodus <i* xxi. v. 16* Paul's L EpilBe to Tim. 
«. i, V. 9 and 10. 



[ 25 ] 

Would either the judges, or auditors, 
think him intitled ta that decree, till he 
had alfo gone one ftep further, and de- 
monflrated, that be was the perfon who 
had legally fucceeded to fuch right ? 

But perhaps Mr. H. will contend, 
that the permiffion of retaining Haves 
was not confined to the yews, but was a 
general law, extending to the whole hu- 
man race. Now, though I fhall by no 
means acquiefce in this conflrudiion of the 
facred books, yet let us for a moment fee 
what the author of the pamphlet would 
gain by fuch a conceffion. — The refult 
would fimply be, that by the unerring de^ 
cijion of the great parent of the univerfe, the 
flronger nation or individual would have 
an inherent right to opprefs and reduce to 
fervitude, the weaker. A fuppolition 
as injurious to the Divine Goodnefs, 
as any of thofe, upon which Mr. H. 
E has 



[ i6 ] 

has bellowed the epithets of blafphernons 
and prefumptuous. 

Thus then you will perceive, that the 
ordinances of God are fometimes of a ge- 
neral nature, having reference to all man- 
kind ; and fometimes of a particular na« 
ture, having reference only to the peo- 
ple to whom they are immediately de- 
livered. That the firft are uniformly and 
invariably juft and true, and that the fe^ 
cond are alfo juft and true, when applied 
to the fubje6t on which they are intended 
to operate^ but may become unjufl, and 
improper, when applied at the willofmmi 
to other purpofes, and on other occa- 
fions. 

As I apprehend this to be a diilindion 
of great importance in the prefent debate, 
I {hall take the trouble of giving you an 
illuflration of it -, by fhewing how differ- 
ently 



[ 27 ] 

cntly the principles required by Mr. H. 
operate upon any given ,fubje6l, when ad- 
mitted in their full extent, and when 
taken with the reflridions I have ventured 
to lay upon them. Let this be taken from 
the firft inftance mentioned in the pam- 
phlet, and on which Mr. H. lays the great 
weight of his caufe, afferting, " That were 
** all other fcriptural evidences wanting in 
** favor of the Slave Trade, this decree 
*' alone muft convince every impartial 
'* reader, that the licitnefs of that trade 
*^ is evidently warranted by the written 
*' word of God." 

The ftory is that of Hag ar* the hand- 
maid of Sarai, who after fhe had con- 
ceived a fon by Abram her mafter, fled 
from the fight of her miftrefs, becaufe 
fhe dealt hardly with her; and was found 
near a fountain of water in the wilder- 
Rf fs, by an angel of the Lord ; who or- 
E 2 dered 

* Gen. c. xvi. 



[ a8 3 

dered her to return to her miftrefs, an4 
fubmit herfelf under her hands, with a 
promife that the Lord WOU.I4 multiply 
her feed exceedingly. 

Now in making the particular inftance 
of God's dealings with Hagar (for which 
there is no doubt he had the beft an4 
wifeft reafons) a general ruky to be ap- 
plied on all fimilar occafionS, Mr. H. at- 
tempts to eflablifh a mode of proof, 
which, if admitted, would tear up the 
foundations of fociety^ — introduce and 
fancStify a courfe of conduct at open va- 
riance with the firil laws of truth and 
juftice, as derived from God^ and render 
it eafy to juftify any crime which the moft 
abandoned profligate might be induced to 
cpmmit. 

*^ Every circumftaiice, fays he, attend- 
** ing the wretched fituationof this poor: 

1* African 



E 29 ] 

■'* African Slave, who though legally 

€< carried to her mafier, is kept ftill 

** in bondage, and forced as it were out 

?* of his houfe and fervice, in the con- 

^* dition fhe was in through hard ufage 

^' andfeverity, feems to excite compaf- 

f* lion, and juilify her efcape." 

Having thus allowed the apparent in- 
juftice of Hagar's fufFerings, he proceeds. 

" Were Hagar's cafe that of any Afri- 
f* can Female Slave now in the Weft- 
** Indies, and were the fame to be tried 
^* before a jury compofed of fojne of the 
*• prefent advocates for African liberty in 
f* this ijland, one might decide almoft to 
f* a certainty in whofe favor the verdid:

*^* heavy pecuniary muld:. No other 
** verdi(ft would be confiflent with the 
** principles they Jo publickly avow. — But 
*' did Hagar obtain the fame favorable 
*^ fentence at the impartial tribunal of

From this mofl lingular comment Mr. 
H. immediately concludes, ** that the 
" licitnefs of the Have trade is evi- 
** dently warranted by the written word 
** of God." But before we allow the 
cafe of Hagar to be a fanftion for a fub- 
fequent courfe of conduct, of fo diffimi- 
lar a nature, let us examine the de- 
dudions which Mr. H. in his forego- 
ing comment has endeavoured to draw 
from this ftory, and which he muft eila- 
bli{h before it can be of the leafl fervice 
to the caufe it is introduced to fupport : 
Thefe evidently are, 

I. That in cafe the caufe of Hagar had 
been tried before a juft and impartial 
human tribunal, they would have been 

culpable 



f 3^ ] 

culpable in deciding upon it according 
to the known laws of juflice and hu- 
manity. 

II. That on all fubfequent occafions^ 
where a perfon has fuiFered under the 
rod of oppreffion, it is the bufinefs of 
a judge to fend back the fufFerer to re- 
ceive further ill treatment* 

III. That becaufe Hagar was ordered 
hy an angel to return to her miftrefs, it 
is lawful for the merchants of Europe 
to carry on a Trade for Slaves to the coaft 
of Africa. 

I fhall clofe my prefent letter with a 
few obfervations on each of thefe de- 
du(5lions. 

I. The Supreme Being alone can fearch 
the hearts of men, and the reafons of h's 

immediate 



[ 33 ] 

immediate determinations are not always 
. apparent to his creatures, who can only- 
form their imper fed judgment from ex- 
ternal circumflances. — It was therefore 
no doubt confident v/ith his v/ifdom and 
juilice to dired: Hagar's return. lie had 
power to /often the heart of her mifrefs 
towards her^ and to recojnpeife her obe- 
dience as he thought good, — but would an 
earthly tribunal have been therefore ex- 
cufable, in difcarding every principle of 
Juftice, and fending Hagar back to re- 
ceive further ill treatment? — The idea is 
equally wicked and ridiculous. 

II. It feems fcarcely pofTible to con- 
ceive a higher degree of prefumption, 
than that of applying the particular 
judgments of God to fubfequent pur- 
pofes and occafions. That a cafe exaSlly 
fimilar in all points to that of Hagar, has 
ever fince happened, may very fairly be 
doubted 3 and until that does really hap- 
F pen. 



, [ 34 ] 

pen, tke decree of the Supreme Being 
appropriated to that cafe, can never again 
be applicable. Belides, the powers and 
faculties of our minds are not fafficient- 
\y extenfive, to enable us to judge of the 
circumftances in all their connedlions, 
even if fuch a cafe (liould arain exiil.— 

o 

To reafon therefore from this inftance, 
to others which evidently bear only a 
partial or difpant rcfemblance to it, is the 
extreme of arrogance ; and to acfl: in con- 
fequence of fuch reafoning, would be the 
extreme of wickednefs. 

III. But from what circumflances in 
this flory does Mr. H. deduce the very 
extraordinary conclufion, That the Slave 
" Tirade y even when attended with cir- 
'^ cu}7ijl'::nces not altogether coTiformable 
" to the fielinp^s^ of humanity, is ejfenti- 
''ally corJlJicnt with the facred and in- 
*' alienable rights of jii/lice, and has the 

" pofitive 



[ 3S ] 

** po/ifrje fan^lion of God in its f up- 
*' port'" What ? Becaule the Lord, by 
his angel, ordered Hagar to return to 
her mafter, to whom (he was under fome 
kind of obligation for fervice, whether 
voluntary or involuntary doss not appear, 
to whom fhe was legally married and by 
whom 'ih^ was then pregnant ? Does it 
by any rule of confi;ru6lion follow, that 
Mr. H. or any other perfon, has an in- 
herent rights either forcibly, or by the 
colourable pretext of purchafe, to feize 
upon an inhabitant, of Whidah, or Congo, 
whom he had never before feen, to carry 
him on board a fliip, and expofe him for 
feveral months to -variety of dangers,, 
and if he furvives, to deliver him over 
to a planter, to exhauil the remain- 
der of his days in extreme labour, un- 
der the ifnmediate difcipline of the Jcourge "^ 
— Juftice, humanity^ and com non i.:nfe 
equally revolt at fuch a deduftion. — • 
F 2 But 



[ 35 ] 

But as Mr. H. has openly difclaimed 
all connexion with thefe dangerous 
'guides of human condud:, I {hall 
apply my remark in a different form; 
and afTure him, that whenever a ilronger 
hand than his own, Ihall hurry him on 
board a fhip, and conlign him to the 
care of an American planter for the reft 
of his days 3 the cafe of Hagar, will, ac- 
cording to his own explanation of it, 
be as good an authority for this proceed- 
ing, as when it was introduced to give 
a fancftion to the African Slave Trade*

LETTER III. 



I F you will keep in view the diftinc^ 
tion between a blind and fuperftitious ad- 
miffion, that every fadl authorifed in the 
Old and New Teftamont, is to be taken 
as a rule of condud:, without any con- 
lideration of concurrent circumftances ; 
and the reafonable and orthodox con- 
flrudion of the fcriptures, which I have 
contended for, viz. That determina- 
tions in particular circumflances, and 
under fo peculiar a difpenfation as that 
of the Jews, can be no authority for 
general condudt; you will hold in your 
hand a clue, which will fafely guide you 
through all the windings and intricacies 

of 



[ 38 ] 

of Mr. H's labyrintJo, and will find, 
that every other authority he has quoted, 
will, when examined by this rule, have 
as little weight in juftifying the principle 
of the Slave Trade, as the flory of Abram 
and Hagar. 

For inflance,— the hiflory of Jofeph's 
hoarding the corn, and afterwards felling 
it to the Egyptians, contains a great va- 
riety of particular circumflances -, all of 
them intirely different from any thing in 
the African Slave Trade. Jofeph had 
forefeen the famine, and had prudently 
ipade a referve of corn during the feven 
years of plenty; h^ which he had moil 
probably faved the lives of the greateil 
part of the inhabitants 3 but have the 
merchants of Europe ever conferred a 
limilar obligation on the natives of Afri- 
ca ? The purchafe of this corn mufl; 
have amounted to a confiderable fum of 

money, 



I 39 1 

money, which had been circulated amongft 
the Egyptians ; and Jofeph was therefore 
in fome refpetfts juflified in refelling the 
corn, and perhaps at an advanced price. 
But havQjuc^ of the natives of Africa as 
are reduced to flavery, ever received any 
kind of compenfation for the deprivation 
of every thing dear to them ? In the 
event it turns out that Jofeph did not re- 
duce the Egyptians to a flate of ad:ual 
bondage ; but that he entered into a corn- 
pad: with them, viz. That he fhould 
give them feed to fow the land, and that 
they fliould have Jour parts of the pro- 
duce, and Pharaoh the fifth part. 

Not one of the inhabitants was fold to 
any diflant country, nor ever removed 
out of the kingdom of Egypt ; nor does 
it appear, that any other end was effected 

by this tranfaction, than merely the levy- 
ing a tax of one fifth of the produce 

throughout 



[40] 

throughout the kingdom.* No fubfequent 
notice being taken in the facred books, 
that the inhabitants of Egypt were held 
in flavery by their own Kings ', on the 
contrary, it appears that in the following 
reign, the Egyptians had reduced into 
flavery the children of Ifrael, and acted 
the part of tafk-mafters over them.-f* 

What then fliall we think of the rea- 
fonablenefs and modefty of Mr. H. ? who 
has thought it necelTary to employ his 
time in making a calculation of the num- 
ber of inhabitants at that period in E- 
gypt; which he finds to have amounted 
to {even or eight millions, and which he 
fuppofes is a number not unequal to all 
the purchafes of the kind ever made by 
Englifh merchants, fince the commence- 
ment of the flaye trade ! 

After 

* Gen. c. xlvii, v. 26. | Ex. c. i. v. 8. 



[ 41 ] 

After all — will it be fald, that under 
the light we now enjoy in the chriftian * 
difpenfation, the condudt of Jofeph ought 
to be a rule for the conduct of the go- 
vernor of a country in modern times; 
even fuppoUng it poilible the fame events 
fhould again come to pafs ? Would it be 
confident with the very poiitive injunc- 
tion of our Lord, " Give to him that 
ajketh thee, andfrojn him that would bor- 
row of thee turn 72ot thou away V^ The 
withholding the corn till the people fur- 
rendered their lands, and even their per-^ 
fonal liberties, implies a right in Jofeph 
(though at that time the Governor, and 
confequently the protedtor of the country) 
to withhold the corn, even though the in- 
habitants fDOuld periJJj for want of it,-=- 
A po-fition v/hich may well be doubted. 
And, granting the ftory in the extent Mr. 
H. requires, where was the policy or ad- 
G vantage 

* Mat. c. V, V. 42. 



[41 1 

vantage in Pharaoh being a Slave-holder 
or I'yranti rather than the king of a hap- 
py and independent people. 

If then the inftance of Jofeph's con- 
dud:, towards the Egyptians would not in 
modern times, under the light of the Gof- 
pel, be a fanclion for the ruler of a coun- 
try under fimilar circumftances, to fol- 
low his example — how, in the name of 
common fenfe, can it be an authority for 
the Slave 'Trade f By which, without 
any pretence of compenfation, the in- 
habitants of Africa are carried away from 
their native country, and compelled to 
intenfe labour; with no further allow- 
ance than what is barely fufiicient to fup- 
port their exiftence ? The inhabitants 
of Egypt Qn]oy&A four-Jlfihs of the pro- 
duce of the lajid'y their countrymen in 
modern times are not allowed onefftieth, 
Pharaoh we are told was hard of heart. 

What 



[ 43 ] 

JVhat then Jhall we think of the prefent 
fyjiem of Slavery f 

From thefe inflances of Flagar and of 
Jofeph, Mr. H. informs us, he thinks he 
has fufficiently demonllrated that the 
Slave Trade has the indifputable fandion 
of Divine Authority, and is in exa(ft 
conformity with the principles of the 
law of nature, as delineated in the facred 
writings of the word of God. But whe- 
ther fuch reafoning would not difgrace 
any caufe, except the caufe it is intended 
to defend, I leave you to judge. 

I now come to that part of Mr. H's 
work, in which he attempts to fhew, 
that the flave trade is in conformity with 
the principles of the Mofaic law. That 
fuch was the pradice amongfl the Ifrael- 
ites, and that fuch practice was allowed 
under the Mofaic inilitution, I have al- 
G 2 ' ready 



[ 44 ] 

ready admitted : but before I enter fur- 
ther into the difcuflion of this part of the 
queftion, I fhall beg leave to make one 
obfervation on the only hiflorical fad; ci- 
ted by Mr. H. under the law as an au- 
thority for flavery, viz, that of Jofhua's 
treatment of the inhabitants of Gibeon. 

The facred vx;ritings inform us, that the 
land of Gibeon was- given to the children 
of Ifrael, who were authorized by an ex- 
prefs revelation from God, to deftroy all 
the inhabitants ,of the land.* For what 
particular crimes in the nations adjacent 
to the Ifraelites thefe heavy judgements 
were denounced againft them, does not 
appear ; fuch however was the power and 
authority with which Jofliua was invefled 
at the time the event cited by Mr. H. 
took place. 

But 

* Joih. c. i. V. 2. 3. and c. ix. v. 24. 



I 45 1 . 

But where is the revelation by which 
the inhabitants of Africa are delivered up 
to the people of Europe ? Where is the 
authority of the kingdom of England over 
that of Angola ? Whence is it derived ? 
Who hath ever, heard it afferted ? Or in 
what writings, facred or prophane, is it 
to be found ? 

This circumilance, then, which is the 

foundation -ixv^fole jujiijication of Jofliua's 

fubfequent condudl, being wanting in the 

cafe to which it is now applied, intire- 

ly deftroys all limilarity between them. 

For the Gibeonites having been abfo- 
lutely delivered up to the power of Joihua, 
who was authorifed, and even commanded 
to deftroy them ; he could, v/ith the per- 
miffion of God, change that feverity of 
treatment to a milder puniiliment; and 
from fuch change, the Gibeonites derived 

a great. 



t 46 ] 

a great advantage, viz. the prefervatioii 
of their lives. But have the Slave dealers 
of Europe faved from deftrudion and ex- 
tirpation any of the nations of Africa ? 
Have the judgments of God been de- 
nounced againfl: thofe people, and have 
fuch judgments been averted by the 
humanity or interference of the Euro- 
peans ? On the contrary, have they not, 
for ages paft, in oppoiition to the politive 
laws of God, in open contempt of the 
Chriftian religion, and without any other 
authority than that of being the ftrongeft, 
defolated and difpeopled one of the mofl 
populous and fertile parts of the univerfe ? 
Whether this has given them a right, 
equal to that of Jofhua over the Gibe- 
onites, I leave to Mr. H. to explain, I 
mufl however agree with him in think- 
ing, that it is eafy to conclude^ whether 
the reducing the innocent as well as the 
guilty -part of our fellow creatures to the 

condition 



[ 47 3 

condition of Jlavess or even to hereditary 
bondage or JJavery, be in its own nature 
licit, or illicit y criminal y or wijiiji. And 
I truft that no perfon who has candidly 
attended to the fubjed: in difpute can 
have a doubt upon the queflion.

HAVE already admitted, that the 
pradice of flavery was permitted to the 
Ifraelites and their immediate anceflors: — ^ 
But I have at the fame time alTerted, that 
fuch permiffion was confined to that peo- 
ple only, and was not extended to the refl 
of mankind. I fhall now undertake to 
fhew, that the pradlice of flavery, as al- 
lowed to the Ifraelites, fo far from re- 
ceiving a fandion from, was abolifhed by 
the Chriflian difpenfation, as being to- 
tally irreconciieable with the firft prin- 
ciples of the religion of its divine au- 
thor. 

Mr. 



[ 49 ] 

Mr. H. has endeavoured to iatrencli 
liimfelf, by every precaution in his pov^er, 
againfl the attack, which he well knew 
his caufe was expofed to receive from- 
this quarter, and has ftipulated, that the 
books of the Old and New Teflamentj 
fhall be confidered as of equal authority. 
But if Mr. H. be as fully fatisfied as he 
pretends to be, that the dodrines of our 
Saviour are uniformly of the fame ten- 
dency as thofe of the Mofaic Lav/, why 
does he fo earneilly labour to eilablifh a 
propoiition, which the greatslt part of 
his readers will fcarcely be inclined to 
grant him ? Does he not appear to have 
been aware, not only that his caufe would 
derive no authority from the New Teita- 
ment, but that the difpenfations of the 
new law, might in fome refpeds inter- 
fere with and contradict: thofe of the 
Old ? 

H - That 



I so 1 

That this may reafonably be prefum- 
ed to be Mr. H's true motive for endea- 
vouring to eilablifh the equal authority 
•of the Old and New Teftament, will ap- 
pear from coniidering the reafon he gives, 
for having been more particular in bring- 
ing the lall part of his refearches into 
what he calls a central point of view, viz. 
** That he has reafon to apprehend, that 
** feveral of his readers would be apt to 
" imagine, that by the eftablifhment of 
<* the Chriftian Pvcligion the Law of 
*/ Mofes was totally aboliihed, and an- 
** nulled in every part of it 3 and to every 
** intent and purpofe, both typical and 
*^ moral." Now it is impoiTible for Mr. 
** H. to be fo ignorant as not to know, 
that every fe(£l and denomination of Chrif- 
tians admit the moral precepts of the 
Old Teftament, whenever they do not 
interfere with the purer dcdlrines of the 
Chriilian fcheme — this then could not be 

the 



[ 5' ] 

the true motive for his being fo particular 
on this head. The fad: is, he hoped that 
by eftablifhing the equality of the Old 
Teflament to the New, he could with 
more advantage make the authorities which 
he pretended to find in the former, for 
the general juflilication of ilavery, mili- 
tate againfi: the exprefs and unequivocal 
precepts againil it^ which are contained in 
the latter. 

, Of what great importance the eftablifh- 
ment of this proportion is to Mr. H's 
argument, will appear from the ufe he 
has attempted to make of it. *' From 
*' this undeniable polition, .fiys he, it 
'* follows neceffarily, that ds the ivrit- 
** ings of both the T'ejl anient s have the 
^^ fame weight of authority, eifentially in- 
" capable of contradidiing itfelf, in fup-

^^ whatever is declared in the one to be

*^ appears, as I trtift it does, i^ovii the 
" preceding train of Scriptural Argu- 
*' ments, in perfed: harmony with the 
'^ principles and decifions of the word 
** of God, regiftered in the facred writ-

?^ fufficient to verify my third and laft 
?* aiTertion refpcding the licitnefs of the 
?' Slave Trade, as perfedlly conformable 
** to the principles of the Chriflian dif- 
f penfation. 

Thus Mr. H, has repofed the whole 
weight of his argument in favour of the 
Slave Trade, under the Chriflian dif- 
penfation (as unfupported by any colla- 
teral evidence from the writins;s of the 
New Teftament) on this iingle propofi- 
tion, " t&at the writings of both the Tef- 
tammts have the fame 'weight of autho^ 
rityj' I fhall therefore firfl proceed to 
give the rnofl indubitable evidence that 
this is not the fa5i -, and that the New 
Tellament not only pojfejfes, but has exer- 

cifed a controlling power over the Old, 
even in points of moral conduSi, in confe- 
quence of which^ *' This general and 
f* forcible argument^ which is itfelffuf- 

** iicient 



[ 54 ] 

** ficient to verify the aflertion that the 
*' licitnefs of the Slave Trade is perfectly 
** conformable to the principles of the 
** Chriftlan difpenfation," will be found 
** entirely groundlefs ; ■ — after which I 
fliail proceed to confider what he calls his 
collateral evidences derived from the New 
Teflament. 

After having, with fome indecency of 
Cxpreffion, afTerted that " God never did, 
nor ever could, alter by any difpenfa- 
tion whatever, thofe eternal principles 
and lawsi which are the very bafis and 
foundation of true religion ; and confe- 
fequently of the religion of Chrifl," he 
adduces, as he fays, *' no lefs an autho- 
*' rity in confirmation of this indifputable 
*f dodtrine, than the very words of the 
** Son of God, who in that divine fer- 
*' mon on the mount, in which he gave 
^* his difciples a moll minute and circumr 

flantial 



^« {lantial account of the principles and 
tenets of his gofpel, condemned the 
above erroneous opinion in the moll 
explicit terms, and forbad them even 
to think of it. Think not, /aid he, that 
I am mm to dejlroy the law or the 
prophets -, I came not to dejiroy but to 
fulfil." 

This being the only authority pro- 
duced by Mr. H, in fupport of his af- 
fertion, of the equality of the Old and 
New Tejlament, I fliall iirft point out, 
what I conceive to be the true pur- 
port of that paiTage^ and {hall after- 
wards produce fuch authorities, in fup- 
port of my opinion, as I think the 
warmeft friends of Mr. H. muft admit to 
be decifive on the point in queilion. 

" 'Think not, fays our Saviour, that I 
*< am come to deftroy the law and the pro- 

*« phets'. 



[ 56 ] 

** phets ', Iain not come to deftroy but to 

" fulfil:' 

By v/hich is clearly to be underlloodj 
that he came not to overthrow thofe firfl 
principles of morality, which are incul- 
cated in the Old Teftament, but to im^ 
prove and carry them to a, higher degree 
of perfeBion 5 and accordingly in the fe- 
of his difcourfe, he adverts to 77tany 
aBions and modes of conduB which were 
permitted under the old law, but which 
he declares are improper, and aBually pro» 
hihits, thereby making a moft ejjential dif- 
ference between the morality of the Old 

1'ejiament and that of the new»

Could any doubt remain after confider- 
ing the foregoing paflage, as^ to the mean- 
ing of our Saviour's declaration, that he 
came not to dejtroy but to fulfil, or the 
fuperior and controlling povi^er of the 
Chriflian difpenfation, the following ex- 
plicit declaration of the apoftle Paul, 
upon the fubjedl, will perhaps have as 
much weight as the pofitive aflertions of 
Mr. H. to the contrary, 

Heb. c. 7. V, 18. ** For there is verily 
** a dif annul ling of the commandment going 

** before 



I S9 1 

*' before, for the weaknefs and unprofta" 
*' blenefs thereof

" feSft but the bringing in of a better 
'* hope did, by the which we draw nigh 
^^ unto God. 

"22. By fo much was Jefus made a 
^' furety of a better ^ eft anient.'' 

Thus then it appears to demonflration, 
that the Christian religion, is not only 
fuperior to the Mofaic inftitution, but 
that it's authority was exerted to change 
or make void, or in the words of the 
apoflle, " to dif annul the command^ 
ment going before 'y' and confequently all 
denominations of Chriftians mufl: admit, 
that wherever the fan(5lions and ordi- 
nances of the Old Teftament, interfere 
with the purer dodrines and more hu- 
I 2 mane 



I 60 1 

mane precepts of the New, they are nol 
to be regarded as of fufficient weight tq 
juftify the followers of Chrifl:^ in the imi= 
tation of them. 

Nor is it from this circumflance to be 
prefumptuoufly inferred (as Mr.H. affed^ 
to think) " That God is not confident 
** with hinifelf 5 or that the religion of

** the reproach and condemnation of the

not of general import, but was princi- 
pally confined to the Jews -, and contained 
regulations, both of a civil and religious 
nature, proper to that people, under d, 
Theocratic Government, but inapplica- 
ble in many inftances to mankind in 
general.-~Nor was it in many refpeds fo 
pure and perfed in its moral precepts, as 
that with which mankind were afterwards 

favoured. 



[ 6i 1 

favoured. Upon this point the teftimony 
of the apoftle Paul, in his Epiille to the 
Qalatians (who appear to have receded 
from the gofpel difpenfation to the in- 
adequate precepts of the old lavi^) is fo 
peculiarly applicable, that I cannot avoid 
citing it as a full anfwer to Mr. Harris's 
^harge of inconfiftency in the Old and 
New Teftaments, 

Galatians c. 3. v. 19. *' Wherefore then 
" Jerveth the law? It was added becaufe 
^' of tranfgreffions, till the feed ihould 
f' come to whom the promife was made, 
^' and it was ordained by angels in the 
f^' hand of a mediator, 

** 21. Is the. law then agalnjl the pro- 
f * mifes of God ? God forbid— iov if there 
*' had been a law given, which could 
f* have given Ife — verily right eoufnefs. 
ff Jhould have been by the law, 

f' 22. But 



[ 6i ] ^ 

"22. But the fcripture hath concluded 
" all under fin — that the promife by faith 
** of Jefus Chrifl might be given to them 
** that believe. 

** 23. But before faith came we were 
*^ kept under the law, ihut up unto the 
** faith, which fhould afterwards be re- 
*• vealed. 

" 24. Wherefore the law was our fchool 
*' majier to bring us unto Chrift, that 
** we might be juftified by faith, 

** 25. But after that faith is come we 
^* are no longer under afchoohiafierJ' 

From this palTage then it will appear, 
that the daring accufation thrown out 
by Mr. H. that the Supreme Being 
is inconfiftent with himfelf, beeaufe 

he 



[ 63 ] 

he did not, under the Chriftian dif- 
penfation, confirm and confine himfelf 
to every moral injundiion of the Old 
Teftament, can only be madeyz/r/5 perfonsy 
as having for intereiled purpofes attempted 
to eftabliHi a fyilem which the evident 
purport of the Scriptures cannot fupport; 
have no method to hide their difgrace, but 
by this dired: and dreadful imputation on 
the facred v^ritings and their Divine au- 
thor. 

It is alfo eqaully evident from the 
foregoing pafiages of the New Teftament, 
not only that the moral prohibitions of 
our Saviour extended further than the in- 
junctions of the old law, and rendered 
that condudl unlawful, which had before 
been permitted, but that fuch prohibi- 
tions ad:ually extended to the particular 
cafe in queftion, and that all praBices^ 
inimical to the general welfare and in- 

terefts 



I 64 ] 

tefejfls of mankind, were from thenc^s 
forth to be abolifhed; for if it be the duty 
of a Chrijiian not to rejifi evil-^to love bis 
enemies — to blefs ttofe that curfe, and 
pray for thofe who perfecute him, — hoW 
can it be fiippofed that he full at the fame 
time have an inherent right to do evil to 
cnother — to injure thofe who never injured 
him — and to defray thofe, who fo far from 
having either perfecuted, or curfed him^ 
have never known that fuch a perfon was 
in exifence ? 

1 do not conceive it necellary to follow 
Mr. Hw through the tedious argument, by 
whicli he labours to prove, that the fi- 
lence of the New Teilament refpeding 
the Slave Tirade, (fiippofing it to be filent 
on the fubjed:) is a virtual apprcbadon 
of that pradice. The New Teflament 
Js totally iilent on many crimes of the 
greatefl magnitude, if fueh filence is to be 

inferred 



[ 6s ] 

inferred from its not cont2iimng particular 
prohibitions againji them ; — but will any 
perfon contend that fuch crimes are law- 
ful, becaufe no fpeciiic denunciations are 
pronounced againft them by our Saviour ? 
Or are they not underftood to be in-^ 
eluded in thofe general prohibitions and 
commands, to love our neighbour as our- 
felves, which compofe the fum and ef- 
fence of the Chriftian religion ? 

But if the Books of the New Tefla- 
ment be filent on many particular offences, 
they lay down general and mo/l powerful 
precepts for the regulation of the heart and 
life, leaving the profeflbrs of Chriftianity 
to apply thefe precepts to particular cafes ; 
and they who have imbibed the true fpirit 
of charity, breathed in the gofpel, will not 
find it neceifary to adopt a long train of 
reafoning, in order to perceive whether 
the Slave Trade be lawful, or not 3 but 
as foon as they underfland its nature and 
K confe- 



I 66 ] 

confequences, will feel a lively conviction, 
t/bat chrijilanity abhors the praSiice, 

The implied arguments of Mr. H. 
in favour of the Slave Trade, from the. 
exaB conformity of the moral precepts of 
the New T^efament with thofe of the Old, 
and from the filence of the New Tejia^ 
ment on that fpecific crime t being thus fuf- 
iiciently refuted -, it may now be proper 
to turn to what he calls his collateral 
proofs from the New Teftament, or thofe 
paiTdges which he pretends afford a pofi- 
tive fandtion to the Slave Trade, under 
the New Law. 

This fandion he conceives he has found 
in two of the Epiftles of Paul, viz. The 
ill of thofe to Tim. c. vi. v. i, and that 
to Philemon, v. 8. 

But what ihall we fay, if this llender 

twi^. 



[ 67 1 

twig, which is now the only fupport of 
the finking advocate of Slavery^ (hould 
defert him ; and it fliould appear, from a 
candid and difpaffionate examination of 
the paflages in queflion, that the precepts 
of the apoftle, introduced by Mr. H. to 
juflify a courfe of condud: in dired: oppo- 
iition to the precepts of Chriftianity, 
afford not the flighted inference inimi- 
cal to the general rules of good will and 
benevolence inculcated in other parts of 
the New Teflament. 

In the pafTage firft cited by Mr. H. 
Tim. c. vi. v. i, the apoflle Paul exhorts 
** as many as are under the yoke, to count 
*' their mafters worthy of all honour, that 
'? the name of God and his dodrine be 
** not blafphemed ; and that they who 
*' have believing mafters, fliould not def- 
** pife them, becaufe they areobrethren, 
" but rather do them fervice, &c." — 
K 2 From 



[ 68 ] 

from whence he infers, ** that the pri^ 

* mitive Chriftians were not only not 

* forbidden, bat exprefsly allowed^ by 
' the principles of our religion, the pur- 

* chafing of ilaves, and keeping their 

* fellow creatures, nay, even their fel- 
'^ low chriftianSj under the yoke of bon- 

* dage or flavery," 

Now taking for granted, what perhaps 
may well be difputed, that the perfons 
fpoken of in this paffage were Ilaves for 
life, — it mufl be remembered, that the 
great author of the Chriftian fyfiem did 
not think proper to oppofe his authority 
to the political arrangements which at the 
time of his miffion fubfifted on the face 
of the earth. His dodirines always in- 
culcated fubmiffion to fuperiors, and pa- 
tience under injuries ; and this do(5lrin^ 
the apoftle applies in the prefent inilance, 
to a particular clafs of perfons, to whom 

he 



[ H 3 

he thought fuch adaionitlons were necef- 
fary ^ requiring them ** to count their 
mailers worthy of all honour," meaning 
thereby, that during the continuance of 
their fervitude (the origin^ nature, or 
duration of which does not appear,) they 
fhould perform their duty, and patiently 
fubmit to the lituation in which they were 
placed ; but by no means juftifying any 
perfon who held another in illegal or for- 
cible fubjeSlion, The apoftle exhorts thefe 
fervants to account their mailers worthy 
of all honour, that the name of God 
and his doilrine be not blafphemed -, but 
which Chriilian like fubmiilion, and for- 
bearance, though an aSi of virtue in the 
fervanf, could by no means juflify, but 
would rather tend to aggravate, the crime 
of the mailer. In exad: conformity to 
this dodrine is the precept of our Sa- 
viour, " If any one ftrike thee on thy right 
cheeky turn to him the other alfo,'" But 

will 



[ 70 ] 

will Mr* H. maintain that it is lawfal t^ 
ftrike a Chriflian, becaufe his religion 
commands him not to refifl evil ? Or is 
it not rather the highefl aggravation, that 
the meek and peaceable deportment of the 
perfon offended, could not fecure him 
from infult and abufe ? 

The long quotation Mr. H, has made 
from the Epiflle of Paul to Philemon, is 
fo far from being a juftiiication of llavery, 
that to every perfon not perufing the fcrip- 
tures with a particular bias on his mind, it 
is evidently a powerful exhortation againfl 
it. The apoftle fends back .Onefimus to 
his mafler, requeuing him to receive him, 
" 72ot as afervant, but above a fervant y 
*' a brother beloved y efpecially to me, but 
** how much more unto thee, both in the 
*^ fiefi and in the Lord'' Where does the 
apoftle addrefs Philemon in the words ex- 
prellly attributed to him by Mr. H. ** that 

he 



[ 7' ] 

he would never attempt to deprive him of his 
fiave T' Where does he acknowledge to 
Philemon, '•■ that Onelimus is his own 
brother in Chrift, though Jlill his pro- 
perty according to the Jiejh ?'' Thefe paf- 
fages feem to be the laft refort of a per- 
fon, who, not being able to fupport his 
alTertion from the evident purport of the 
words, is obliged to have recourfe to 
forgery and interpolation, . 

Such however are the grounds upon 
which Mr. H. has ventured to infringe 
upon the pofitive commands of our Sa- 
viour, with refpedt to our conducft to- 
wards each other J — but an apprehenfion 
arifing in his mind, that thefe paffages 
might, after all the pains employed in 
inforcing them, be infufficient to anfwer 
his purpofe, whilft the precepts of good 
will given to mankind in the New Tef- 
fament remained unimpeached — he finds 

it 



C 72 ] 

it necefTary, in the laft place, to abridge 
the purport of thefe precepts, and to 
weaken their influence. For this purpofe^ 
he feleds out of the many fimilar paffages 
which the New Teftament affords, one 
which he conceives may bear a more li- 
mit ted {enfQ j and be explained in fuch a 
jnanner, as not to appear inconfiflent with 
his favourite eflablifhment. Whether he 
has been fortunate in his feled;ion will 
appear from a fliort invefligation. 

Matt. c. vii. v. 12. ** All things 
" whatfoever ye would that men fhoul4 
** do to you, do ye even fo to them ; for 
** this is the law and the prophets." 

This divine precept, delivered by Chrid; 
to his difciples at the concluiion of his 
fermon on the mount, is fo flricft an in- 
juri(ftion againfl every kind of injuftice 
and oppreilion ; expreifed in a manner fo 

forcible^ 



[ 73 ] 

forcibly, and prefcriblng a tefl of our 
condudt fo eafily applied upon every oc- 
cafion, that Mr. H. was aware it could 
not be overlooked in this controverfy -, 
and he has accordingly employed the 
utmoft of his fophiftry to evade its 
import. 

After ftating the paflage, he gives the 
converfe of it in the following words. 

** Whatfoever things therefore we 
" would not that men fhould do to us, 
*' we are not even fo to do to them; but 
" no perfon whatever would certainly 
** wifh that a fellow creature {hould re- 
** duce him to the condition of a flave, 
" therefore no perfon whatever is to re- 
" duce a fellow creature to that con- 
" dition." 

*' Here, fays he, I muft obferve, that 
L ** no. 



[ 74 3 

^' no one can juftly tax me with any 
" partiality to the caufe I have efpoufedj 
** I have, I think, worded the argument 
** againft it, in terms as forcible as the 
" moft zealous advocate for African li« 
** berty could ufe ; but unanfwerable as 
** the fame may appear to them, it is but 
** a planjibk argument at the bejl. 

" It is an axiom in logic, that an ar- 
" gument that proves too much, proves 
** nothing — the above is juji fuch a one i 
^' for by the fame manner of reafoning, 
<* one might equally conclude, contrary 
** to the law, and the prophets, and the 
** dodtrine of the Cbriftian Religion, that 
** not only flavery, but every other kind 
*^ of fubordination of one man to anq- 
^^ ther, ought not to be fuffered to cour 
** tinue in the world. The argument, if 
^? conclulive in the former cafe, mufl be 

** equally 



[ 75 1 

^^ equally fo in the latter. I enforce it 
" thus: — 

*' All things whatfoever, fays our 
** bkfTed Saviour, that men Jhould do to 
*' yoii, do ye evenfo to them, for this is 
** the law and the prophets. Whatfoever 
** things therefore we would not that 
** men fhould do to usj we are not even 
** fo to do to them -, but every perfon 
" would naturally wifh not to be con- 
** trouled by a fellow creature, not to 
-** be under any fubjeBion to him, hot to 
** be abfolute mafter of his own actions ; 
" no perfon therefore ought to keep a fel- 
** low creature under any controul or fub- 
** je6tion whatever." 

Surely fo manifeft a perverlion cf the 
precepts of Chrillj never before difgraced 
the prefs. It is not true that every per- 
fon would wiOi not to be .controuled by a 

L 2 fellO'Ui: 



[ 76 ] 

fellow creature, nor to be under anyfub" 
jeBion to him, but to be abfolute majler of 
his own adtions. Every man of common 
fenfe knows, that from the conftitutiori: 
of the univerfe, he is dependant on, and 
mufl necefTarily in many refped:s be con- 
trouled by others ^ and none but an ideot 
would wiHi to be difcharged from the re- 
lative duties of life, and to be abfolute 
mafler of his ov^n adlions. Nor is any 
iituation in life exempt from this general 
law, which by an interchange of good 
offices binds together the vaft fabrick of 
fociety — but every man may reafonably 
objed: to his being forcibly reduced to a 
fate of favery, and deprived of thofe 
natural rights which the refl of mankind 
enjoy — a ftate which fo far from occafion- 
ing an interchange of good offices, gives 
rife on the one hand only to pride, cruelty 
andinjuftice; and on the other, to fear, 
meannefsy and hatred. It does not then- 

by 



i 77 1 
by any means follow, that i^ecaufe man- 
kind have an uniform averfion to a ftate 
of llavery, they have therefore a diflike 
to all the other natural and juft fubor- 
dinations and dependencies of life 5 and 
-Mr. H's impeachment of this precept 
is therefore as unfounded as all his other 
attempts to explain away the evident pur- 
port of the dodrines of the New Tef- 
tament. 

Having found that the fenfb evidently 
implied in, and univerfally underftood 
from thefe words, is not the true one, 

he gives us his own definition of it.- 

" Every Chriflian, fays he, is taught and 
" direded to do unto others as he would 
«* be done unto, and by a neeeifarf 
*« confequence, not to do unto others as 
*' he would not be done unto ;— that is, 
*' fays he, every Chriftian is commanded 
•* to behave to his neighbour in what- 

«« ever 



[ 78 1 

** ever iituation or circumflances in life 
*' providence may have placed them bothf 
** juft as he would wifli his neighbour to 
** behave to him, in his fituation, w^ere 
** his neighbour's Iituation and circum- 
*' fiances his own.'* Defpicable evafion ! 
Wretched fophiftry ! Shall a man, who 
has voluntarily and forcibly reduced ano- 
ther to a ftate of the moft abjedl mifery 
of which his nature is capable, impioully 
alf6ft that providence has placed him in 
that \fituation ? Shall he fatlsfy himfelf 
with the plaufible pretext of ading with 
kindnefs towards him, whilft he has it in 
his power to extend to him that mercy 
which in the fame Jituation he would him^ 
felf mojl ardently wijh for. As well might 
the midnight murderer, who holds the 
knife over the innocent vicflim of his cru- 
elty, aifert that providence had delivered 
him into his hands, and claim a ETierit in 
putting him to death with as little pain 

as 



[ 79 3 

as poflible. Surely if it be the duty of 
a Chriftian, to relieve thofe who are in 
iituatioiis of diftrefs, it is not lefs in*: 
cumbent on him to place them in a bet- 
ter lituation, as often as it lies in hi§ 
power. 

That the Chriftian religion is inimical 
in its nature to every fpecies of oppref- 
fion, and particularly to that which in- 
volves in it almofl every other kind of 
guilt, is I hope already evide^nt. But as 
a further confirmation of this fentiment, 
it may not be improper to fhew, what 
has been the general fenfe of mankind as 
to the fpirit and purport of the Chriftian 
religion. So oppofite are its precepts to 
the encouragement of flavery, that a ce* 
lebrated hiftorian,* has not fcrupled to 
account for the degree of liberty, which 
js at prefent enjoyed throughout moll 

parts

|)arts of Europe, from the influence of 
this religion on the minds of the people. 
' — I {hall give you the palTage.— 

** The gentle fpirit of the Chriftian 
^* religion, together with the dodlrines 
** which it teaches concerning the ori-- 
** ginal equality of mankind, as well 
** as the impartial eye with which the 
** Almighty regards men of every con- 
«* dition, and admits them to a partici^ 
•* pation of his benefits, are inconfiftent 
** with fervitude -, but in this, as in many 
** other inflances, conJiderattQns of interejiy 
*• and the maxims of falfe -policy, led men 
" to a condud: inconfiftent with their 
** principles. They were fo fenfible, 
^* however, of their inconfiftency, that 
^^ to fet their fellow Chriftians at liberty 
** from fervitude, was deemed an ad; of 
*< piety highly meritorious and accept- 
^* able to heaven. The humane fpirit 
^^ of the Chrijiian rdigiofi ftruggled with 

the 



[ 8i 1 

** the maxims and manners of the world, 

** and contributed more than any other 

** circumjlance to introduce the praBice 

** of manumijjion" 

The fame author furnifhes us with an 
authentic document, as a proof of this 
fadt; which as it proceeds from the 
apoftolic chair, will have its due weight 
with Mr. H. It contains the reafons 
affigned by Pope Gregory the Great, in 
the lixth century, for granting liberty to 
his Haves. 

" Cum Redemptor nofter, totius con- 
** ditor naturae, ad hoc propitiatus, hu- 
*' manam carnem voluerit aiTumere, ut 
** divinitatis fuae gratia, dirempto (quo 
** tenebamur captivi) vinculo, priftinae

M " ilituit 



. [ s. ] 

" ftituit fervitutis, in ea qua nati fue- 
^' rant> manumittentis beneficio, liber-tate

And the ufual tenor of the charters 
of manumiffion is — -pro amore dei—pro re^ 
medio animcti &c. clearly expreffing the 
fenfe the inhabitants of Europe have en- 
tertained, that the manumiffion of Haves 
was an ad: in confor?nity to the precepts 
of the Chrijiicm religion. 

Were I to continue thefe authorities 
down to the prefent times, and cite to 
Mr. H. the opinions of the many re- 
fped:able clergymen of every fed in thefe 

kingdoms 

* Seeing that Jefus Chrlft, the author of all nature, for 
this exprcfs purpofe, affumed the flefh, that by the favour 
of his divine power (the bonds of captivity being broken) 
he might reftore us to our former liberty : We conceive it 
to be devoutly done, if, by the favour of manumiffion. 
Men, whom nature originally made free, and human laws 
fubjefted to the yoke of fervitude, were again reftored to 
that liberty in which they were born. 



[ 83 ] 

kingdoms who have oppofed this unlaw- 
ful traffic ; feme of them folely and ex~ 
preffly on the ground of its being con- 
trary to the didates of the Chriftian 
Religion, they would perhaps have little 
weight with him; but with the rational 
and difpaffionate part of mankind, they 
will not be without their efFed; ; and will 
be no inconfiderable authority, towards 
the dedud:ion which I conceive I may 
fairly be allowed to make from the fore- 
going remarks, viz. That the prac- 
tice OF SLAVERY, AS ALLOWED A- 
MONGST THE JewS, WAS ABROGA- 
TED BY THE GOSPEL DISPENSATION, 
AND DOES NOT NOW EXIST EITHER 
IN THEIR IMMEDIATE DESCENDANTS 
OR IN ANY OTHER PEOPLE, 

If Mr. H. remains diiTatisfied with a 

conclufion in fuch dired: oppofition to the 

long corollaries at the end of his book, 

M 2 he 



[ 84 ] 

he rnufl contend, that the particular pjrl-j 
vilege granted to the Jews, and their an- 
ceftors, is not annulled^ bat yet exifts in 
full force. And, as I have before re- 
marked, muft, iffuch a prhiiege be he- 
reditaryy inflitute an enquiry into their 
lineal defcendants, among ft whom I ap- 
prehend he will find fome difficulty in 
in rolling the inhabitants of thefe king- 
doms. 

But if he denies alfo this lad propofi^ 
tion ; and alTerts that the permiffion of 
holding others in flavery, was given in- 
difcriminately to all mankind j I muft 
beg you once more to coniider for a mo- 
ment the confequences and abfurdities of 
Jiich apqfition. If all mankind pojfefs from 
God, an inherent right to reduce into fub- 
jeBion any others of their ffecies, this 
rieht is inherent as well in the fla-ve as in 
bis mafer, who will therefore be perfedly 

juftified 



[ 8J ] 

juftified in making ufe of his utmofl cxt 
ertions to change Jit nations with him ; and 
fhould he fucceed in his attempt, will, 
in his turn, have " the pofitive fancftion 
of God," for holding by force his former 
majier in fuhje^ion to him. Thus then 
this univerfal permiffion or licit nefs of 
ilavery, contended for by the author of 
the pamphlet, terminates in a vindication 
of univerfal oppreffion, — in an affertion 
of the right of the ftronger, at all times 
to injure and opprefs the weaker. In 
Ihort, in a general annihilation of all 
thofe reftraints, • which Law, Reafon, 
Religion, and Common Senfe, have hi- 
therto impofed upon mankind. 



THE END.
