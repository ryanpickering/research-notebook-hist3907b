PEEAMBLE. 

Whereas, we believe that Slavery is contra- 
ry to the precepts of Christianity, dangerous to 
the liberties of the country, and ought immedi- 
ately to be abolished ; and whereas, we believe 
that the citizens of New England not only have 
the right to protest against it, but are under the 
highest obligation to seek its removal by a mor- 
al influence ; and whereas, we believe that the 
free people of color are unrighteously oppress- 
ed, and stand in need of our sympathy and be- 
nevolent co-operation ; therefore, recognizing 
the inspired declaration that God ' hath made of 
one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all 
the face of the earth,' and in obedience to our 
Savior's golden rule, 'all things whatsoever ye 
would that men should do to you, do ye even 
so to them;' we agree to form ourselves into a 
Society, and to be governed by the following 

CONSTITUTION.

DECLARATION 



OF THE 

ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION. 

ASSEMBLED IN PHILADELPHIA, DECEMBER 4, 1833. 



The Convention, assembled in the city of Pliiladelphia 
to organize a INational Anti-Slavery Society, promptly seize 
the opportunity to promulgate the following DECLARA- 
TION OF SENTIMEM.'fS, as cherished hy them in rela- 
tion to the enslavement of one-sixth portion of the Ameri- 
can people. 

More than fifty-seven years have elapsed since a band of 
patriots convened in this place, to devise measures for the 
deliverance of this country from a foreign yoke. Thecor- 
ner stone upon which they founded the Templk of Free- 
dom was broadly tl'.is — 'ttiat all men are created equal; 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inali- 
enable rights ; that amoiig these are life, LIBERTY, and 
the pursuit ol happiness.' At the sound of their trumpet- 
call, three millions ol people rose up as from the sleep of 
death, and rushed to the strife of blood ; deeming it more 
glorious to die instantly as freemen, than desirable to live 
one hour as slaves. They were few in number — poor in re- 
sources; but the honest conviction that Truth, Justice, 
and Right were on their side, made them invincible. 

We have met together for the achievement of an enter- 
prise, without which, that of our fathers is incomplete; and 
which, for its magniliule, solemnity, and probable results 
upon the destiny of the world, as far transcends theirs, as 
moral truth does physical force. 

In purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of 
purpose, in intrepidity of action, in stedfastness of faith, in 
sincerity of spirit, we would not be inferior to them. 

Their principles led them to wage war against their op- 
pressors, and to spill human blood like water, in order to be 



7 



free. Ours forbid the doing of evil that good may come, and 
lead us to reject, and to entreat the oppressed to reject, the 
use of all carnal weapons for deliverance from bondage; re- 
lying solely upon those which are spiritual, and mighty 
through God to the pulling down of strong holds. 

Their measures were physical resistance — the marshalling 
in arms — the hostile array — the moral encounter. Ours 
shall be such only as the opposition of moral purity to mor- 
al corruption — the destruction of error by the potency of 
truth — the overthrow of prejudice by the power of love — 
and the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance. 

Their grievances, great as tUey were, "were trifling in 
comparison with the wrongs ami sufferings of those for 
whom we plead. Our fathers were never slaves — never 
bought and sotd like cattle — never shut out from the light of 
knowledge and religion — never subjected to the lash of bru- 
tal task masters. 

But those, for whose enmncipation we are striving, — con- 
stituting at the present time at least one-sixth part of our 
countrymen, — are recognized by the laws, and treated by 
their fellow-beings, as marketable commodities — as goods 
and chattels — as brute beasts ; are plundered daily of the 
fruits of their toil without redress; really enjoy no con- 
stitutional nor legal protection from licentious and murder- 
ous outrages upon their persons; and are ruthlessly torn 
asunder — the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother 
— the heart-broken wife from her weeping husband — at the 
caprice or pleasure of irresponsible tyrants. For the crime 
of having a dark complexion, they suffer the pangs of hun- 
ger, the infliction of stripes, and the ignominy of brutal ser- 
vitude. They are kept in heathenish darkness by laws ex- 
pressly enacted to make their instruction a criminal of- 
fence. 

These are the prominent circumstances in the condition 
of more than two millions of our people, the proot of which 
may be found iu thousands of indisputable facts, and in tlffiF*. 
laws of the slavehoKling States. 

Hence we maintain — 'J'hat in view of the civil and reli- 
gious privileges of this nation, the guilt of its oppression is 
nne(iualled by any other on the face of the earth ; and, there- 
fore, that it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the- heavy 
burden, to break every yoke, and to let the oppressed go 
free. 

We further maintain — That no man has a right to en- 
slave or imbrute his brother — to hold or acknowledge him, 
for one moment, as a piece of merchandize — to keep back 



8 



his hire by fraud — or to brutalize his mind by denying him 
the means of intellectual, social, and moral improvement. 

The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable. To invade it, 
is to usurp the prerogative of Jehovah. Every man has a 
right to his own body — to the products of his own labor — 
to the protection of law— and to the common advantages of 
society. It is piracy to buy or steal a native African, and 
subject him to servitude. Surely the sin is as great to en- 
skve an American as an African. 

Therefore we believe and aflirm — That there is no differ- 
ence, in principle, between the African slave trade and 
American slavery — That every American citizen, who re- 
tains a human being in involuntary bondage, as his property, 
is, [according to Scri|)ture,] a mak-stealicr — That the 
slaves ought instantly to be set free, and broi;ght under the 
protection of law — That if they had lived from the time of 
Pharaoh down to the present period, and had been entailed 
through successive generations, their right to be free could 
never have been alienated, but their claims would have con- 
stantly risen in solemnity — That all those laws which are 
now in force, admitting the right of slavery, are therefore 
before God utterly null and void; being an audacious usur- 
pation of the Divine prerogative, a daring infringement on 
the law of .Nature, a base overtlu'ow of the very foundations 
of the social compact, a complete extinction of all the rela- 
tions, endearments, and obligations of mankind, and a pre- 
sumptuous transgression of all the holy commandivjents — and 
that therefore they ought to be instantly abrogated. 

We further believe and affirm — That all persons of col- 
or, who possess the qualifications which are demanded of 
others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of 
the same privileges, and the exercise oi' the same preroga- 
tives, as others — That the paths of preferment, of wealth, 
and of intelligence, should be opened as widely to them as 
to persons of a white complexion. 

rWe maintain that no compensation sliould be given to the 
planters emancipating their slaves — Because it would be a 
surrender of the great fundamental principle, that man can- 
not hold property in man — Because Slavery is a crime, 

AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT AN ARTICLE TO BE SOLD 

Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of 
what they claim; freeing the slaves is not depriving them of 
property, but restoring it to its right ov\'ners; it is not 
wronging the master, but righting the slave— restoring him 
to himself — Because immediate and general emancipation 
would only destroj nominal, not real property: it would not 



9 



amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but by in- 
fusing tnotives into their breasts, would make them duubly 
vakiable to the Piasters as /Vee hiborers: and, because, if 
compensation is to be given at ail, it should be given to the 
outraged and guihless shives, and not to those who have 
plundered and abused tliem. J 

We regard, as dehisive, cruel and dangerous, any scheme 
of expatriation whicli pretends to aid, either directly or in- 
directly, in the emancipation of the slaves, or to be a sub- 
atitiUe for the immediate and total abolition of slavery. 

We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of 
each State, to legislate exclusively on the subject of sl;ivcry 
which is tolerated within its limits; we concede that Con- 
gress, under the present itational compact, has no right to 
interfere with any of the slave States, in relation to this 
momentous subject. 

But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is sol- 
emnly bound, to suppress the domestic slave trade between 
the several States, and to abolish slavery in those portions 
of our territory which the Constitution has placed under its 
exclusive jurisdiction* 

We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the 
highest obligations resting upon the people of the free 
States, to remove slavery by moral and political action, as 
prescribed in the Constitution of ihe United Slates. They 
are now living under a pledge ot their tremendous physical 
force to fasten the galling letters of tyranny upon the limbs 
of millions in the Southern States; they are liable to be 
called at any moment to suppress a general insurrection of 
the slaves; they authorize the slave owner to vote for three- 
fifths of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to per- 
petuate his oppression; they support a standing army at the 
south for its protection ; and they seize the slave who has 
escaped into their territories, and send him back to be tor- 
tured by an enraged master or a brutal driver. This rela- 
tion to slavery is criminal and full of danger: it must be 

BROKEN UP. 

These are our views and principles — these, our designs 
and measures. With entire confidence in the over-ruling 
justice of God, we plant ourselves upon the Declaration of 
our Independence and the truths of Divine Revelation as 
upon the evj;klastixNG kock. 

We shall organize Anti-Slavery Societies, if possible, in 
every city, town, and village in our land. 

We shall senil forth Agents to lift up the voice of remon- 
strance, of warning, of entreaty, and of rebuke. 



10 



We sliall circulate, unsparingly and extensively, anti-slav- 
ery tracts and periodicals. 

We shall enlist the [lulpit and the press in the cause of 
the suffering and the dumb. 

We shall aim at a purification of the churches from all 
participation in the guilt of slavery. 

We shall encourage the hdjor of'freemen rather than that 
of the slaves, by giving a preference to their productions: 
and 

We shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole 
nation to speedy repentance. 

Our trust for victory is solely in GOD. We may be per- 
sonally defeated, but "our principles never. Truth, Jus- 
tice, Reason, Humanity, must and will gloriously tri- 
umph. Already a host is coming up to the help of the Lord 
against the mighty, and the prospect before us is full of en- 
couragement. 

Submitting this DECLARATION to the candid examin- 
ation of the people of this country, and of the friends of lib- 
erty throughout the worlil, we hereby affix our signatures to 
it; pledging ourselves that, under the guidance and by the 
help of Almighty God, we will do all that in us lies, consis- 
tently with this Declaration of our principles, to overthrow 
the most execrable system of slavery, that has ever been 
witnessed upon earth — to deliver our land from its deadliest 
curse — (o wipe out the foulest slain which rests upon our 
national escutcheon — and to secure to the colored population 
of the United States, all the rights and privileges which be- 
long to them as men, and as Americans— come what may to 
our persons, our interests, or our reputations — whether we 
live to witness the triumph of libkktt, justice and hu- 
manity, or perish untimely as martyrs in this great, be- 
nevolent, and holy cause.

CONSTITUTION 

OF THE 

AMEEICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, 

Art. II. The object of this Society is the entire aboli- 
tion of slavery in the United States. While it admits that 
each State in which slavery exists, has, by the Constitution 
of the United States, the exclusive right to legislate in re- 
gard to its abolition in said State, it shall aim to convince 
all our fellow-pitizens, by arguments addressed to their un- 
derstandings and consciences, that slaveholding is a heinous 
crime in the sight of God, and that the duty, safety, and 
best interests of all concerned, require its immediate ahan^ 
donment, without expatriation. The Society will also en- 
deavor, in a constitutional wav, to influence Congress to put 
an end to the domestic slave trade;<and to abolish slavery in 
all those portions of our cojnmon country which come under 
its control, especially in the District of Columbia, — and 
likewise to prevent the extension of it to any state that may 
be hereafter admitted to the Union. 

Art. III. This Society shall aim to elevate the charac- 
ter and condition of the people of color, by encouraging 
their intellectual, moral, and religious imprflvement, and by 
removing public prejudice, that thus they may, according to 
their intellectual and moral worth, share an equality with 
the whites, of civil and religious privileges; but this Socie- 
ty will never, in any way, countenance the oppressed in vin- 
dicating their rights by resorting to physical force. 

Art. IV. Any person who consents to the principles of 
this Constitution, who contributes to the funds of this Socie- 
ty, and is not a slaveholder, may be a member of this Socie- 
ty, and shall be entitled to vote at the meetings. 

[Articles 5, 6, and 7th relate to officers. Art. Sth fixes 
the ' annual meeting at such time and place as the Execu- 
tive Committee may direct,' &c.] 

Art. IX. Any Anti-Slavery Society, or association, 
founded on the same principles, may become auxiliary to this 
Society. The Oflicers of each Auxiliary Society shall be 
ex-officio members of the Parent Institution, and shall be 
entitled to deliberate and vote in the transaction of its con- 
cerns.

CONSTITUTION 

OF THE 

MASSACHUSETTS ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY. 

PREAMBLE. 

Wliereas, we believe that Slavery is contrary to the pre- 
cepts of Clu^isrianity, danj^erous to the liberties of the coun- 
try, and ongfct immediately to be abolished; and whereas, 
we believf that the citizens of Mass^husetts not only have 
the riglit tlHprotest against it, but are under the highest ob- 
ligation to seek its removal _ by a jigqral influence; and 
whereas, we believe that the fr^ji^. people of color are un- 
righteously oppressed, and stand in need of our sympathy and 



benevolent .C(^-operation ; therefore, recognizing the inspired 
declaration that God ' h'Atk madAif'one blood all nations of 
men for to dwell on all the -face-' f the earth,' and in obe- 



dience to our Savior's golden rule, * all things whatsoever ye 
would that men should dcv'to you, do ye even so to them;' 
we agree to form ourselves into a, Society, and to be govern- 
ed by the following

SF.TTS .Anti-Slavery Socikty, and shall be auxiliary to

their situation and rights, and oblain for them equal civil and 
political rights and privileges with the whites. 

Art. III. Any person by signing the Constitution, and ^ 
paying to the Treasurer fifteen dollars as a life subscription, ^
