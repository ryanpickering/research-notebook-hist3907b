isKed expensesofthe 




ciety, owing to the 
^rawjr^D^^cn^maramc^^^twui^i there be no larger contributions than were made last year. But we 
anticipate alnuch more abundant supply of means. 

We caauu/t, of course, within the limits of a lettersheet, indicate what our course will be, in all partic- 
ulars. It must be influenced by the ever changing aspects of the cause, and affected in some measure by 
the result of this application. The plan of sweeping over the country with a series of mass Conventions, 
we shall probably adopt as far as practicable, encouraged by the eminent success of those we have already 
tried. v All we can promise is, that we will endeavor to create as wide an agitation, and to bring home 
^ anti-slavery truth to as many minds, as the means committed to us will permit. We are willing to give 
tjj our tmie and labor gratuitously to the service of the slave and of his friends; but it is obvious that we are 
4 ^owe^ess, unless strongly sustained by the anti-slavery public. The object of this application is to ascer- 
n, in some degree, whether we can depend upon that support. 

The question resolves itself into one of confidence in us. If you feel confidence in our zeal, experience 

d fidelity, we feel assured that you will be willing to trust to our discretion in the expenditure of your 

nds> Your own readiness to perform your part in the work of the deliverance of the slave — to feel 

nd act^in some degree, as if your own parent, or sister, or wife, or child, were in a cruel captivity — we 

ill norullow ourselves to doubt. 

We(invite you, therefore, to contribute of your abundance, or of your penury, towards the accomplish- 
ment t>f the great work of this age and country — the emancipation of the American slave, who has been 
oo h&g retained in his chains, through our guilt and indifference. We would urge upon you to call 
gether the abolitionists of your neighborhood, and to lay this subject before them, and to ascertain what 
ey<2Jtend to do in this great matter. We entreat you to do what you find to do quickly, for a mighty 
ork is to be done, and the time is short, and the laborers are few. We beg of you to regard yourself, 
|>gethter with the most devoted friends in your neighborhood, as a financial Committee of the American 
SocietyT^nd to put yourselves in speedy and regular communication with us. Funds and pledges should 
e foAvarded, with all convenient speed, either to Francis Jackson, Treasurer, 27 State Street, Boston, 
r t^iDNEY H. Gay, Assistant. Treasurer, 162 Nassau Street, New York. 

Th|s circular will be sent to a considerable number of the best known of the members of the Society, 
ndJjJ a few who are not members, but who are believed to be strongly interested in its object, and who 
jveh^ie will be willing to assist us in its advancement. 

In the confident hope of a speedy and favorable response, we are, 

Your friends and fellow-laborers.
