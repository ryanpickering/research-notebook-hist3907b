FOR 



184T. 



BEING THE THIRD YEAR AFTER BISSEXTILE, OR LEAP YEAR. 

COMPRISING 

The motions of the Sim and Moon, the true places tind aspects of the PLANETS, rising 

and setting of the SUN, and the rising, setting, and southing of the MOON.— Also, 

th© Lunations, Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgment of the Weather, Rising 

and Setting of the Planets, LeDgth of Days and Nights, Time of 

High Water, Sec. be. 



My heart is sad as I contemplate thee, 

Thou fettered victim of despotic sway ; 

Driven, like a senseless brute, from day to day, 
Though equal born, and as thy tyrants free. 
With hands together clasped imploringly, 

And face upturned to Heaven (Heaven shall repay) ! 

For liberty and justice thou dost pray, 
In piteous accents and on bended knee, 
Thy exclamation, " Am I not a man ?" 

A brother ? " thrills my soul," I answer — Yes ! 
Though placed beneath an ignominious ban, 

That thou art both, all shall at last confess ! 
To rescue thee, incessantly I'll plan, 

And toil and plead thy injuries to redress. 

W. L. Garrison.

IMMEDIATE ABOLITION. 

BY W. L. GARRISON. 

Since the deception practised upon our first parents by the old ser- 
pent, there has not been a more fatal delusion hi the minds of men, 
than that of the gradual abolition of slavery. Gradual Abolition ! Do its 
supporters really know what they talk about ? Gradually abstaining 
from what ? From sins the most flagrant, from conduct the most cruel, 
from actions the most oppressive ! There is not a clergyman of any 
denomination, who would not be instantly ousted from his pulpit, 
were he to inculcate such advice. Do our gradualists mean that slave- 
dealers shall sell or purchase a few victims less this year than they 
did the last ? that slave-owners shall liberate one, two, or three out of 
every hundred slaves during the same period ? that slave-drivers shall j 
apply the lash to the scarred and bleeding backs of their victims some- 
what less frequently? Surely not. I respect their intelligence too 
much to believe that they mean any such thing. But if any of the 
slaves should be exempted from sale or purchase, why not all ? if jus- 
tice requires the liberation of the few, why not of the many I if it be 
right for a driver to inflict a number of lashes, how many shall be 
given? Do gradualists mean that the practice of separating the hus- 
band from the wife, the wife from the husband, or children from their 
parents, shall come to an end by an almost imperceptible process? 
or that the slaves shall be defrauded of their just remuneration, less 
and less every month or every year ? or that they shall be under the 
absolute irresponsible control of their masters ? Oh no ! I place a 
higher value upon their good sense and morality than this. Well, 
then, they would immediately break up the slave traffic — they would 
put aside the whip — they would have the marriage relations preserved 
inviolate — they would not separate families — they would not steal 
the wages of the slaves, nor deprive them of personal liberty. This 
is abolition — immediate abolition. It is simply declaring that slave 
owners are bound to fulfil, now, without any reluctance or delay, the 
golden rule, namely : to do as they would be done by; and that, as 
the right to be free is inherent and inalienable in the slaves, there 
ought now to be a disposition on the part of the people to break their 
fetters. All the horrid spectres which are conjured up, on this subject, 
arise from a confusion of the brain, as much as from a corruption of 
the heart. 

I hold this truth to be self-evident, that no transfer, or inheritance, 
or purchase, or sale, of stolen property, can convert it into just pos- 
session, or destroy the claim of its original owner, the maxim being 
universally conceded to be just, that the receiver is as bad as the 
thief. I utterly reject, as delusive and dangerous in the extreme, 
every plea which justifies a procrastinated and indefinite emancipa- 
tion, or which concedes to a slave owner the right to hold his slaves 
as property for any limited period, or which contends for the gradual 
preparation of the slaves for freedom ; believing all such pretexts to be 
a fatal departure from the high road of justice into the bogs of expe- 
diency, a surrender of the great principles of truth, an indefensible 
prolongation of the curse of slavery, a concession which places the 
guilt upon any but those who incur it, and directly calculated to per- 
petuate the thraldrom of our species. (Liberator, 1832.) 



THE DOMESTIC SLAVE TRADE. 

By the laws of the U. States, if a citizen of this government is con- 
victed of being engaged in the Foreign Slave Trade he is hung as a 
pirate. Let us see what sort of a trade that is which a man must be 
engaged in as a necessary qualification to the presidency of this en- 
lightened country. 

And first as to its extent. Between the years 1817, and 1837, a 
period of twenty years, 300,000 slaves were taken from Virginia, 
North Carolina, and Maryland, to the Southern market, according to 
the statement of the Rev. Dr. Graham, of North Carolina ; and in 
1835 it was estimated by the most intelligent men of Virginia, that 
120,000 slaves were exported from that State during the preceding 
twelve months. About two-thirds of these accompanied their own- 
ers, who removed ; the remaining one-third were sold at an average 
of $600 each, amounting to $24,000,000, which the domestic Slave- 
Trade poured into Virginia in one year. In 1836, says the Maryville 
(Tenn.) Intelligencer, " 60,000 slaves passed through a little western 
town on their way to the Southern market, and in the same year four 
States imported 200,000 slaves from the North." In 1837, a commit- 
tee appointed by the citizens of Mobile, Alabama, to inquire into the 
causes of pecuniary distress then prevalent, reported that between 
the years 1833 and 1837, Alabama alone imported from the Northern 
slave States, $10,000,000 worth of slaves annually, ammounting to 
$40,000,000 in four years. 

This gives us a fair idea of the extent to which the domestic trade 
in men, women, and children is carried on. Our masters have just 
annexed to the United States a territory half a dozen times as large 
as New York, for the express purpose of extending and perpetuating 
slavery, and this has given the trade a new impetus. The price of 
slaves rose at once hi the slave-trading states the moment it was 
known the annexation bill was passed. We are now at war with 
Mexico, to add still more territory to the accursed Union, and ex- 
tend the " peculiar institution" still farther south, and among a peo- 
ple who years ago abolished it. 

Now what is the character of this trade ? We will not give any 
testimony of abolitionists, though well enough authenticated evi- 
dence as to its shocking cruelty might be adduced to fill a volume. 
We prefer the southerners themselves as witnesses, and their testi- 
mony shall be recent. 

Niles' Register, published at Baltimore, vol. 35, p. 4, states that 
" dealing in slaves has become a large business — establishments are 
made in several places in Maryland and Virginia, at which they are 
sold like cattle. These places of deposit are strongly built, and well 
supplied with thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with cow- 
skins and other whips, oftentimes bloody /" 

The Maryville, (Tenn.) Intelligencer, of October 4th, 1835, speak- 
ing of these droves of human cattle, remarks : ** That they are driven 
with heavy galling chains riveted upon their persons, their backs 
lacerated with the knotted whip, travelling to a region where their 
condition throughout time will be second only to the wretched crea- 
tures in hell; this depicting is not visionary, would to God it was." 

The New Orleans Courier, of February 15, 1845, says, " We think 
it would require some casuistry to show, that the present Slave-Trade 
hi Virginia is a whit better than the one from Africa." 

f ~ • • - 



"The Presbyterian Synod of Kentucky, in 1835, in an address to 
the churches under its care, says : " Brothers and sisters, parents and 
children, husbands and wives, are separated, and permitted to see eacli 
other no more. These acts are daily occurring in the midst of us. 
The shrieks and agony often witnessed on such occasions, proclaim 
with a trumpet-tongue the iniquity of our system. There is not a 
neighborhood where these heart-rending scenes are not displayed. 
There is not a village or road that does not behold the sad procession 
of manacled outcasts, whose mournful countenances tell that they 
are exiled by force from all that their hearts hold dear." 

Remember now the thousands who according to the calculations 
of the Southerners themselves are annually bartered and sold, and 
remember the condition which Southerners also declare to be that of 
these thousands, and our readers can form some idea of the Domestic i 
Slave Trade of the United States. 



FREE SUFFRAGE. 

" Ain't thee going to vote for giving the Right of Suffrage to the 
colored people," said a young Friend to one of the progressive De- 
mocrats of this city, about the time of the Convention election." 

" Damn the Niggers ! No," replied the advocate of principles which 
Secretary Bancroft calls " practical Christianity." 

" But why not. Don't thee believe that ALL men are born free 
and equal ? Is'nt that thy creed ?" 

" To be sure it is. That's in our glorious Declaration of Independ- 
ence. But it don't say nothing about niggers. They hav'nt got the 
nat'rel right, and besides they do'nt know enough." 

" Well, Friend, there's a letter in this morning's Tribune from one 
of them niggers, as thee calls them, which I wish thee would read. 
And I should like to know what thee thinks of it sometime." 

The letter he referred to was one from Frederick Douglass, written 
to the Liberator and re-published in the Tribune. The next day the 
two happened to meet again. 

" Well Friend, has thee read that letter ?" said the Quaker. 

" I rather guess I have," replied the other. 

" And what does thee think of it ?" 

" Well, it's what I call a pretty damned smart letter." 

11 1 think," said the Friend, " that I should'nt be afraid to offer thee 
Fifty Dollars to find a democrat in our ward, who could write a better." 

■ I should'nt take you up," said the other. 

" 1 hope then thee's changed thy mind, and means to vote for the 
colored suffrage, in spite of party." 

"1 don't know about that, it won't do to go agin the party." 

" What, not if the party's wrong ?" 

" Well, you see party is party, and it don't do to go agin it, if you 
mean to keep it a party." " But look here, neighbor, I'll tell you 
what it is, if I can't vote to let the niggers go to the polls, if Fred 
Douglass was here, and was up for anything, I tell you what, I'd vote 
for that nigger !" 



MORAL AND POLITICAL POWER. 

'What do you, expect to accomplish," says my neighbor Joalv 
" with your moral power, moral suasion, or whatever else you call 
it? Do you expect to put down intemperance, free the slaves, sup- 
press crime, and set the whole world in order, by writing printing, 
preaching, singing, talking, setting good examples, disfellowshipping 
evil-doers, and such like IV Why not, neigbor Joab ? " Because it 
is of no use. Those things are necessary in their place, but what. are 
J they good for without political power ? We must go the Ballot-box, 
the Jury-box, the Criminal's box, and, if needs be, to the Cartridge-box. 
These are the things to do up the work. 1 have no faith in this non- 
I voting, non-prosecuting, uon-punishing, all-talk-and-do-nothing 
I theory. Mankind must be candidly and kindly told what their duty 
lis, and if they will not do it, they must be made to do it. That is my' 
j doctrine." 

Neighbor Joab is a great believer in human government. He goes 
for political and legal coercion. He worships political power. Moral 
power is of little account with him. He does not absolutely despise 
jit, but it seems to him good for nothing without political power. In 
| this he is not singular; the multitude think and feel just so. Let us 
try to enlighten them. Neighbor Joab, moral power is as much 
superior to political power, as the sun is to the moon. You see 
things inverted. Moral power is as ancient as God, and as vast as 
the universe. Political power is certainly not older than human 
governments, nor more extensive. Political power is just that power 
which a nation, state, or body politic exercises when it compels men 
to obey its requirements by an application, or, at least, a threat of phy- 
sical coercion. This narrows down political power to a mere line. 
But moral power comprehends every description of power, which 
(without applying or threatening physical coercion) tends to determine 
the will, conduct, and character of rational beings. Moral power 
is, therefore, eternal, universal, omnipresent, and almost omnipotent. 
Political power could not exist but by favor of moral power. It can 
do nothing without the preparative and sustaining influence of moral 
power. It claims the credit of much that moral power has done at 
its own expense. Nine-tenths of the best things done in the name 
and to the credit of the government, have been originated and ma- 
tured by moral power. Moral power does all the persuading ; politi- 
cal power only the driving. Political power makes war, trains the 
, militia, punishes criminals, and uses up the people's money — earning 
j less and demanding better pay than almost any other agency in the 
conduct of human affairs. Moral power works out the most com- 
plex, difficult, and mighty results by long years of unpaid and! 
unthanked toil. It accomplishes everything for nothing. The minis 
iters of moral power are the world's most self sacrificing servants, and j 
| are often worn up and left to starve, while the ministers of political 
power waste enough in luxury to feed and clothe twice their number, j 

Neighbor Joab, please tell us whether women exert any political 
influence on human affairs ! Yet they have no political power. 
Please tell us whether persons under age, and the multitudes of men 
who are excluded from the ballot-box, exert any influence ! Tell us 
whether education, religion, and ten thousand elements of moral 
power, exert any control over the condition of mankind ? Tell us 
whether Jesus Christ, his apostles and primitive followers for the 



I first two or three centuries, when they were continually persecuted 
by political power, accomplished anything? Tell us whether politi- 

"ight the new 

Western World, gave us the steam engine, &.c, &c. Tell us whether 
political power originated, and sustained in their infancy, the Tern- j 
perance Reform, the Anti-Slavery Cause, &c. Tell us what great \ 
and glorious improvement political power ever originated or even j 
patronized till after it could live by the favor of public opinion. In 
fine, tell us what great things have been, or can be done, by the 
ballot-box, the jury-box, the criminal's box, or the cartridge-box, 
without and against public opinion ? Political power is controlled 
by public opinion, and public opinion is the creature of moral power. 
Therefore, when wise and good men wish to control political power 
without touching it, they have only to exert their united energies in 
the use of moral power for the creation of a right public opinion, 
this will turn political power which way they will, as the wind con- 
trols the weathercock. They govern the world who govern public 
opinion. 

But says my neighbor Joab, " why should not wise and good men 
use political as well as moral power in a good cause ?"' They may, 
when they can do it without sin. If the end, the means, and the spirit 
are all good, they may use political power. But if the end is bad, or 
the means bad, or the spirit of action bad, they must not defile them- 
selves. They need not, and they must not. All the good they seek is 
otherwise attainable without evil. They must not do evil that good 
may come. They must "have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
| works of darkness, but rather reprove therein." This is the law for 
wise and good men. 

Now for the improvement. If the Constitution of the American 
Union tolerates, sanctions, and sustains slavery ; if it forbade the 
nation to abolish the slave-trade for a certain number of years ; if it 
gave slaveholders greater weight than others in the Electoral and 
Legislative branches of government, proportionate to the number of 
their unfortunate victims; if it bound the whole people to deliver up 
fugitive slaves to their claimants; if it pledged to the slaveholders mili- 
tary assistance to keep their slaves in subjection ; if all this has been, 
and still is, the practice under this government ; and if every man 
who makes himself a voter, necessarily assumes the covenant and 
obligations of a citizen to support the Constitution, or if the candidate ;| 
he votes for must swear to support it; then can no man who truly 1 
abhors slaveholding as a sin under all circumstance? innocently accept 
office, or assist in electing any other person to office under the Fede- 
ral government. Political power, under such a Constitution and such 
a government, is power exercised to hold millions of slaves by brute 
force, in a " bondage, a moment of which, is worse than whole ages" 
of that which the revolutionary founders of this nation rose in rebellion 
to r,esist. Whoever abhors slave-stealing from principle, must abhor 
slave-trading, slave-holding, and slave-breeding, together with 
governmental slave-wathcing, slave-threatening, slave-keeping, and 
slave-crushing. It is all of a piece from beginning to end. A man 
who means to keep his slaves in bondage and to take part only with 
their masters, is in principle no better than the masters, who are in 
principle no better than the first man-stealers, who, according to the 
divine law, are in principle no better than murderers. 



If neighbor Joab, or any other man, professes to abhor slavehold- 
ing with all his heart, does not abhor a compact, which holds three 
millions of human beings under the power of oppression, let him 
suspect that he deceives himself. Let him know that he assassinates 
his anti-slavery principles by a voluntary union and participation m 
such a government with slaveholders. And if, through any unac- 
countable idolatry of political power, he continues this political 
union with slave-holders, let him know that he is fighting against 
humanity and against God, only to involve himself in the " plagues" 
and overthrow of that great Babylon from which it is the mandate 
of heaven, and his first duty, to " come out" forth with and for ever. 

A din Ballou. 

I'VE NO INFLUENCE. 

What if the little rain should say, 

" So small a drop as I, 
Can ne'er refresh those thirsty fields, 

I'll tarry in the sky ?" . 

What if a shining beam of noon 

Should in its fountain stay, 
Because its feeble light alone, 

Cannot create a day ? 

Doth not each rain- drop help to form 

The cool, refreshing showers, 
And every ray of light, to warm 

And beautify the flowers ? 



The New York Tribune, of a few months since, gives the following extract 
from a private letter to a gentleman in this city. The fact had been mentioned 
in a previous letter, but one of the gentlemen here expressing some doubt about 
it, these further particulars were given : 

" You state that you have your doubts about the killing of the negro slave. 
I will give you the facts as I have heard them. A person named Herb came 
home on Christmas morning at about two o'clock, and, on entering the house 
(he being intoxicated at the time), called for his private slave ( Fortune,' who 
had been ordered to sit up and wait till his master came home. He, however, 
had fallen asleep on the table, and the master was let in by another slave. The 
master inquired for ' Fortune,' and, on being told where he was, immediately 
rushed into the room and stabbed him with a bowie knife three or four times, 
and afterward dragged him off the table and kicked him. The house was by 
this time aroused and the negro picked up by one of his fellow slaves, who told 
his master that ' Fortune ' was dying. Herb then went for a doctor, but before 
he arrived the slave was a corpse. As Mr. Herb was sorry for what he had 
clone, as his going for a doctor proved, and the slave was his own private pro- 
perty, nothing was done to him — it was not even mentioned in the pidAic papers. 
As to the truth of the story — I was not a witness to the killing, but I believe the 
story nevertheless ; having heard it from respectable and responsible persons." 



No ! as a laborer, I plead not for the poor ; but I do mourn that the lamp of 
his soul should go out — that no bright visions should visit him; and that his 
mind through the whole of life should be filled with two great spectres — fear and 
indignation. Oh ! that one man should die ignorant, who had a capacity for 
knowledge, should make us all weep! — Carlyle. 



THE "CONNECTING LINK." 

When men cannot meet the arguments of abolitionists in favor 
of immediate and unconditional emancipation, they resort to abuse. 
Appealing to the vulgar prejudice against colored people, they declare 
that the negro is only the " connecting link between man and the 
monkey." Even were there any physiological truth in this ridiculous 
position, it would by no means follow that there were any moral 
truth in it. Nobody pretends that a white man has not a full right to 
the fruits of his own labor and to the rights of a husband and father ; to 
the privilege of gaining his own subsistence, and the power of fulfilling 
the common duties of a good citizen, because he may not possess the 
faculty of being a good Latin and Greek scholar, a good chemist, a 
good painter or sculptor. A large proportion of the white people 
of this country can neither read nor write; Calhoun and Mc'Duffie 
don't therefore make slaves of them. " What is sauce for the goose 
is sauce for the gander." If a white man's right to freedom may 
not be infringed upon, though he be not intelligent ; neither should a 
black man be deprived of his liberty, because some white man hap- 
pens to know more than he does. To maintain the contrary is to 
uphold the old doctrine of all tyrants, that the people are only fit to 
be governed by a few self- elected rulers. 

Give the negro a chance and he will prove that he has intelligence 
enough to be a freeman, and can take better care of himself than he 
does now when he has to support both himself and his master. 

Here is a letter from one of those " links," which was published a 
few months since in the Boston Liberator. The writer, some six or 
seven years ago, was hoeingcorn on a southern plantation. He thought 
he could take care of himself and so ran away. For five years past 
he has been lecturing on American Slavery, and is now traveling in 
Great Britain for that purpose, as an agent of the American Anti- 
Slavery Society. He gains universal admiration for his eloquence, and 
universal respect for his unblemished character. He has written a 
narrative of his own life while a slave, and if any white man believes 
him a " link" between himself and the monkey, he had better read 
it, to improve his knowledge of this branch of natural history. 

LETTERS FROM FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 

Victoria Hotel, Belfast, ) 
January 1st, 18-46. $ 

Mr Dear Friend Garrison : 

I am now about to take leave of the Emerald Isle, for Glasgow, 
Scotland. I have been here a little more than four months. Up to 
this time, I have given no direct expression of the views, feelings, 
and opinions which I have formed respecting the character and con- 
dition of the people of this land. I have refrained thus purposely. 
I wish to speak advisedly, and in order to do this, I have waited till 
I trust experience has brought my opinions to an intelligent ma- 
turity. I have been thus careful, not because I think what I may say 
will have much effect in shaping the opinion of the world, but be- 
cause whatever of influence I may possess, whether little or much, I 
wish it to go in the right direction, and according to truth. I hardly 
need say, that, in speaking of Ireland, I shall be influenced by no 
prejudices in favor of America. I think my circumstances all forbid 



that. I have no end to serve, no creed to uphold, no government to 
defend ; and as a nation I belong to none. I have no protection at 
home, or resting-place abroad. The land of my birth welcomes me 
to her shores only as a slave, and spurns with contempt the idea of 
treating me differently. So that I am an outcast from the society of 
my childhood, and an outlaw from the land of my birth. " 1 am a 
stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were." That 
men should be patriotic is to me perfectly natural ; and as a philo- 
sophical fact, I am able to give it an intellectual recognition. . But no 
further can I go. If ever I had any patriotism, or any capacity for 
the feeling, it was whipt out of me long since by the lash of the 
American soul- drivers. 

In thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her 
bright blue sky — her grand old woods — her fertile fields — her beautiful 
rivers — her mighty lakes, and star-crowned mountains. But my rap- 
ture is soon checked, my joy is soon turned into mourning. When I 
remember that all is cursed with the infernal spirit of slaveholding, 
robbery and wrong, — when I remember that with the waters of her 
noblest rivers, the tears of my brethren are borne to the ocean, dis- 
regarded and forgotten, and that her most, fertile fields drink daily of 
i the warm blood of my outraged sisters, I am filled with unutterable 
loathing, and led to reproach myself that anything could fall from my 
lips in praise of such a land. America will not allow her children to 
love her. She seems bent on compelling those who would be her 
warmest friends, to be her worst enemies. May God give her repen- 
tance before it is too late, is the ardent prayer of my heart. I will 
continue to pray, labor and wait, believing that she cannot always be 
insensible to the dictates of justice, or deaf to the voice of humanity. I 

My opportunities for learning the character and condition of the | 
people of this land have been very great. I have travelled almost j 
from the hill of " Howth," to the Giant's Causeway, and from the ! 
Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear. During these travels, I have met j 
with much in the character and condition of the people to approve, I 
and much to condemn — much that has thrilled me with pleasure — 
and very much that has filled me with pain. I will not in this letter, j 
attempt to give any description of those scenes which have given me j 
pain. This I will do hereafter. 1 have enough, and more than your 
subscribers will be disposed to read at one time, of the bright side of 
the picture. I can truly say, I have spent some of the happiest 
moments of my life since landing in this country. I seem to have 
undergone a transformation. I live a new life. The warm and gen- 
erous co-operation extended to me by the friends of my despised 
race— the prompt and liberal manner in which the press has rendered 
me its aid — the glorious enthusiasm with which thousands have 
flocked to hear the cruel Wrongs of my down-trodden and long-en- 
slaved fellow-countrymen portrayed— the deep sympathy for the 
slave, and the strong abhorrence of the slaveholder, everywhere 
evinced — the cordiality with which members and ministers of various 
religious bodies, and of various shades of religious opinion, have em- 
braced me, and lent me their aid— the kind hospitality constantly 
proffered to me by persons of the highest rank in society — the spirit 
of freedom that seems to animate all with whom I come in contact 
— and the entire absence of everything that looked like prejudice 
against me, on account of the color of my skin— contrasted "so 
strongly with my long and bitter experience in the United States, that 



I look with wonder and amazement on the transition. In the South- 
ern part of the United States, I was a slave, thought of, spoken of, as 
property. In the language of the LAW, " held, taken, reputed and 
adjudged to be a chattel in the hands of my owners and possessors, and 
their executors, administrators, and assigns, to all intents, constructions, 
and purposes whatsoever" — Biiev. Digest, 224. In the Northern States, 
a fugitive slave, liable to be hunted at any moment like a felon, and 
to be hurled into the terrible jaws of slavery — doomed by an invet- 
erate prejudice against color to insult and outrage on every hand, 
(Massachusetts out of the question) — denied the privileges and cour- 
tesies common to others in the use of the most humble means of 
conveyance — shut out from the cabins on steamboats — refused ad- 
| mission to respectable hotels — caricatured, scorned, scoffed, mocked 
| and maltreated with impunity by any one, (no matter how black his 
heart,) so he has a white skin. But now behold the change ! Eleven 
days and a half gone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of 
the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under 
a monarchical government. Instead of the bright blue sky of Amer- 
ica, I am covered with the soft grey fog of the Emerald Isle. I 
breathe, and lo ! the chattel becomes a man. I gaze around in vain 
for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or 
offer me an insult. I employ a cab — I am seated beside white people 
j — I reach the hotel — 1 enter the same door — I am shown into the 
J same parlor — I dine at the same table — and no one is offended. No 
delicate nose grows deformed in my presence I find no difficulty here 
in obtaining admission into any place of worship, instruction or 
amusement, on equal terms with people as wjhite as any I ever saw 
[ in the United States. I meet nothing to remind me of my complexion. 
I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness 
and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am met 
by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, " We don't allow niggers 
in here /" 

I remember, about, two years ago, there was in Boston, near the 
southwest corner of Boston Common, a menagerie. I had long de- 
sired to see such a collection as I understood was being exhibited j 
there. Never having had an opportunity while a slave, I resolved to j 
seize this, my first, since my escape. I went, and as I approached j 
the entrance to gain admission, I was met and told by the door- J 
keeper, in a harsh and contemptuous tone, " We don't allow niggers 
in here.'" I also remember attending a revival meeting in the Rev. 
Henry Jackson's meeting-house, at New-Bedford, and going up the 
broad aisle to final a seat. I was met by a good deacon, who told 
me, in a pious tone, " We don't allow niggers inhere/" Soon after my 
arrival in New Bedford from the South, I had a strong desire to at- 
tend the Lyceum, but was told, " They don't allou niggers in here /" 
While passing from New York to Boston on the steamer Massachusetts, 
OH the night of 9th December, 1843, when chilled almost through with 
the cold, I went into the cabin to get a little warm. I was soon 
touched upon the shoulder, and told, " We don't allow niggers inhere/" 
On arriving in Boston from an anti-slavery tour, hungry and tired, I 
went into an eating-house near my friend Campbell's, to get some 
refreshments. I was met by a lad hi a white apron, " We don't allow 
niggers in here .'" A week or two before leaving the United States, I 
had a meeting appointed at Weymouth, the home of that glorious 
band of true abolitionists, the Weston family, and others On at- 



tempting to take a seat in the Omnibus to that place, I was told by 
the driver, (and I never shall forget his fiendish hate,) " I don't allow 
niggers in here /" Thank heaven for the respite I now enjoy ! I had 
been in Dublin but a few days, when a gentleman of great re- j 
spectability kindly offered to conduct me through all the public build- 
ings of that beautiful city; and a little afterwards, I found myself 
dining with the Lord Mayor of Dublin. What a pity there was not 
some American democratic Christian at the door of his splendid 
mansion, to bark out at my approach, " We don't allow niggers in here/" 
The truth is, the j>eople here know nothing of the republican negro 
hate prevalent in our glorious land. They measure and esteem men 
according to their moral and intellectual worth, and not according to 
the color of their skin. Whatever may be said of the aristocracies 
here, there is none based on the color of a man's skin. This species 
of aristocracy belongs pre-eminently to " the land of the free and the 
home of the brave." I have never found it abroad in any but Ameri- 
cans. It sticks to them wherever they go. They find it almost as 
hard to get rid of it as to get rid of their skins. 

The second day after my arrival at Liverpool, in company with my 
friend Buffum, aud several other friends, I went to Eaton Hall, the 
residence of the Marquis of Westminster, one of the most splendid 
buildings in England. On approaching the door, I found several of 
our American passengers, who came with us in the Cambria, waiting 
at the door for admission, as but one party was allowed in the house 
at a time. We all had to wait till the company within came out. 
And of all the faces, expressive of chagrin, those of the Americans 
were pre-eminent. They looked as sour as vinegar, and bitter as 
gall, when they found I was to be admitted on equal terms with them- 
selves. When the door was opened, T walked in, on an equal footing 
with my white fellow-citizens, and from all I could see, I had as 
much attention paid me by the servants that showed us through 
the house, as any with a paler skin. As I walked through the build- 
ing, the statuary did not fall down, the pictures did not leap from 
their places, the doors did not refuse to open, and the servants did 
not say, " We don't allow niggers in here .'" 

A happy New Year to you and all the friends of freedom. 

Excuse this imperfect scrawl, and believe me to be ever and 
always yours, FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 



Here are two little poems worth reading. They are taken from a volume 
which was published in Raleigh, N. C. in 1829, and re-published again in 
Philadelphia in 1837. The writer is, or was a slave, at the time the volume 
was issued, who has no other name than George. He is called the property of 
one James Horton, Chatham County, N. C. The first edition of his poems 
was published to raise money to purchase George, and send him to Liberia, as 
his emancipation would not be consented to on any other terms than his banish- 
ment. The writer of the preface says : — 

" He had ever been a faithful, honest and industrious slave ; that his heart 
had felt deeply and sensitively in this lowest possible condition of human na- 
ture, would easily be believed, and was impressively confirmed by one of his 
stanzas : 

" Come melting pity from afar, 
And break this vast enormous bar 
Between a wretch .and thee ; 



Purchase a few short days of time, 
And bid a vassal soar sublime 
On wings of liberty." 

On the publication of the second edition, George was still a slave. It is such 
men as he and Frederick Douglass who are declared to be the "connecting 
Jnk," and unable " to take care of themselves." Reader, what do you think 
of it? 

ON THE DEATH OF REBECCA. 

" Thou delicate blossom ! thy short race is ended, 
Thou sample of virtue and prize of the brave ! 
No more are thy beauties by mortals attended, 
They are now but food for the worms and the grave. 

* 

Thou art gone to the tomb, whence there's no returning 

And left us behind in a vale of suspense ; 
In vain to the dust do we follow thee mourning, 

The same doleful trump will soon call us all hence. 

I view thee now launched on eternity's ocean, 
Thy soul how it smiles as it floats on the wave ; 

It smiles as if filled with the softest emotion, 

But looks not behind on the frowns of the grave. 

The messenger came from afar to relieve thee — 
In this lonesome valley no more shalt thou roam ; 

Bright Seraphs now stand on the banks to receive thee, 
And cry, ' Happy stranger, thou art welcome at home.' 

Thou art gone to a feast, while thy friends are bewailing, 
Oh, death is a song to the poor ransom'd slave ; 

Away with bright visions the spirit goes sailing, 
And leaves the frail body to rest in the grave. 

Rebecca is free from the pains of oppression, 
No friends could prevail on her longer to stay ; 

She smiles on the fields of eternal fruition, 
Whilst death like a bridegroom attends her away. 

She is gone in the whirlwind — ye seraphs attend her, 
Through Jordan's cold torrent her mantle may lave ; 

She soars in the chariot, and earth falls beneath her, 
Resign'd in a shroud to a peaceable grave." 

THE SLAVE'S COMPLAINT. 
'Am I sadly cast aside Something still my heart surveys 

On misfortune's rugged tide ? Groping through this dreary maze; 

Will the world my pains deride Is it hope ? then burn and blaze 

Forever 1 ? Forever. 

Must I dwell in slavery's night Leave me not a wretch confined, 

And all pleasure take its flight Altogether lame and blind, 

Far beyond my feeble sight Unto gross despair consigned . 
Forever? Forever. 

Worst of all, must hope grow dim Heaven! in whom can I confide ? . 

And withhold her cheering beam ? Canst thou not for all provide ? 

Rather let me sleep and dream Condescend to be my guide 
Forever? Forever. 

And when this transient life shall end 
Oh may some kind eternal friend 
Bid me from servitude ascend 
Forever. 



THE " PECULIAR INSTITUTION, 

The Southerners are very proud of calling the system of Slavery the u Pe- 
culiar Institution.' 1 Thank Heaven it is peculiar to them, "We trust the i| 
Northerners will never desire to share in their pride, and that the day is not far I 
distant when the southerners themselves will count' it as their shame. Its pecu- % 
liarity consists in this,— that it outrages every precept of Christianity, tramples j 
under foot all the rights of man, and disregards all the dictates of humanity.- It :1 
is a system of murder, robbery, and lust. There is no crime which man can | 
perpetrate against his brother man that is not included in its terrible catalogue. % 
Nor is this true as regards the slave only. The master is no less the victim, though j | 
in a different way, of the social system with which he is surrounded. Bred in the I 
spirit of violence and tyranny towards his menials, he exercises them towards j I 
his equals, and the bowie-knife and pistol are his first argument and last resort. I 

We might fill hundreds of volumes with facts that cannot be gainsaid as to | 
the peculiarities of the Southern Institution. We give a few taken at ran^k 
dom from the publications of the last year or two. Tbey are not the most at^ || 
rocious, and they are but a very small part of the multitude that lie ready to j 
our hands ; but they are all we have room for, and enough to convince any 
candid mind that a svstem which can have such features is all that we have 
said of it. 

It is proper to remark that nearly all this evidence comes from sources not 
professedly anti-Slavery in our sense of that term. 

The following is cut from a St. Louis paper, in which it appears as an ad- ; 
vertisement. 

" Lost Child. — Came to the brick house, corner of Third and Elm streets, ! 
about nine o'clock, night before last, a black female CHILD, about seven or | 
eight years of age. That its anxious and humane owner may find it, I describe 
it — a good-looking child, marked and branded on its head, face, nose, ears, lips, 
chin, neck, breast, back, sides, shoulders, arms, hands and fingers, hips, thighs,] 
knees, legs, ancles, feet, heels and toes — by what appears to have been the cow- • 
hide, or some other humane instrument. If not called for soon, it will be turn- j 
ed over to the court, to be dealt with as the law directs. S." 

June 18, 1845. 

A Southern paper of a few months since advertises as follows : 

NecxEO Dogs. — The undersigned, having bought the entire pack of Negro 
Dogs, (of the Hays & Allen stock,) he now proposes to catch runaway negroes. ; 
His charges will be three dollars per day for hunting, and fifteen dollars for 
catching a runaway. He resides three and a half miles north of Livingston, ! 
near the lower Jones' Bluff road. WILLIAM GAMBREL. ! 

Nov. 6, 1845— 6m. 

Read the following account from the New Orleans Picayune, of a scene that ! 
occurred in the streets of that city in broad da5 r -light not long since. 

" Cruelty. — Passing through Baronne street about noon yesterday, a crowd, 
composed of men, women, and children, attracted our attention. The object of 
their curiosity — or rather their pity — we found to be a delicate, debilitated-look- j 
ing mulatto boy, about ten years old. An old negro on one side and a stick on 
the other supported him, as he endeavored to move along, though it was evi- 1 
dent that any motion, however slow, was too much for his prostrate physi- ; 
cal powers. 

"We inquired what was the matter with the boy, and were answered by his 
shirt being raised up off his back, and heavens! Iioav expressive of fiendish 
cruelty was the spectacle that presented itself! The poor boy's back and body ; 
were one mass of raw, trembling, skinless, parti-putrid, lacerated flesh ! Ra- 
vines, as it were, in his carcase, had been cut by the lash, and he appeared, al- 
together, a victim of the most wanton and heartless cruelty which it was possi- i 
ble for other tha 1 a fiend to inflict. All we could learn of this monstrous cruelty | 
we had from the old negro who helped the boy along; we give it for what it is | 
worth, premising that we shall seek for the authentic facts of the case and lay j 
them before the public. 

The old negro said that he and the boy belonged to C. Donniburg, who lives | 



at the corner of Annunciation and Richard streets , that Donniburg lost a watch, 
I and charged the boy with stealing it, Some ten or fourteen days since he had 
> him put in the police jail of the First Municipality, and there, by Ms order, says 
| the old man, was the inhuman punishment inflicted on him. The boy himself 
j says that he received twenty-five lashes a day from the day he Was imprisoned, 
[ till Thursday last, The old man, by direction of his master, was taking him 
j home; but two citizens, seeing that he must die by the way, informed Recorder 
I Baldwin of his condition, who promptly had him brought to the police office, 
j where he was examined by Di\ Pieton. 

As the doctor examined the wounds, they were necessarily exposed to the 
| bystanders, who, by an involuntary exclamation, expressed their indignation 
• against his torturer. The doctor pronounced the boy in a precarious condition, 
' but said that by proper treatment he might recover, and advised that he should 
be sent to the Charity Hospital. The Recorder ordered that he be at once taken 
there, and thither was he carried by the police, on a litter— his back upward." 

The Selma Free Press, not long since, contained the following advertisement. 
Think of the ingratitude of this slave in running away. He ought to have been 
" contented and happy :" 

"#25 REWARD. — Absconded from the subscriber's plantation, near Benton, 
Alabama, on the 18th of September last, a negro man named NED. He is very 
black.-ordinary height, say five and a half feet; is branded on the forehead with 
tJie letters A. M. arid on, each cheek with the letters J. G. The former he probably 
conceals by allowing his hair to cover it, and the latter are concealed by whiskers, 
and an examination may be necessary to discover them. As he will doubtless re- 
fuse to disclose his real owner's name, these brands are sufficient to identify him. 

I will pay the above reward of twenty -five dollars for apprehending and lodg- 
ing him in any jail, so that I can get him, and giving me information of the 
same at Selma, Alabama ; and a reasonable additional reward will be paid, if 
! delivered to me, or to Mr. R. A. Nicoli,, of Mobile. 

ANTHONY M. M1NTER. 



The Rev, Dr. Babcock of a Baptist Church, we believe of Baltimore, thus 
describes a colored preacher whom he met in Montgomery, Alabama. 

" The afternoon of the Lord's day is uniformly devoted to the benefit of the 

colored congregation, who attended with interest and pleasure, and listened to a 

: sermon by one of their own race. Caesar, the speaker on this occasion is a 

middle-aged man, of ordinary height, spare, and somewhat bent in form, with 

| pleasant countenance, voice, and manner, and sometimes really eloquent. On 

this occasion he delivered a plain instructive discourse apparently well adapted 

: to the occasion. At the close of it, they allowed a brief appeal in behalf of the 

: Bible cause, to which they liberally contributed. Then came the conference of 

j the colored church members, and the examination of candidates for Baptism. 

: This was conducted principally by Caesar, in conjunction with the pastor and 

; clerk of the white church, of which all these descendants of Africa are mera- 

; bars. * * * The opening address of Coesar to these candidates 

; argued well in this respect. He seemed to understand that he was dealing with 

j unlettered, imaginative, impulsive beings, and he cautioned them accordingly. 

I * Don't tell us about dreams, visions, voices, and such like, but let us know how 

I you have regarded 3 r ourselves, how you felt, and how your character appeared 

; before God. Then tell us how you were led to hope", and on what you rely.' j 

In brief, we may say, that both the examiner, and the candidates before him 

gave pleasing evidence that they were taught of the Lord." 

Now, reader, what do you suppose this intelligent minister of the gospel is 1 
Hear the Doctor further : 

" Caesar is still a slave; and what is very peculiar, his ownership is now 
vested in the association of which this church is a member ! ! ! He is con- 
stantly employed by them, in ministerial and missionary labor, and God greatly 
blesses his efforts. Would to Heaven that all of us who have been bought with 
an infinite price, and profess that we are not our own, might serve our better 
Master as faithfully as this humble but devoted minister !" 



Mr. Selby, a Wesleyan Methodist clergyman, relates in a M.ethodist paper 
under date of Cambridge. Ohio, Feb, I84G, the following facts: 

" There is a colored man living within the bounds of my field of labor, 

(Leesburgh District,) who, according to his free papers, is one hundred and 

I fourteen ) r ears old ; he was a slave until he was seventy j-'ears old, at Which 

I time he was bought by his present wife's -father for four ntiridVed dollars. Dur- 

s ing his stay in Slavery he was the subject of very cruel treatment, he was often 

1 severely flogged, the truth of which his back fully exhibits, in being perfectly 

callous and white, from his neck to his hee'Is. During his abode in Slavery he 

was also the husband of four wives, one of whom was sold with her children 

to the far South, no more to be embraced by their husband and father ; another 

died in child-bed from exposure, her only accommodation being a little straw on 

the ground in a cold hut : another was whipped in the afternoon, and in the 

night was delivered of a child, and next morning died with het child also; 

they were shrouded with some kind of clothes, a hole was dug in the earth, 

and mother and child were thrown in together, and covered up with as little 

ceremony as of if they had been hogs/' 

* * * " * * * * * * * * * * 

" The man alluded to above, relates the following. He being what is gen- 
erally termed a house servant, had frequently to prepare milk today or egg-nogg, 
for whipping occasions ; one morning he was ordered to prepare some drink, 
and bring it, with a stand, and necessary vessels, to the shade of a large oak. 
He did as he was bid. and found in the shade his master and another' slave- j 
owner ; soon one of the plantation slaves was called by the master, and soon 
made his appearance near the place of blood, but when he saw the company, 
the drink, and other things, his heart failed, and he retreated, and sought refuge 
in a pond of water that was hard by. But alas, he was pursued by the demons 
in human shape, who commanded him to surrender and come forth. He re- 
fused j a musket was sent for and brought. He was then told that he would be 
called three times, and if he did not come forth he would be shot down ; he was 
called once, twice, three times, he refused to yield, his master raised his musket, 
took deliberate aim and fired ; the poor slave bounded up, fell back, and sunk to 
rise no more. Blood, blood, blood, crieth to God from the pond, for the poor 
slave's blood mixed with the water and turned it a crimson color for several 
yards around." 

The Rev. Mr. Boucher, a Methodist minister, related at a public meeting in 
Cincinnati a most revolting instance of inhumanity and hypocrisy which oc- 
curred under his own observation. 

" While he was on the Alabama Circuit, he spent a Sabbath with an old 
circuit preacher, who was also a doctor, living near the ' Horse Shoe,' celebrat- 
ed as Gen. Jackson's battle ground. Early Monday morning, he was- reading 
Pope's Messiah to Mr. Boucher, when his wife called him out. Mr. Boucher 
glanced his eye out of the window, and saw a slave man standing by, and the 
husband and wife consulting over him. Presently the doctor took a raw-hide 
from under his coat, and began to cut up the half-naked back of the slave. 
Several inches of the skin turned up, perfectly white, at every stroke, until the 
whole back was red with gore. At first, the lacerated man cried out in his ago- 
ny, at which the Doctor and Divine cried out at every stroke, ' Won't ye 
hush ! Won't ye hush !' till finally the slave stood still, and bore the tortures 
with only a groan. 

" As soon as he had completed his task, the Doctor came in, panting, and al- 
most out of breath, and addressing Mr. Boucher, said, ' Won't you go to prayer 
with us, sir ?' The amazed circuit rider fell upon his knees and prayed, utter- 
ing he hardly knew what. When he left the house, the poor creature of a slave 
had crept up and knelt at the door during prayer, with his body gory with blood 
down to his very heels." 

Edward Smith, of Pittsburgh, Pa., a popular Methodist minister, in a recent 
discourse on Slavery, states that the slaveholders in the section of Virginia in 



which he formerly resided did not pretend to justify themselves from the Bible, 
until they were induced to do so by a leading Doctor of Divinity. He says : — 

" The'Doctor made the important discovery that Slavery was not sinful, that 
the relation was sanctioned by the Holy Scriptures. He was at that time a 
professor in one of the schools of the prophets, L e. a Theological Seminary. 
This important discovery, which was a soothing unction to the oppresser's soul, 
was made known in an ecclesiastical association of my native State, Virginia. 

** This Rev. Doctor made another discovery which did him little more credit 
than this- that it was a sin for a slave to pray to the Almighty on the Sabbath 
day, if the master was administering needful chastisement He was a slave- 
holder, and a severe one too, and often, with his own hands, he applied the cow- 
hide to the naked backs of his slaves. On one occasion, a woman that served 
in the house, committed en Sabbath morning, an offense of too great magnitude 
to go unpunished until Monday morning. In towns and cities in the South, 
slaves are whipped, for the most part, in cellars, to prevent their cries from being 
heard so far as they would be under other situations. This is not the case on j 
the plantations. The dwellers in towns are not willing to let the neighborhood I 
in which they live know how often they whip their slaves. The Doctor lived j 
in a town, and on this occasion took his woman in the cellar, and, as is usual j 
in such cases, stripped her from her waist up, and then applied the lash. The j 
woman writhed and winced under each stroke, and cried, ' Oh Lord ! Oh Lord ! \ 
Oh Lord!' The Doctor stopped, and his hands fell to his side as though struck 
with the palsy ; he gazed on the woman with astonishment, and thus addressed 
her, (the congregation must pardon me for repeating his words;) ' Hush, you 
bitch, will you take the name of the Lord in vain on the Sabbath day "?' He 
finished whipping, and then went and essayed to preach that Gospel to his con- 
gregation which proclaims liberty to the captive, and the opening of the prison- ! 
doors to them that are bound. This was ttie man who made the important dis- j 
covery that slavery was not sinful ; and surely he was just the man for such a 

DISUNOIK— By Wendell Phillips. 

"Instinct is a great thing," says Shakspeare: and it is remarkable how 
instinctively every anti-slavery movement, for the last fifty years, has found 
itself arrayed against the Union ; and how instinctively, also, every such move- 
ment has been branded by the South as treasonable. Both tendencies were 
right. The abolitionist finds no readier foe — no greater obstacle than the 
Union : and the lover of the Constitution of 1781) knows that slavery and the 
Constitution will die together. All anti-slavery men have felt this; — most of 
them without being fully conscious of it. But the merit and glory of the 
American Anti-slavery Society have been, that we have plainly seen, and as 
frankly confessed, that our warfare is with the American Union, and that we 
expect success only in its downfall. 

We seek the Dissolution of the Union, because the inhabitants of a country 
must either support or oppose the Government. They cannot be neutral. Their 
silenee is sanction. But .this Government we cannot support, because it 
requires of its citizens things which no honest man can do; and, secondly, be- 
cause its chief result has been to give greater stability, strength and extension 
to the slave system. 

But for the fear of Northern bayonets, pledged for the master's protection, the 
slaves would long since have wiping a peaceful emancipation from the fears of 
their oppressors, or sealed their own redemption in blood. 

But for the countenance of the Northern Church, the Southern conscience 
would have long since awakened to its guilt, and the impious sight of a Church 
made up of slaveholders and ealted the Church of Christ, been scouted from 
the world. 

But for the weight of Northern influence, Louisiana had never been bought, 
and then there never would have been a domestic slave trade ; Texas had 
never been stolen ; nor the Floridas usurped ; nor any means of ease found for 
the serpent, which, girdled with the fire of the world's scorn, was dying by its 
own sting. 

The North supplies the ranks of the army. Witness the muster-rolls of the 



Revolution; witness Randolph's taunt, that all the South meant to do was to' 
furnish officers ; witness South Carolina's excuse in 1779 that her sons dared 
not quit home for the war and leave their slaves behind ; witness the South- j 
western press just now, dissuading from too free volunteering for the Texan 
war for fear that the slaves should seize the opportunity and rise. Yet it was 
national troops, thus drafted, which put down the insurrection of Nat. Turner : \ 
national troops secured the Floridas, thus snatching from the o'er-stung suffer- ; 
ers of Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, their only refuge from our vulture's 
talons : national troops cover Texas, without which, Mr. Secretary Upshur ; 
told the world, the institution of slaveiy would not live there ten years". 

To our shame, the South confesses that, to us she " is indebted for a perma- ! 
nent safeguard against insurrection : that the dissolution of the Union is the I 
dissolution of Slavery : that a million of slaves are ready to rise at the first tap j 
of the drum, and, but for us, where is she to look for protection." We are no I 
advocates for supporting the slave in insurrection, but we loathe still more the I 
supporting of the master in his tyranny. " Hands off," is the Anglo-Saxon j 
motto. Let both parties have fair play ; and then if the master, in his fear of j 
blood, grants the slave his freedom, go home and blush to think how many \ 
years your guilty partnership has encouraged him to refuse this justice. 

We seek the dissolution of the Union, because the temptation of Southern | 
support is too much for Northern virtue, either in church or slate. Hence the I 
ambition of the great sects hastens to strike hands with the slave- trader, and i 
trims its creed to suit the market. While Northern statesmanship is but a com-' 
petition in baseness; — a bidding for the town's poor — a trial of which party will ! 
be content with least for betraying their constituents. 

We curse the Constitution of 1789, because it is a cunning device, an attempt 
to evade the laws of God j a policy of insurance which the North gave her j 
Southern sisters when they started on this mutual slave voyage. For Nature 
compels to freedom by making slavery burn up the soil on which she rests, and 
the slave grows burdensome as free labor presses on his heels. But the Union 
says to Virginia, "Not so; when your virgin soil is exhausted raise men 
instead of tobacco, and we Will protect the domestic market by that highest of 
all tariffs — the penalty of death against the foreign trader. But for this com- 
promise the whole Atlantic border would now be free. 

God and Nature have made the master tremble lest his property in man take 
feet and vanish. The Union gives him her marshals and courts, her judges 
'and laws, her army and navy, to quiet his fears, and bring back the fugitive, if 
found where the National Vulture flaps his wings. 

Of this Constitution it is enough for us to know that, beneath it, the slaves 
have trebled in numbers, and slaveholders have monopolized the offices and! 
dictated the policy of the Government ; prostituting the strength of the nation to 
the support of slavery here and elsewhere ; trampling on the rights of the 
Free States, and making the courts of the country their tools. We have the ' 
highest authority for " judging a tree by its fruits." " The preservation, propa- 1 
gation, and perpetuation of slavery," says Adams, " is the vital and animating; 
spirit of the National Government." Our connection with the Slave States 
has kept the colored race among us under the ban of a cruel and wasting 
prejudice. 

Let no one say, these things need not have been, and we may reasonably 
hope for better times to come. 

Not so. We shall never launch on another era with a more glowing love 
j of liberty and justice than that which pervaded the nation's mind at the close of 
the Revolution. 

We shall never try the experiment of letting freedom, with fettered feet, run 
a race with slavery, furnished with wings, under better auspices than while the 
spirit of Wythe and Jefferson made Virginia tremble for her right to crush and 
kill ; while Jay covered New York with his angel wings, and Samuel Adams 
thundered in Faneuil Hall. AH that political man could do, chained to the I 
compromises of 1789, has been done : and whore is the statesman vain enough 
to ask our confidence in trying over again the experiment, in which Jay and 
King,.Ellsworth and Strong, Martin and Wythe, Adams and Ames have failed 1 



No matter what we may think of the character or of the provisions of the 
Constitution ; there are always, beneath live ■parchment, elements of political 
strength and activity which overrule statutes : and these elements have been 
found such, in a trial of fifty years, that if you run your eye over the list of 
Northern statesmen you will find them all either members of a defeated party 
or traitors ; — men who won success only by submitting to a baptism of treason 
— treason to their lineage, to their own principles, and to their birth-place : who 
have lived only by speaking at Washington what they feared to say at home, 
and by whispering at home what they dared not meet at Washington ; and 
whose political death has dated from the day when they were equally well 
known in both places. Witness Shaw of Lanesboro', Webster of Marshfield, 
Van Buren of Kinderhook, and Everett of Cambridge. 

We abjure the Union, because we will not sail with slavery at the helm ; — 
because our bayonets shall never shield the hearth, wife, or child, of any 
man, in order that be may safely trade in human flesh; — because our hands 
shall never thrust back into hell the trembling fugitive, whom our example and 
the sight of our happiness has tempted to run from it ; — and finally, because we 
believe if the old men of 1770 could now lift up their heads and see the ruin 
they have wrought, they would curse us as bastards if we did not do them the 
justice to believe they would have hated such a result, and if we did not do our 
utmost, in mere justice to them, to blot from history the memory of this, their 
only, but, alas ! their momentous folly or crime. 

SKETCH OF HAYTL— Bv Rev. John- Weiss. 

The island of Hayti is notable for being the seat of the first independent 
Empire founded by African Slaves. Their struggle for freedom developed 
many remarkable men, and was graced with the highest talent and moral force, 
it gave to posterity the character of Toussahd, justly styled "the first of the 
blacks," and vindicated the moral and intellectual capacity of his race. It de- 
molished the barrier of prejudice and caste, by placing, almost at a single leap, 
a down-trodden and divided race, upon a level with the best forms of Caucasian 
humanity: and this too, not in the persons of a few anomalies, but by dozens 
and scores of brave soldiers, sagacious organizers, and even thinkers and writers. 

Previous to the great insurrection of 1702, the slaves lived, with rare excep- 
tions, in extreme debasement. No public opinion had checked and modified 
the natural arrogance of Creole masters, and cases of extreme cruelty were 
unavenged by any law. But other causes beside the desire to escape from an 
oppressive system, threw the slaves into revolt. It was the period of the French 
Revolution, and the island responded to every throb and motion of the mother- 
countiy. But the whites turned republicans only on their own account, and 
never dreamed of affixing the national colors to" the hat of the mulatto, who 
represented a numerous and respectable class. At this time they numbered 
40,000, exactly equal to the whites. The slaves were rated at half a million. 
This lively struggle between the whites and mulattoes, the abortive movements 
of the latter, and their cruel fate, stirred the slaves in the northern part of the 
island ; and their excitement was adroitly fomented by mulatto emissaries, till a 
bloody and cruel revolt ensued. The horrors of a single night proved to their 
astonished masters that the re-action always equals the depression. A century of 
slavery had so brutalized their spirits that they knew not the nature of liberty. 

But in the course of the season Toussaint joined the insurgent slaves, organ- 
ized them, repressed their excesses, and united them to the Spanish government 
in the eastern part of the island to act under royalism against republicanism, j 
The French were doubly odious \ they called themselves their masters, and they ! 
had guillotined their king. Toussaint seems both to have desired the freedom j 
of his race, and to have loved royalism. 

For fifty years he had lived in quiet obscurity and from a plantation, rising i 

Ifrom one grade to another, till he reached the post of coachman. His educa- ' 
tion was meagre, his heart was upright and tender, his probity severe, his under- j 
standing clear, sound and sinewy. He was taciturn, meditative, cool and 
impenetrable. He soon attached "the blacks to his person by the irresistible; 
magnetism of bus character, and their enthusiastic devotion was only equalled j 



by that of the French for Napoleon. The Spaniards loaded him with honors and 
caresses ; but it soon appeared that he loved freedom better than his old idea of 
Royalism, and when the French decreed the emancipation of the slaves in 1793, 
he passed over with all his forces to their side. By a series of rapid manoeuvres, 
he relieved places besieged by the royalist Spanish and English ; and the French 
Republican Commissioner in receiving the keys, exclaimed, " this man effects 
an opening (puverture) wherever he goes." The word was caught by the mo- 
bile and enthusiastic multitude, and he was baptised by the voice of a nation. 
"I accept the name," said he, "because I will open the gates of abetter future." 

His government was wise and timely ; no Frenchman understood his race. 
He rid himself of Generals and Commissioners, by astute manoeuvres, and ruled 
independently for the blacks, but always under the name of the French Repub- 
lic. The island was restored to nearly its ancient prosperity. The necessity of 
the times, and the splendor of his example, lifted many men directly out of bar- 
barism, strengthened them with culture, and developed the varied talents suita- 
ble for government, diplomacy and war. Christophe, one of his successors, 
and the introducer of the school-system of Lancaster in the island, was a notable 
example. Bravery and military skill were dog cheap everywhere ; but some of his 
generals also administered wisely the affairs ol provinces ; as for instance, 
Paul L'overture, Charles Belair. Toussaint's officials were well chosen, and 
never disgraced their post. Genuine men were found to order ; judges, minis- 
ters, secretaries and embassadors. Only one important case of mal-administration 
occurred during Toussaint's government, in the person of his nephew, General 
Moyse, who was shot by court-martial for the offence. So meagre a notice as 
this", necessarily prevents all interesting anecdote and detail. Suffice it to say, 
Toussaint was an organizer and not a mere imitator. He originated special 
schemes adapted to the peculiarity of the case ; as in the treatment of the culti- 
vators, who were the former slaves, and to whom he made industry attractive. 
The great experiment failed only through the ambition of Napoleon, the jeal- 
ousy of Toussaint's mulatto and French enemies, and the desertion of his best 
generals, deceived by French gold and promises. The catastrophe is soon re- 
lated. Eleven thousand men, the power of the French army, under Le Clerc, 
the brother-in-law of the first consul, forced him to capitulate, after much hard 
fighting at fearful odds. On some miserable pretext he was seized and trans- 
ported to France. This noble child of the tropics died of consumption in a 
damp dungeon of the fortress of Besancjon — 1803 (1). 

If we content ourselves now with asking, what was the result of his life and 
rule, the important and satisfactory reply stands ready. The capacity of his 
race for self-government has been fairly tetsed and established ; the manifold 
riches of the African nature have, for once, been lavishly displayed ; the power 
of reflection and organization has been settled to belong to them beyond dispute. 
The horrors attendant upan the first revolt, before the masterly capacity of 
Toussaint directed the tempest, show the dreadful consequence of an institution 
so " peculiar" as to destroy the better instincts of the soul, and to substitute 
license for freedom. The gradual organization of an African empire adorned 
with culture — and founded too, be it remembered, upon peace rather than re- 
taliation — as the counterpart of slavery and barbarism, make us sure that the 
oppressed only require a heaven-directed impulse, the maimed and stifled nature 
only a providential moment, the mocked and branded negro only a single 
chance from his more fortunate brother, and the world will witness the rise and 
cultivation of another race, according to the infallible witness of history and 
the laws of the past. The cause of the present imbecility and decline, too 
evident upon the island, cannot be briefly stated. One of its elements consists 
in the hereditary feud between the two classes, the mulatto and the black, That 
has been the fruitful source of its principal disasters; it was the chief thing 
which threatened the tranquility of Toussaint's reign. The government has 
alternated between the two ; the mulatto sway has been noted for its apathy, 
weakness and display ; that of the negro for its fiery concentration, its impa- 
tience of obstacles, its often ill-directed efforts. So long as it is only a dubious 
struggle for mastery, we cannot hope to see the island achieve its proper destiny, 
It is again expectant of " the Hour and the Man." 



"WHY CAN'T YOU ABOLITIONISTS LETT THE LIBERTY PARTY 
ALONE ?"— By Edmund Quincy. 

" Because we know that it was in its origin and design hostile to the 
anti-slavery movement. That it was created by the men who had 
deserted our ranks and robbed us of our flag and military chest— our 
Emancipator and our depository — for the pursose of conciliating a 
pro-slavery church and clergy, and of covering their own retreat back 
to the church and the world. Though we are sometimes (falsely, as 
a society) called non-resistants, our principles do not impel, us to sub- 
mit to have our throats cut without at least telling the assassins and 
the world what they are about." 

" But you do not condemn the whole party for the crime of a few 
of their number?" 

" Yes, when those few are the leaders and the organs of the party. 
We treat the third party as we do the other two. There are good 
men and sincere (though mistaken) abolitionists among the whigs and 
democrats as well as among the Birneycrats ; but as long as they choose 
to have Henry Clay and James K. Polk, and the Intelligencer and the 
Union for the exponents of their principles before the world, they 
must not complain of being put all in our condemnation. ' Noscitur a 
sociis.' A man is known by the company he keeps. Their remedy 
is to come out. You remember the fate of the stork who was caught 
among the cranes." 

" But you surely make a distinction between the whigs and demo- 
crats, and the liberty party. You must allow that it has for its object 
| the abolition of slavery — which neither of the other parties have." 

" 1 will allow no such thing. The whigs and democrats make good 
professions enough, and if they would carry out their principles hon- 
estly, there would be no slavery in a very short time. The difficulty 
with them and with the third party is that they don't mean what they 
say." 

" What! Do you mean to say that the liberty party is not an anti- 
slavery party ?" 

" To be sure I do. When I find a man or a party blocking up the 
way of the anti-slavery movement, and doing what they can to de- 
stroy it and the character of its friends, I feel very sure that that man 
or that party, whatever else they may be, are not anti-slavery. We 
judge of men's anti-slavery character by what they do, and not by 
what they say. You remember George Bradburn used to tell us, be- 
fore he ratted, that calling the calf's tail a leg, did not make it one." 

" But you must admit this assertion. The liberty party never nom- 
inate slaveholders for office. And, then, should they even prevail, 
j you cannot doubt that their first measure would be to abolish slavery ; 
| at least, as far as they could constitutionally." 

" Aye, there's the rub, my friend. Suppose Mr. Birney elected 
president to-morrow, what would be the first thing he would have 
to do ? Swear to support the Constitution, would he not ? And what 
does that require of him i To suppress servile insurrection and re- 
store fugitive slaves, does it not ? Pretty work for an abolitionist !" 

" But Beriah Green, and William Goodell, and Gerrit Smith think 
that the Constitution is an anti-slavery instrument. And other wise 
men think that a man is not bound to do a thing he considers wrong, 
though he has sworn it." 

" I grant you, he is not bound to do the wicked thing even though 



he has sworn it ; but can he innocently swear to do it, not meaning to per- 
form it! That's the point. As to the Constitution being an anti-sla- 
very instrument, Messrs. Green, Goodell, and Smith may be very wise 
men, but they do not happen to be the constitutional authority on the 
subject. The Supreme Court has settled that question, guided by the 
obvious meaning of the pro-slavery clauses, and by the well known 
intentions of the framers. If every man may construe the Constitu- 
tion, as he understands it, and obey just as much of it as he likes, 
we should soon have no government with a vengeance !" 

" But do you mean to say, that a man ought to return fugitive 
slaves and put down a servile insurrection, if he have sworn to sup- 
port the Constitution ?" 

" I mean to say that he has no right to swear to support the Con- 
stitution unless he means to do the things it commands him to do. A 
man in this dilemma has to choose between obeying God and man, 
between perjury and crime. We say he cannot choose either and be 
innocent." 

"But I cannot help thinking, after all, that the liberty party, with 
so many good men in it, must be an anti-slavery party." 

" I cannot think that an anti-slavery party, the object of which is to 
elect men to put down a revolution of the slaves, to vindicate their 
rights, and to restore the fugitive that has escaped to his tyrant again." 

" But how can you account for the existence of the party, except 
from a wish to abolish slavery ?" 

" I will tell you how it is made up. First, of men who wish to 
divert the attention of the inquiring from the Church to the far less 
faulty State : who hold that no man is fit for any political office who 
is not an abolitionist, but is content to sit under the preaching of a 
minister who is notoriously pro-slavery : who think a man worthy 
to be the ambassador of Christ, and the vicegerent of God on earth, 
a good shepherd to keep the lambs of Christ's fold, who is not fit to 
impound the stray hogs of his own parish ! Secondly, of disappoint- 
ed Whigs and Democrats, who have a grudge at their old parties, for 
some slight to themselves or their friends ; old battered politicians 
who have been kicked out of their old connections as invaluables, 
who are ready to take their chance with any new party that comes 
up, so it annoys and bothers their old one. This constitutes the 
largest division of the party, by far. Thirdly, of true-hearted aboli- 
tionists, who do sincerely and honestly believe that this is the best 
way to abolish slavery : who acknowledge the evil nature and bad 
actions of their associates; but think that this is the nature of 
political parties ; and that these are necessary tools for a good end ! 
not seeing, good easy men, that it is they that are made the tools of 
their unprincipled associates for their bad ends ! These are the two 
grains of wheat in the bushel of chaff." 

" Well ! after all ; I can't but think that I shall see the liberty party 
do a great work for the abolition of slavery, yet." 

" You must make haste, then, my friends ; for, if we really believe 
their own accounts of themselves, the party is on its last legs. Like 
other humbugs it has had its day, but its day is over. It acknow- 
ledges to have had like Humpty Dumpty in Mother Goose, " a great 
fall!" 

" And all the king's horses, and all the king's men, 
Can't set Humpty Dumpty up again !" 



THE NO-VOTING THEORY. 

. BY WENDELL. rHILLIPS. 

"God neper made a citizen, and no one will escape as a man, from the sins 
which kc commits as a citizen" 

Can an abolitionist consistently take office, or vote, under the Constitution of 
the United States 1 

1st, What is an abolitionist 1 

One who thinks slaveholding a sin in all circumstances, and desires its 
abolition. -•' 

2d, What do taking office and voting under the Constitution imply % 
The President swears " to execute the office of president," and " to preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." The judges <: to dis- 
charge the duties incumbent upon them agreeably to the Constitution and laws 
of the United States." 

All executive, legislative, and judicial officers, both of the several "States and 
of the General Government, before entering on the performance of their official 
duties, are bound to take an oath or affirmation, " to support tke Constitution of 
the United States." This is what every office-holder expressly promises in so 
many words. It is a contract between him and the whole nation. The voter, 
who, by voting, sends his fellow-citizen into office as his representative, knowing 
beforehand that the taking of this oath is the first duty his agent will have to 
perform, does, by his vote, request and authorise him to take it. He therefore, 
by voting, impliedly engages to support the Constitution. What one does by 
his agent he does himself. Of course no honest man will authorise and re- 
quest another to do an act which he thinks it wrong to do himself. Every vo- 
ter, therefore, is bound to see, before voting, whether he could himself honestly 
swear to support the Constitution, It is universally considered throughout the 
country, by common men and by the courts, as a promise to do what the Con- 
stitution bids, and to avoid what it forbids. It was in the spirit of this oath, 
under which he spake, that Daniel Webster said in New York, " The Consti- 
tution gave it (slavery) solemn guaranties. To the full extent of these guar- 
anties we are all bound by the Constitution. All the stipulations contained in 
the Constitution m favor of the slaveholding States ought to be fulfilled; and so 
far as depends on me, shall be fulfilled, in the fulness of their spirit and to the 
exactness of their letter." 

It is more than the oath of allegiance ; more than a mere promise that we 
will not resist the laws. For it is an engagement to " support them;" as an 
officer of government, to carry them into effect. Without such a promise on 
the part of its functionaries, how could government exist 1 It is more than the 
expression of that obligation which rests on all peaceable citizens to submit to 
laws, even though they will not actively support them. For it is the promise 
which the judge makes, that he will actually do the business of the courts; 
which the sheriff assumes, that he will actually execute the laws. 

Let it be remarked, that it is an oath to support tke Constitution — that is, the 
lohole of it ; there are no exceptions. And let it be remembered, that by it, each 
one makes a contract with the whole nation, that he will do certain acts. 
3d. What is the Constitution which each voter thus engages to support 1 
It contains the" following clauses: 

Art. 1, Seet. 2. " Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned 
among the several States, which may be included within this Union, according 
to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole 
number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, 
and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons." 
Art. 1, Sec . 8, " Gongress shall have power*** to suppress insurrections." 
Art. 4. Sect 2. " No person, held to service or labor in one State, under the 
laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regu- 
lation therein, be discharged from such serviee or labor ; but shall be delivered 
up on elaini of the party to whom such service or labor may be due." 

Art. 4. Sect. 4. " The United States shall guarantee to every State in this 
Union a republican form of government ; and shall protect each of them against 



invasion; and, on application of the legislature, or of the executive, (when the 
legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence." 

The first of these clauses, relating to representation, gives to 10,000 inhabi- 
tants of Carolina equal weight in the government with 40,000 inhabitants of 
Massachusetts, provided they are rich enough to hold 50,000 slaves : — and ac- 
cordingly confers on a slaveholding community additional political power for 
every slave held among them, thus' tempting them to continue to uphold the 
system : 

Its results have been, in the language of John duincy Adams, " to make the 
preservation, propagation, and perpetuation of slavery the vital and animating 
spirit of the National Government ;" and again, to enable " a knot of slavehold- 
ers to give the law and prescribe the policy of the country." So that " since 
1830 slavery, slaveholding, slavebreeding, and slavetrading have formed the 
whole foundation of the policy of the Federal Governmant.*' The second and 
the last articles, relating to insurrection and domestic violence, perfectly inno- 
cent themselves — yet being made with the fact directly in view that slavery ex- 
ists among us, do deliberately pledge the whole national force against the un- 
happy slave if he imitate our fathers and resist oppression — thus making us 
partners in the guilt of sustaining slavery : the third is a promise, on the part 
of the whole North, to return fugitive slaves to their masters ; a deed which 
God's law expressly condemns, and which every noble feeling of our nature re- 
pudiates with loathing and contempt. 

These are the clauses which the abolitionist, by voting or taking office, en- 
gages to uphold. While he considers slaveholding to be sin, he still rewards 
the master with additional political power for every additional slave that he can 
purchase. Thinking slaveholding to be sin, he pledges to the master the aid of 
whole army and navy of the nation to reduce his slave again to chains, should 
he at any time succeed a moment in throwing them off. Thinking slaveholding 
to be sin, he goes on, year after year, appointing by his rote judges and marshals 
to aid in hunting up the fugitives, and seeing that they are delivered back to 
those who claim them ! How beautifully consistent are his principles and his 

promises'. 

ABOLITION OF SLAVERY. 

Is it practicable 1 Is it safe 1 Will not the slaves turn upon their masters, 
and cut their throats the moment they are emancipated 1 History will tell us. , 

Slavery was abolished in Vermont by its Constitution in 1793. In Massa- . 
chusetts, it was pronounced illegal by the Courts under the Constitution adopted j 
in 1780. Rhode Island and Connecticut abolished it in 1784; New York in 
1799 ; New Jersey in 1804 ; Pennsylvania in 1780. The latter State was the 
first to pass a special act against it. . j 

Mexico, on the Anniversary of its Independence in 1829, issued a decree by j 
which it declared all its slaves free, " as an act of national justice and bene- ' 
ficence !" 

Buenos Ayres was the first South American Republic that abolished Slaver}* i 
in 1816 ; Columbia and Chili followed her example in 1821 ; Bolivia in 1826 ; 
Peru, Guatemala and Montevideo in 1828; and Uraguay in 1843. 

Great Britain abolished slavery completely in all the Colonies in the West | 
Indies, South America, Southern Africa, and the Indian Ocean, in 1838. In 
1843 it was abolished in British India, and at Malacca, Singapore, Penang, 
Province Wellesley, and Scin.de, and also at the British settlement on the Gold ; 
Coast in Western Africa ; and in 1844 at Hong Kong, and in the Island of ! 
Ceylon. 

Not one single drop of blood has ever been shed in consequence of the ! 
abolition of slavery in those various parts of the world within a half century. ' 

Even the Turks have set us an example. The Bay of Tunis commenced j 
the abolition of slavery within his dominions in 1843, and in the early part of I 
1846 it was totally extinguished. 

But the United States has re-establisJied slavery in the conquered provinces of ! 
another republic. Under the protecting influence of the Constitution of the : 
United States, the accursed s)*stem has been fostered into a giant growth, from i 
the Ohio to the Rio Grande ! I 



" WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH IT V 

" But, after all, friend Hopewell, what have we to do with it V said my 
I neighbor Lookhom one day, after casting his eye over an Anti-slavery news- 
| paper which I had just lent him. " I know there are a good many slaves down 
j South there, and it's a dreadful bad thing. But I don't see as I can help it ; or 
I that it's my business to meddle with 'em, if I can." 

My neighbor Lookhom is one of your slow, cautious people. He is a very 
! good man in his way, but only a little too apt to remember the maxim, " that 
[ charity should begin at home," or forget that it shouldn't stay there. There are 
i a good many such in our neighborhood. 

" Well, now, Mr. Lookhom," said I, " you are a man of good common sense, 

and I am rather surprised at such a question from you. But let us suppose a 

' case. In this village there are about 3000 inhabitants. Now, suppose that out of 

j these 3000 there were 500 ignorant, shiftless people, who were without any means 

I of their own — had never received any religious or moral instruction — had never 

, had a day's schooling in their lives — did veiy little work, consequently, produced 

I little — were a good deal inclined to pilfer — had as lief lie as tell the truth — 

j weren't very particular about the marriage relation — and, in short, were about 

j as poor, miserable a set of creatures, as could be got together ; — don't you think 

that their condition would be some of our business 1 Even if we cared nothing 

about the great principle of Christianity, Love thy neighbor, wouldn't it be well 

for us to look after these people for the sake of our wood-piles, and hen-roosts 

and hay-stacks, as well as our taxes 1 Wouldn't it be our duty to inquire into 

their actual condition, and see whether this, which common report says about 

} them, is true, and whether there is'nt some cause for the existence of all these bad 

i qualities, for which they are not half so responsible as we are, who consider 

j ourselves wiser and better than they 1" 

" Why, to be sure, I do, if there wasanvthing in their condition differing par- 
ticularly from the common run of poor folks. But, how will you make out that 
| that is just the case with slavery V 

" Just this way. Extend the boundaries of your village, and include this na- 
tion of ours, with its 18,000,000 of people, and you have in it the same proportion, 
i that is, one-sixth of these poor people. Now, if, in the first case, it is your duty to 
know and do something about their condition, it is in the last case, whether you 
do it because you are a good Christian, or because you are a respectable man, 
I who does not like to pay too heavy tax-bills, and does like to see his corn-barns 
I and wood-houses well filled." 

" But these slaves are a great way off, neighbor ; and if they are such a 

; miserable, shiftless set as you make 'em out to be, I guess the less we have to do 

| with 'em the better. They don't steal my corn, and my tax-bill is none the hea- 

j vier for them, that I know'of. They aren't our town's poor any how. Let them 

take care of 'em that's got 'em, I say." 

" Don't be in a hurry. I hav'n't done with the village yet. Now, suppose 

I when you come to inquire about these people close about home here, who do 

rob you of your property, and for whom you do have to pay taxes, you should 

j find out that they are under the thumb of about fifty men, and have been ever 

since they were born. That these masters of theirs, by an agreement among 

themselves, have deprived the poor people of the power of becoming anything 

else than what they are, — have "denied them all intellectual and moral training, 

j 10b them of all the fruits of their labor, give them just enough to keep soul and 

body together, to-day, that they may work to-morrow for their benefit. You 

wouldn't much wonder at their condition then 1 And if you found out that it 

I was only their masters that they stole from, who stole everything from them, I 

: you wouldn't much blame them, would you 1 And you would think it your j 

I duty to do something to abolish such monstrous cruelty and injustice, should j 

j you not V 

" You're about right there, neighbor." 

" And when you come to look a little further, if you find that the system, 
I which these fifty men have adopted, is one of great waste and extravagance, — 
j that their lands are all worn out, and mortgaged — that every few years they 



fail, and their honest debts to you and your neighbors for your corn, and wood, 
and hay, are never paid — and that they can't help doing - these things just so, 
long as they hold on to their system, simply because they have a set of people 
about them who don't care what becomes of the farms, for they've no interest in 
them, and won't work if they can help it, and so everything goes to rack and 
ruin ; — and if, too, you find that the same fifty are the very men who have always 
had everything their own way in town-meetings — have always been the select- 
men, the overseers of the poor, the assessors, the tax-gatherers, the constables, the 
town-clerks, and everything else ; — that they have governed the town just as 
they please — made you pay all the taxes, mend all the roads, take care of the 
poor, while they did nothing but pocket the salaries ; — that they have sometimes 
granted you licenses to fish in the rivers, and when you had put all your capi- 
tal in boats and fish stakes, and everything necessary to carry on the business, 
and are cleverly at work, have taken away the licenses, and your boats have 
rotted on the beach, and one-half your capital is sunk ; — have offered you a 
bounty on salt, and as soon as you are in a fair way of making money at that 
business, have withdrawn it, and your salt-vats are left to catch rain in ; — have 
encouraged you to improve the water-powers on the streams, and put up mills, 
but as soon as you are getting some return from this new outlay of capital, have 
made your water-privileges useless by bringing in cheaper foreign goods; — and 
then when you have gone back to farming, and got your farms well under way, 
and are making money at it, they put a tax on everything that comes from 
abroad, so that your produce will buy you almost nothing, and you must go to 
work and manufacture again for yourselves, till the same swindling game is 
played over again, and you are left to whistle once more for your squandered 

| capital with your hands in your empty pockets ; — and if you find out that this 
state of things is a necessary consequence of ihe existence of that system whereby they 
hold one-sixth of the people of the town wretchedly popr and ignorant, and 
which forces them to resort to every expedient to sell what little they do produce 
as dear as possible, and to buy what they want as cheap as possible — and that 
your system of labor and their system of labor is continually and necessarily 
clashing, and that your interests and their interests never can come together, and 
that they never want they should, because by continuing this state of things 
they can always keep you quarrelling among yourselves, and maintain their 
own ascendency, and live in ease and idleness with their 500 to work for them : 
— I say, neighbor, when, by looking a little into matters, you find out that all this is 
true, and that the fifty are not the masters of the 500 only but of the whole town- 
ship, wouldn't you begin to think that you had something to do with it 1" 

" Do you mean to say, Friend Hopeful, that slavery does all this at the North 1 
For I see that is what you are driving at." 

" All this ! I ' havn't begun' yet. Look a little further at the doings of your 
neighbors. After having ruined you three or four times over, they find out that 
their farms aren't big enough to support them and their vassals, with all your help, 
though everything that is done by the town government is done for their benefit. 
They've run out the land till it isn't worth a dollar an acre, though they had the 
best part of the settlement to begin with. Moreover, the 500 are getting restless, 

I for their masters can't give them enough to eat, and support their own style of 

' living at the same time, and the poor creatures have got a notion that they will do 
better if they are let alone. You remember, that some time ago, they laid a tax 
on you to buy a large tract of land off at the westward, and made it a part of the 
town, and some of their sons moved on to it, and took some of the poor people 
with them. This gave them a larger vote than ever in town-meetings, but as 

| there Wasn't poor enough in the new settlement, the old folks, you find, were in 
the habit of selling the children of their poor to go out there, and finding that 
this was more profitable for both parties, they have concluded in the old settle- 
ment to keep their poor for breeding, and send the offspring to the new — where 
they work them up in about seven years — as the demand wasn't equal to the 
supply if they trusted to their own increase. After awhile, this begins also to be 
overstocked, for the breeding settlement produces more than are wanted. And 
as your sons are growing up, too, there is some fear of their being out-voted in 



* - — — — "-^^ 

town-meetings, so they must have more land yet. Adjoining your town on the 
south, is another that has lately been set off. The people there have had their 
troubles, but have well nigh got over them, and especially have got rid of just 
such a system as curses you, and are beginning to look up in the world. They | 
have a rich tract as large as half a dozen of your largest farms, on which your ; 
fifty-man-power have cast a longing eye. They don't know how to get hold j 
of it at first, and so they must get your consent in town-meetings to buy it, and I 
it is of no use to you people in the north part of the town, who have now more j 
land than you know what to do with. However, they send oflfa few blustering I 
rowdy fellows to settle there, who give the place such a character that every- j 
body calls it the " Valley of Rascals." They soon get up a quarrel with the | 
real owners, and after awhile declare that they have set off the tract as a town by j 
itself, and then ask you to annex it to yours. Now will you countenance such 
bare-faced robbery as this in your town-meeting, especially when you know that 
all these fellows want is to give a longer lease to their poor-folks system, and 
have everything their own way in the management of the townl" 

"But stop, neighbor. Suppose they tell you that all they want to annex this 
new town for, is to give it the advantages of our government. You know 
we're the most flourishing settlement about here." 

* I'm not so certain about our being so very flourishing. Pride goes before a 
fall, they say. But never mind about that now. You know this at any rate ; 
that their poor- folks system would starve itself to death before long, if they didn't 
get some new land to live on. And if you won't take my word for it, you'll 
take their's, and some of their smartest men say so, and give that as the very 
reason why they must have more land, tho' they didn't mean that your northern 
farmers should ever know that they said so. And then when at last it is voted 
in town-meeting to take the settlement, and they insist that they shall have the 
right of carrying the poor folks there, and buying as many as they want to 
stock it from your fifty men, and that they shall have the same right that the 
fifty men have, of a vote in the town-meeting for every certain number of these 
poor, I think it will he pretty plain to your mind, that they have two, and onlytwo, 
objects in this robbery ; first to give the poor-man system a chance to live the 
longer ; and next to carry everything before them in town-meeting as they 
always have done, by the help of the votes they get. Isn't it so V 

" I don't see but what it is. But then suppose it's all settled, how are you 
agoing to help it V 

" Ah ! But how comes it to be settled 1 that's the question. You folks up 
north there knew all about this plan before, and swear some of you, that you 
never will submit to it. But when it comes to the point, your neighbor John 
Abbott, that keeps shop round the corner, says, ' well, never mind. 'Tisn't worth 
while to make a fuss now. I guess if we get this territory I can sell some goods 
to those people, and anyhow the fifty-men-power will let my water-privilege i 
alone if we let 'em have their own way.' And most of you join with him, and ! 
so cover up the wickedness of the thing. The fact is you're afraid. Afraid not 
of doing wrong, but of losing money. You don't so much mind robbing your 
neighbors, to say nothing of the honor of the old village, if your butter and home- 
stuffs will bring a cent more a pound, and two cents more a yard by it. But see 
how it turns out. You give another inch to those fellows — you've given a good 
many — and they take another ell. There is a strip of meadow-land further south 
yet, that they want for the same purpose that they did the whole tract. That 
still belongs to your neighbors, and nobody ever pretended before that it didn't. 
Some of these blusterers go on to that, and strut up and down before the people's 
houses, and trample over their corn, and tear down their fences, and when the 
owners come out and ask them what they mean by such conduct, they knock 
them over the head, and declare that they begun the quarrel ! Blood is shed, 
and you've got an expensive lawsuit on your hands 1 And whose fault is it 1 
isn't it yours 1 You might have stopped this business in the beginning. But ] 
you were afraid to, or too bad to, or a little of both. Now you must send your j 
sons to join in this fight ; and you have got to pay all the costs, for the fifty-man- 1 
power are careful enough to keep their necks out of all such difficulties that they J 
get you into, and to make you bear the expense. And all for what 1 Why, j 



that the poor folks should be poorer still, and more of them, and that you should j 
have less power than ever, in town-meeting. And as for the mill-priviliges of 
John Abbott, and the rest of them, your masters have no sooner got you fairly 
under their thumbs than they take them again. It's good enough for them. | 
And if it wasn't for the wickedness of the thing, and those wretched poor folks, \ 
one could almost be glad that they serve you as they do. By and by, may be, 
you'll find out what they're at, and behave yourselves like men. I "sometimes 
almost wonder that the old settlers don't start up out of their graves, when such 
things are going on over their heads. Your old grandfathers little thought 
that their children would ever be engaged in such work as this." 

" Bad enough ! bad enough ! neighbor, I grant you. 1 don't see but we must 
make this whole matter some of our business, and see if we can't bring the old 
town back where she ought to be." 

" No more, then, about the village and its poor folks and their fifty masters, 
but look for a moment at things that really do exist, and I have done. All that 
I have said, and a great deal more that I might say if I had time now, is true of 
the system of slavery and the slave-power. You know well enough what a 
slave is. A more wretched being doesn't live on the face of the earth. They 
sometimes talk about the poor of Great Britain and the poor of the North in 
comparison. But I tell you, neighbor, there is not a man here, or in Great Bri- 
tain either, — however poor he may be, however bowed down by wretchedness, 
or however degraded by the wrong and crime of others or himself, — that would 
not spurn with indignation and contempt, the insulting offer to change condi- 
tions with the ' fattest and the sleekest' slave. What manhood might be left 
in him would straighten his bent form, and kindle the fire of his dull eye, as 
the spirit of a Freeman aroused itself in him. Slavery ! What a word is 
that ! What a tale doe* it tell of sorrow and of wrong. From the cradle to the 
grave a life of woe. The mother may well weep as her infant draws its first 
breath of life ; and the children rejoice as they huddle the worn-out body of a 
parent into its last resting-place. For one, it is the end of wretchedness that 
found no pity ; for the other, the beginning of sorrow that shall have no hope. 
Ah ! neighbor, if when we sent our Bibles and our Prayer-Books to t-he 
Heathen, we remembered the Heathen at our own door, — if Ave were not for- 
getful of those two great practical precepts which Jesus taught and lived: 
' Love ye one another,' ' Let the strong bear the burdens of the weak ;' — if we 
remembered ' those in bonds as bound with them ' we should never ask, ' what 
have we to do with it V Could we in our happy freedom, and our daily plenty, 
see the slave bending over his hopeless toil, the fruits of which are never his — 
share with him a little while his wretched hut and scanty fare — see the wife 
torn from his bosom, or the child from its mother's arms — know the darkness 
that clouds his mind, and the despair which fills his heart — we should learn 
that we have a duty to perform to these, the poorest of God's poor. If you 
should meet, as I have, one of these poor wretches by the wayside, here in this 
northern State, and know that alone and unaided he had travelled many 
hundred miles on foot, hiding himself for many days in the dark recesses of 
the forests, and pursuing only by night his toilsome journey; and when you 
begged him to stay long enough to receive your aid, begged him at least to take 
from you the names of those who farther on would give him help ; and as 
he turned away, giving a deaf ear to all your entreaties, and shrank from 
you as from a foe, because he saw an enemy in every white man, and with only 
the sun by day, and the north star his guide by night, he hastened on, trem- 
bling and alone, as before, to reach the dominions of a Queen, you would learn, 
as I have, to curse the Republic that has not in it a foot of ground where a 
man can stand and call himself a freeman. Ignorant as he was, he knew that 
these were the United States, and that a common Constitution covered them all, 
and that that Constitution held him a slave. He knew well enough— for that 
his master was sure to teach him — that if he and his fellows should attempt to 
assert the rights which God gave them when he made them men, that you at 
the North would shoulder your glistening muskets, and stand ready at the call 
of one portion of your southern brethren, to assist them to oppress the rest. 
And he knew, too, that should he fly from the ' house of bondage,' and elude 



the keen scent of the bloodhound, and escape the bullet of the hunter, and reach, 
at last, bleeding and worn with toil and privation, your populous North with its 
swarming villages, that even then he was not beyond the reach of the pursuer, 
that you were all banded together to return him whence he came. You can't 
deny this." 

"It's too true'?" 

" Does it matter, then, whether there be 500 of these poor creatures at the other 
end of your village, or 3,000,000 at the other end of your country 1 Is not your 
guilt the same in either case, if you do nothing for them 1 And have you not, 
as a man, and a Christian, the "same duty to the 3,000,000 that you have to 
the 5001" 

" I declare I believe you are more than half right V 1 

*' Go home, then, and think the matter over; and when you see it in its right 
light, as take my word for it you will, talk then to your wife and children ; 
talk to your neighbors, and show them their sin and their duty in this 
thing. Tell them that Bank or Sub-Treasury, Tariff or no Tariff, Land or 
no Land, are not the questions now for this people to settle. That above all 
and before all, the great question of Human Rights or Human Wrong is the 
one that now and here they are called upon to decide. It is a struggle between 
Slavery and Freedom, between Right and "Wrong; and if you don't abolish 
Southern Slavery, and that ere long, then Southern Slavery will abolish, as it 
has well nigh already, Northern Freedom. You have taken sides, thus far, 
with the master, and see what has come of it ! The slave-power has extended 
the Union for its own purposes from the Ohio to the Rio Grande. The Govern- 
ment is, and has been for half a century, a slaveholding Government. The 
only interests it cares for or protects, are the interests of slavery. By the help 
of your own strength your masters have bound you their willing vassals, and 
when all is done they laugh at you for your folly, and mock your imbecility. 
And it all comes of your accursed Union. Either they must conquer you, or 
you them. We have tried it long enough to know which has the better. Take 
sides now with the slaves for their own sakes, for yours, and for the sake of 
the masters. Slavery cannot exist except upon your strength. Deprive it of 
its support, and it will fall of its own weight ; and a blessed day will that be for 
master and slave !" 

"No Union with Slaveholders! That's the word, is it?" 

" Aye ! neighbor, that's the word. And until you believe in and live up to it, 
there is no hope for you. Till you do that, you are both a slaveholder and a 
slave !" 



FREEDOM. 

The noble horse, 
That, in his fiery youth, from his wide nostrils. 
Neigh'd courage to his rider, and brake through 
Groves of opposed pikes, bearing his lord 
Safe to triumphant victory ; old or wounded, 
Was set at liberty, and freed from service. 
The Athenian mules, that from the quarry drew 
Marble, hew'd for the temples of the Gods, 
The great work ended, were dismiss'd, and fed 
At the public cost ; nay, faithful dogs have found 
Their sepulchres ; but man, to man more cruel, 
Appoints no end to the sufferings of his slave.

" Northeners know nothing at all about slavery ; they think it is perpetual 
bondage only ; but of the depth of degradation that word involves, they have no 
conception ; if they had, they would never cease their efforts until so horrible 
a system was overthrown." — A woman of N. Carolina. 



A MILITIA CAPTAIN "IN A FIX." 

Everybody knows, or ought to know, that the citizens of this goodly city are 
not so immersed in the cares of money-making, that they deny themselves that 
privilege which is esteemed so valuable in other sections of the Republic They 
find time to be patriotic even in New-York. That glorious proof of the so- 
vereignty of the people, the " Fall training," is not yet obsolete among us. In 
all our public squares during the last week in September, our citizen-soldiery, 
j armed with muskets or broom-sticks, as best suits their individual tastes, learn 
• the art of war, under the command of a brave captain in motley, to the admi- 
j ration of a crowd of ragged newsboys and other irreverent spectators. 

Our friend Thomas Van Rensselaer, a colored man, received a notice to at- 
j tend one of these glorious gatherings. Of course it was a mistake, as the citi- 
zens of his color are excused by the philanthropy of our laws from doing any 
j of this sort of service. In cases of actual necessity the State will permit them 
I to enjoy the privilege of being shot, but can in nowise put them to the inconve- 
| nience of any previous preparation. But Thomas Van Rensselaer, ever ready 
j to obey the call of his country, borrowed bayonet and belt, musket and cartridge- 
j box, and armed and equipped, as the law directs, appeared at the appointed hour 
! on the Battery. 

In bearing and equipment he was as tall and as good looking a grenadier as 
one would wish to see, and he took his position accordingly in the front rank 
with his fellow-soldiers. There was a movement in the ranks, and the crowd 
around them — that just perceptible rustle, rather felt than seen, which denotes 
in an assembly that something unusual and interesting had happened — when 
he made his appearance. It was doubtless an involuntary acknowledgment of 
the honor which one exempt from the toils and the glories alike of military life, 
had done them by thus promptly signifying his willingness to share in their 
perils. But the captain, unmindful of the humanity of our just laws, and un- 
willing to impose upon the new recruit the duty of serving his country when 
there was little probability of his gaining the honor of a bullet or a bayonet 
through him, which under other circumstances she would be willing to bestow, 
beckoned him aside. 

" Did you receive a warning to train %" asked the captain. 

" Yes, Sir," replied Van Rensselaer, giving his name and residence. 

"Ah ! yes," said the other, " I remember. But there-is some mistake." 

" None at all, Sir ; I have the notice in my pocket." 

" Hem ! yes. But you are not obliged to train." 

"Oh! I know that, "Sir 
State in any capacity." 

" Oh ! no doubt, no doubt. But— but— the fact is, the laws do not oblige col- 
ored men to do military duty." 

" Very true, Sir; but is there any law against if?" 

" No— not e-x-a-c-t-1-y. But — " 

" Very well, Sir, I choose to train. I have received your notice, and here I 
am, all ready for service. The law doesn't oblige me to train, — neither does it 
prohibit me. I prefer to do it." 

u Yes, I see, I see. But I will excuse you." 

" I don't want to be excused, Sir." 

" Well, I had rat-her excuse you." 

" You are very kind ; but I hav'nt the slightest objection to training. It 
wont take us a great while, will it, Sir V 

" Oh ! it will take us an hour or so," 

" Well, Sir, I'll train. I can spare the time. 

" But I don't want vou to." 

" But I had rather.'" 

11 Well, I insist—" 

" That I must not ? 

"Yes." 

" You won't let me V 

" No." 



So private Van Rensselaer having carried his point, of being denied the pri- 
vilege of making a fool of himself according to statute, because he was colored, 
[shouldered his musket, gave his unwilling commander a military salute, and 
| marched off the field with the honors of war. The redoubtable captain reliev- 
; ed his bosom by a heavy sigh of his pent-up emotion, and as he wiped the cold 
j sweat from his brow, thanked God that he was delivered from the most dan- 
gerous foe that in all his military experience he had ever encountered. 

[Nat. Anti-Slavery Standard 

From the National Anti Slavery Standard. 
A TRUE STORY. 
People are apt to say, " What have children to do with Slavery 1" I think 
they have much to do with it ; children are the great sufferers from Slavery ; 
the precious days when free children are receiving instruction, are all lost to 
the children of slaves ; when free children are treasuring up beautiful recollec- 
tions, and great thoughts, and a fund of happiness that spreads itself over the whole 
of after-life, the little slave in its best estate is living like a little well-fed brute, 
happy, if it is allowed, like the brute, to grow up by the side of its mother. All 
children should know and think of these things, that they may do what they can 
for these poor little prisoners ; and they may do much, if their hearts are en- 
gaged in the work. I heard a little anecdote the other day which showed how 
much a child can do for her parent, simply by expressing her native sense of 
justice and right to him. 

Mrs. F. was relating to me some of her experiences while she and her hus- 
band had been lecturing in a town somewhere in the West, where the people 
had thought very little upon the subject of Slavery, but who seemed deeply in- 
terested as soon as it was fairly presented to them, as it was by their faithful 
words. She said that they were one evening at a party of friends who were 
desirous of hearing what they had to say upon ihe subject of Slavery, and that 
among others, a gentleman and his little daughter were there. A more than 
common affection existed between this child and her father. He sang beauti- 
fully, and his little daughter always accompanied him very sweetly, and it was 
a very pleasant thing to see them together. She had an uncommonly fine face, 
and when she looked up at her father, reverence and love spoke trom every 
feature. His tenderness and devotion to her were equally striking. 

Mrs. F. was much interested in this father, and his daughter. He was a 
practising lawyer in the town in which he lived. She had conversed much 
with him, and had plead the cause of justice and humanity, most earnestly with 
him, and, as we shall see, not without producing a deep impression. On this 
evening, after he and his daughter had been singing together, Mrs. F. called the 
little girl to her, and took her up in her lap. 

" You are a very happy child," said she, "you and your father love one an- 
other very dearly, do you not V 

" Oh, yes," said the child, " that we do." 
" And you love to be always with him, do you not 1" 
" Oh, yes, indeed," she replied. 

"It is, 1 believe, the will of the good God, that children should love their pa- 
rents and live happily with them. What should you think of men who should 
take children away from their parents, and sell them for money to strangers, 
who may do what they will with them, and who carry them away where they 
will never know father or mother again, and where they are often treated with 
cruelty V 

" No one can be so wicked ; no man would take children from their parents 
and sell them ; it cannot be," exclaimed the child,—" it would be too cruel." 

" But this is true," said Mrs. F. " There are such wicked men, and many 
men, who call themselves good, do this, and the law of this country allows it." 
" But they are very wicked men, and the law is a wicked law," said the lit- 
tle girl; and she looked down thoughtfully, and as if she felt very sorrowful. 
at last she said, " My father would not sell a child, nor let anybody else do such 
a wickedness, if he knew it. But he never told me of this." 



" But your father knows that these wicked things are done," said Mrs. F. ; 
| " and he has sworn to maintain and obey the laws that give men the power to 
! commit these cruelties." 

I "My father!" exclaimed the little girl, with great indignation, "my father 
| have anything to do with such wicked laws ! he swear to support a law to sell 
I children, and take them from their fathers ! I don't believe it ; my father would 
never do such a tiling. I know it is not so." 

" I think it is so, my dear," said Mrs. F. " and I think that he himself will 
not deny it." 

The little girl darted away to her father, and standing up very erect before 
him, her face glowing from excitement — she said aloud to him*: " Father do 
you help to support laws that give wicked men the right to take children away 
from their fathers and mothers, and sell them 1 " 

There was a large company in the room, the child was unconscious of the 
presence of any one, and it was a moving sight to see her, as she stood up be- 
fore her idolized father, waiting his reply : her face was flushed, her figure 
looked taller than usual, there was something in her tone of voice that repelled 
the thought of the possibility that he would plead guilty to the charge. She 
stood there evidently not as his accuser, but as the jealous vindicator of his 
honor. 

Her father looked at her for a moment without speaking a word, and then 
with a firm but sorrowful tone, he replied, " I am afraid my child, I have done 
this thing." 

The little girl made no answer. Her dilated form seemed to shrink again 
into the size of a child ; her eyes, which were fixed on his face, were cast down 
upon the floor ; she uttered no word, but she turned away from him. Suddenly 
| the fine gold had become dim in her eyes, a cloud had come over her heaven, 
I her young heart was very heavy. 

Her father never forgot this moment, nor the gentle, but heart-piercing rebuke 
; of her silence, of her averted face. He withdrew his promise of allegiance to 
j laws which sanctioned and commanded crime, and so was reconciled to the 
j angelic teacher in his child. Thenceforward he resolved to maintain himself 
and his family by some honest occupation, and he took for the motto of his 
moral life, " no compromise with sin," of his political, " no union with slave- 
1 holders." E. L. F. 



Neither men, nor governments, have a right to sell those of their own species. 
, Men and their liberties are neither purchaseable nor saleable. 

He, who supports the system of slavery, is the enemy of the whole human 
race. He divides it into two societies of legal assassins ; the oppressors and 
the oppressed. It is the same thing as proclaiming to the world, if" you would 
preserve your life, instantly take away mine for I want to have yours. 

ABBE RAYNAL. 



"WHAT'S THE USE?" 

" What's tlie use of abusing the church ? It is slavery that you 
pretend to hate. Why, then point yonr guns at something else ?" 

When my neighbor Wish- well asked me these questions, I thought 
he had not as much causality (as the phrenologists call common 
sense), as would enable him to " go in when it rains,"—" make hay 
when the sun shines," or " luff when it blows." 

By way of reply, I asked him a few questions, as the least offensive 
way of communicating the requisite information. 

" What's the difficulty ?" I said, " in the way of abolishing slavery ?' 
" Is it not that the whole nation pretend that it is not wrong to hold 
slaves ?" 

" Yes, that's the difficulty f" 



" Who pretends to be the moral light of the world, the salt of the 
earth, the leaven that is to change its evil to good} the authority on 
all questions of right and wrong ?" 

" Why the church, to be surer" 

" And what does she decide to be right on the question of slavery ? 
Does she not say that God ordained it ; that man's circumstances re- 
quire it ; that the Bible justifies it ; that the patriarchs practised it ; 
that Christ allowed it ; that it is better to continue it still longer than 
to abolish it i And does she not welcome slaveholders to her com- 
munion and excommunicate abolitionists T" 

" Yes, it is true she does." 

" What then remains for them to do, but to change her course, or 
destroy her character ?" 

[No answer.] 

" Suppose they try the first alternative. How are they to change 
the opinions and conduct of her members. Is there any other way | 
than to show that emancipation is right, good, safe ; and that slavery; 
is wrong, evil, unsafe ? to point the true way, immediate repentance 
of the sin, and if the men will not walk in it, to blame them ? Is it 
abuse to say of a slaveholding church that it is rich like Babylon of 
old, not in good deeds, but in slaves and the souls of men. ■ Come 
out of her, lest ye be tormented with her plagues ?' ' Woe unto ! 
them that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter, evil for good, and 
good for evil ?" It is not abuse, it is blame ; and the church is to 
blame." 

" Well, I can't bear to hear the church of the dear Redeemer, for 
which he shed his blood, blamed. It injures the cause of religion." 

" And J cannot bear to have the lowest and most suffering portion 
of the community, whom Christ has chosen as his peculiar represen- 
tatives, saying, ' inasmuch as ye do good or evil to the least of these 
my brethren, ye have done it unto me.' / cannot bear, I say, to 
have them bought and sold, and flogged, and branded, and denied 
the Bible and the best hopes of the life to come. It is as broad as 
it is long, •' and a little broader, I guess,' this way of yours of screen- 
ing sin for the sake of religion. It is as broad as the road to de- 
struction." 

" Well I guess I love the cause of the poor bleeding slave as much 
as anybody; but I cannot bear to see the church divided; I only 
want to see her purified. I must go with the church of the dear Re- 
deemer." 

«« What ! right or wrong ? I can't agree with you, neighbor Wish- 
well. If she will hold slaves, I must go with the dear Redeemer ! 
himself, his principles and his laws, against the church that calls 
herself his, while she outrages all these in the person of the slave. I 
am ready to brand the man as auti-christian and pro-slavery, who 
refuses to follow the truth of God, even though it lead him out of a 
corrupt church. Men may talk much and well about the poor bleed- 
j ing slave ; I only look to see in which scale their weight is felt, 
whether in is favor or his master's. 

" If you, instead of talking about the poor bleeding slave, were feel- 
ing for those in bonds as bound with them, I should see your guns 
too, pointed against the church." Maru w> Chapman> 



{Prom tlie Boston Couriers 

Mister Eddyter ^-Our Hosea was down to Bosting last Week* and he see 
a cruetin' Sarjunt a struttin' round as pop'ler as- a hen with 1 chieking> with 2 
fellers a drummin ; and fifin' arter him like all nater, the sarjunt he thout hosea, 
hechVt gut his i teeth cut cos he looked a kinder's though he'd jest com down, so 
he kalkalated to hook him in, but hosy wood 't take none o* his sarse fcr.all he 
hed much as 20 Rooster's tales stuck outer his hat and eenamost enuf brass a 
bobbin' up and down on his shoulders and figureed outer his coat and trousis, 
let alone what nater hed sot in his featers, to make a 6 pounder out on. 

Wat, Hosea he cum home considerable riled, and arter Fd gone to bed I hearn 
Him a thrashin' round like a shorMailed Bull in nl time, the old Woman ses 
she to me, ses she, Zekle, ses she, otir hosee's gut the chollery or suthin anuther, 
j ses she, don't you Bee skeered, ses I, he's oney amakin' pottery) ses i, he's oilers 
on hand at that ere busyneslike Da &c martin, and shure enuf cum mornin Hosy he 
cum down stares full chizzle hare on eend and cote tales fly in' and sot rite of to 
go reed his varses to Parson 'Wilbur bein he haint aney grate shows o'book 
larnin himself, bimeby he cum back and sed the parson was dreadful tickled 
with 'em as i hoop you wil Be, and said Ihey wus True grit. 

Hosea ses taint hardly fair to call 'em hisn now, cos the parson kinder slicked 
off sum o' the last varses, but he told Hosee he didn't want to put his ore in to 
tech to the Rest on em, bein they wus very well As thay was, and then Hosy 
ses he sed suthin a nuther about Simplex Mundishes or sum sutch feller, but I 
guess Hosea kinder didn't hear him, for I never hearn o' nobody o' that name 
in this villadge, and I've lived here man and boy 76 years cum next tater dig- 
gin, and thair aint no wheres a kittin spryer 'n I be. 

(but Hosea ses he's willin' to make his after david that he sed so.) 

If you print 'em I wish vou'd jest let folks know who hosy's father is, cos mi 
ant Keziah used to say it's nater to be curus, ses .she, she_ aint livinjdiough and 
he's a likely kinder lad. 

Thrash away, you'll have to rattle 

On them kittle drums o' yourn, — 
'Taint a knowin' kind o' cattle 

That is ketched with mouldy corn; 
Put in stiff, you fifer feller, 

Let folks see how spry you be, — 
Guess you'll toot till you are yeller, 

'Fore you git ahold o' me ! 



That ere flag's a leetle rotten, 

Hope it aint your Sunday's best ; — 
Fact ! it takes a sight of cotton 

To stuff out a soger's chest ; 
Sence we farmers have to pay for't, 

Ef ye must wear humps like these, 
Sposin' 3 r ou should try salt hay for't, 

It would do as slick as grease. 

'T wouldn't suit them southern fellers, 

They're a dreadful graspin' set, 
We must oilers. blow the bellers 

When they want their irons het ; 
May be it's all right as preachin', 

But my narves it kind o' grates, 
When I see the overreachin' 

O' them nigger-driven States. 

Them that rule us, them slave-traders, 
Haint they cut a thunderin' swarth, 

(Helped by Yankee renegaders) 
Through the vartu o' the North ! 



EZEKIL BIGELOW. 

We begin to think it's nater 

To take sarse and not be riled ; — 

Who'd expect to see a tater 
All on eend at bein' biled 7 

As for war, I call it murder. 

There you have it plain and flat ; 
I don't want to go no furder 

Than my Testyment for that ; 
God has said so plump and fairly, 

It's as long as it is broad, 
And you've got to get up airly 

Ef you want to take in God. 

'Taint your eppyletts and feathers, 

Make the thing a grain more right ; 
'Taint a follerin' your bell wethers 

Will excuse ye in His sight, 
Ef you take a sword and dror it, 

Aud should stick a feller through, 
Gov'ment aint to answer for it, 

God '11 send the bill to you. 

What's the use o' meetin-goin' 

Every Sabbath, wet or dry, 
Ef it's right to go a mowin' 

Fellow men like oats and rye 1 
I dunno but what it's pooty 

Trainin' round in bobtail coats, — 
But it's curus Christian dooty 

To be cuttin' folks's throats. 



They may talk of Freedom's airy 

Till they 're purple in the face, 
It's a grand great cemetary 

For the barth-rights of our race, 
They jest want this Califdrny 

So's to lug new slave-states in 
To abuse ye, and to scorn ye, 

And to plunder ye like sin, 

Ain't it cute to see a Yankee 
Take such everlastin' pains, 
. All to git the devil's thankee 

Helping on 'em weld their chains 1 
j Why, it's jest as clear as Aggers, 

Clear as one and one make twOj 
, Chaps that make black slaves o' niggers 
Want to make white slaves o' you. 

!Tell ye jest the eend I've come to 
Arter cipherin plaguy smart, 
And it makes a handy sum, too, 
Any gump could larn by heart ; 
Laborin' man and laborin' woman 
Have one glory and one shame, 
Everythin' that done inhuman 
Injers all on ye the same, * 

' 'Taint by turnin' out to hack folks. 
You're agoin' to git your right,

Is to make him fill his puss. 

Want to tackle vie in, do ye 1 
I expect you'll have to wait ;

You'll begin to kalkylate ;

Whether I'd be such a goose

She wants me for home consumption, 
Let alone the hay's to mow —

You've a darned long row to hoe.

Wal, go 'long to help 'emstealin' 

Bigger pens to cram with slaves, 
Help the men that's oilers dealin' 

Insults on your fathers' graves ; 
Help the strong to grind the feeble, 

Help the many agin the few, 
Help the men that call your people, 

Whitewashed slaves and peddlin' 



Massachusetts, God forgive her, 

She's a kneelin' Avith the rest, 
She, that ought to ha' clung for ever 

In her grand old eagle-nest ; 
She that oughter stand so fearless 

While the wracks are round her 
hurled, 
Holding up a beacon peerless 

To the oppressed of all the world ! 

Haint they sold your colored seamen 1 

Baint they made your envoys whiz 1 
What'll make ye act like freemen 1 

What'll git your dander riz 1 
Come, I'll tell ye what I'm thinkin' 

Is our dooty in this fix, 
They'd ha' done't as quick as winkin' 

In the days of Seventy-six. 

Clang the bells in every steeple, 

Call all true men to disown 
The traducers of our people, 

The enslavers of their own ; 
Let our dear old Bay State proudly 

Put the trumpet to her mouth, 
Let her ring this message loudly 

In the ears of all the South. 

" I'll return ye good for evil 

Much as we frail mortals can, 
But I wun't go help the devil 

Makin' man the cus of man ; 
Call me coward, call me traitor, 

Jest as suits your mean idees, 
Here I stand a tyrant hater, 

And the friend of God and peace !" 

If I'd my way I had rather 

We should go to work and part — 
They take one way, we take t'other — 

Guess it wouldn't break my heart ; 
Man had oughter put asunder 

Them that God has noways jined ; 
And I shouldn't greatly wonder 

If there's thousands o' my mind.
