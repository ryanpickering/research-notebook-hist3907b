WHOA!!! This seems really useful. Maybe I am just starstruck because I love data journalism and think it's the best, but this seems very powerful. 

This, coupled with analytics, adwords, etc., shows that Google does have great tools for online analysis that most people aren't aware of - remnants of their early days perhaps.

The stuff talked about in this video though - replacing bad text, grouping items, etc. - is all really useful, but I have a feeling that there is more to this program than just advanced find and replace. We will see in video 2!
