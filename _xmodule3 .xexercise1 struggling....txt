have been going over my transcription and encoding for almost an hour... i figured out that the majority of my tags were wrong and that i needed a ton of info i didn't have. i have it now though i think, so maybe i am good to go minus some semantic error my eyes are too tired to see.

i will leave this exercise for another day. on to exercise 2!
