types.....

TOPIC MODEL GUI
- java thing
- input and output, # of topics. incredibly easy to use. 
- two folders: html and csv files
- lets you jump between topics and documents
- tweak # of topics you want to think about, yadyadayada
- easiest way overall to do this 

- remember! no real meaning until the historian gives it to the data
- don't take answers at face value

BUT, MORE COMPLICATED THINGS? Other ways of representing connections b/w topics and docs?
- heatmaps
- barcharts
- bubblelines
- flowgraphs
- networks
- no one way to visualize - the correct way is the way to convey your story the best

MALLET!!!
- use it on the command line: macho 
RSTUDIO
- holy crow this is crazy
- lots to do, lots to see
- kind of got caught up in watching, not taking notes. therefore: look at another guide? exercises material? etc. etc.
	- being honest in my open notebook hehe
	- in fact it IS in the exercises! score
