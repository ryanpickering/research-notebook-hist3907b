there is a cultural force behind charts... they amplify truthiness by making us beleive them - sure that makes sense!

ie. x and y axis have to be fair, if you start your y axis at something convenient for your story, it looks convincing 
SO MANY INSANE LIES THROUGH CHARTS!

just add data and poof! you have truth. we are not criitcal of looking at graphs... if we collect enough data and chart it, there's no theory needed - just TRUTH AND FACTS (clearly not though) 

humanities need to realize lots of things. categories even have biases implicit right? especially in old document, etc. also in things just like, what constitutes a nation? gender? etc. 

make your visualization accessible! understood! use ugly labels to allow for understanding! wooooo!
