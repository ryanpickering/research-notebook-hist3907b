HERE WE GO

qualitative and quantitiative DATA
- we are uncomfortable w/ math
- quantifying historical data?
- 70s, cleometrics as baloney
- what do you do?.............

YOU COUNT EM - count the patterns that clusters of words make up. 
to find patterns...
- deform vision: find pattern out of words, etc. 
- do this with a computer.... relating all words in various combos in various order etc. 
- bigrams: 2 word clusters (number of words X (number of words - 1)) 
- out from that... trigrams, quadgrams, quintgrams, yada yada yada - LARGE NUMBERS
- not just words/frequency, but words/local neighbourhood, paragraph, page, chapter, book section, book, volume, series, etc etc etc
- gives us a real sense of discourse, ideas, discussions going on, etc. 
- with this, do a close reading with the patterns to discover things in human terms
