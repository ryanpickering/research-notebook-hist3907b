# Research notebook for HIST3907B

Hello! This is my open notebook. Feel free to explore what I have done throughout the course of HIST3907B. 

####A small guide to the notebook's organization...

- All notes of interest to a peruser of this notebook are preceded by a simple tag, formatted .x(blank) 
- Class notes are .xclass(number)
- Module exercises are .xmodule(number)
- Class notes and module notes sometimes are under both tags, since we cover module stuff in class a lot and vice versa. 
- Once in a while a to do list will pop up along this work... please ignore.
- Miscellaneous things are under a bunch of different tags...
  - More info on this as more misc. tags develop.

Enjoy!
