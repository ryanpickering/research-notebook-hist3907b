what the hell are metrics........
its really an ALGORITHM producing numerical output to do... SOMETHING

so i guess metrics allow us to see that an algorithm 

small world networks: looks random but is behaving organized
	- central characters key to functioning of network

path length, how information flows. who is closest to the shortest paths of characters? *6 degrees of separation kind of stuff...
	- whoever sits at intersection of most people. this isnt the whole story though - we can connect everyone eventually

clustering: metapatterning of this is important
	- clustering algorithms look at links (dyads) to determine this
	- degree centality: the more connections you have the more central you are
	- closeness centrality: number of steps to the outer edge of the network? not a very popular metric
	- betweenness centrality: who each short path goes through to get to every other node
	- in the same network, different metrics give a different centrality each time. very cool! why use which one though?
	
directed or undirected networks are essential to know as well: different centrality based off those relationships.
