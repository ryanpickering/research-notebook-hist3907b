first reading: goes over what we spoke about in class, that subtle differences in font are important for meaning. recognizing differences in fonts and intended uses for said fonts is important in any visualization. COOL

typeconnection: played along in class when we were talking about this. going to do it again... ugh this game really makes me want to buy beautiful fonts like this! It looks like the trend is to pair a serif with a sans serif that are around the same height with a slight difference in weight? Cool - I will incorporate this into my own work!
