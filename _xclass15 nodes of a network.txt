lots of sins committed under the term 'network analysis'

nodes can be anything - no connections
edges - connecting nodes, making a relationship. 

visualization of a network =/= analysis of a network: anyone can plop data into network visualization

so, nodes and edges... we can expand upon that.
nodes can have attributes: information about them perhaps
connections (edges, oops) can be weighted differently as well

kinds of edges: 
DYADS - regular
a dyad where the relationship is reciprocated
transivity - if a is connected to b and c, b and c will also be connected
	- implications of this? good relationship, bad, etc? WHAT IF
