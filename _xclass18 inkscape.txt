i already have this from my coupon days! hallelujah!

use inkscape to break up elements of pdf's and move em around!

exercise is to turn an ugly pdf chart into something beautiful
humanists can mess with charts and "data" like this to highlgiht things because we are not bound by scientific rhetoric
