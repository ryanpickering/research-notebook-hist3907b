i have added nothing but my transcription - something in it is wrecking the code so as to make it not show up!!! noooooooo! 

i even copied my transcription out from the body tags and pasted it back into a blanktemplate, just in case i accidentally broke something while i was working on it. yikes! nothing stilL!

this is not what i wanted to happen tonight! i will take another look at this tomorrow. for now, i will mess around on exercise two.
