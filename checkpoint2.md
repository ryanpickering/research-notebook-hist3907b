###Checkpoint 2

Hello! Here is a quick update on my status thus far on my final project.
- I have downloaded several .csv's of Google Trends data on search patterns regarding residential schools through their built in download method. 
  - With that, I have examined the data and noticed really interesting things: where certain terms are used in Canada versus where they are not, where the majority of searches are taking place, etc. This new discovery is leading me in the direction of examining trends in search history in the prairies and what it might correspond to. 
- I have downloaded all of the Reddit data from Mark Allen Thornton's piece that he made available on his page. Right now my computer is unable to handle even opening one of those files... so my plan right now is to put the information on my external harddrive and look at it this week at school, maybe on one of the Underhill Research Room computers. 
- I have not gotten around to using twarc to download tweets relating to the residential schools yet, and I am starting to sense that that may not be the best place to look for good history. Nevertheless, I will be looking for tweets in there soon enough.
- What I hope to find right now is regional differences on how different provinces view a) the residential schools question/apology, b) the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and c) Indigenous issues in general, illuminated through search patterns. Juxtaposed with other information (from news at the time, where people were going with these searches, etc.) I hope to determine whether such searches are rooted in a desire to dispel prejudice or strengthen it. 

I'm really enjoying my first few steps into this material (though I should have dealt with this stuff quite awhile ago). I am excited to begin to visualize the information that Google Trends is giving me in Palladio or something - that is another thing I will have to examine further.
