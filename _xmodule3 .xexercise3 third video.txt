street address to lat-long... wow! open refine can reach out to the internet to change things in our data. Interesting, this has many many applications i'm sure.

Still not certain on the concept of json even though we discussed it last week...

remember APIs? needed in some websites when bringing them into open refine - something to keep in mind.
