initial point of discovery: came into this thinking there would be a big reaction to the apology by harper re: residential schools, and people would be talking about it, searching about it, learning more from that

BUT! data from google analytics is showing a bigger spike in learning about residential schools lately... perhaps from idle no more?

RESISTANCE is generating more discussion and learning than the GOVERNMENT addressing the issue! wow!
