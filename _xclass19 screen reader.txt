helps people without sight, but disables a person WITH good sight! interesting thing to consider. reflects screen essentialism and the bias we put on screen as the medium. what about sound, etc.?

ie. hearing the past. what avenues have we closed off by not engaging with universal design? changes the message? etc. 
are there patterns in the data we are analyzing that make sense to engage with through sound? will patterns come out if we engage with the data through sound? what is making the pattern? etc. etc. implications of all this can make neat stuff

universal design and open access go hand in hand!!!
