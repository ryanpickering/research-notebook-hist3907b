lynda.com video... primary vs secondary vs tertiary colours. simple stuff so far, i understand that. 
3 rules: 
conplementary (across the colour wheel), 
analagous (the two colours beside the one colour), 
triad (3 colours 120 degress apart on colour wheel: best method?)

colour swatches... 
hue tint tone and shade: what do they mean?
hue: 12 purest colours on colour wheel
tint: lightening the colour (pastel) w/ white
tone: neutralize colour by adding grey
shade: darken the colour w/ black

effective colour contrast: the main point being to contrast light and dark , and use complementary/triad colour schemes, NOT analogous.
