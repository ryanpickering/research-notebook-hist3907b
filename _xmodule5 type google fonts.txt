wow, there are a ton of fonts here. a lot look very very alike, but some stick out to me as ones I would really like to use!

I can't think of a specific kind of font that might be appropriate for my final project re: residential schools and awareness in canada... something very serious perhaps. its taken me a long time to decide between merriweather and brawler for my serif font, but i chose brawler. for my sans serif i chose lato, one of the most popular ones according to google. 

whoa! easy way to incorporate the font into any page - very cool feature. now to put the rest of the exercise to work.
