term frequency inverse document/distribution frequency
tf-idf
- strips out stop words in documents, then counts what remains - lists, vectors. 
- compares every pair of documents, multiplying frequencies of corresponding words
- then visualizes it in weird ways. 

no probablility involved: just a bunch of math and pushing together. 

- folders of the nested term list- they nest and do cool things. 
- find things you might have missed!!!!
- impose quick order using overview and guide reading like that. 

can be hotsed on your own comp., difficultly, but doable for high-security info. the servers for it are hosted in USA.

cool visualizations... tag your stuff in overview and export w/ tags. make charts in a spreadsheet with it yourself!
