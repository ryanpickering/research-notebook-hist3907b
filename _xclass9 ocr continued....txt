problems with it, and relevant: we as historians do transcriptions on our own ie. hist2809b
- we were supposed to lay it out objectively, etc. 

BUT! transcription vs. text-encoding
to make these transcriptions useful in other ways/use the web's power, must tell the computer SEMANTIC MEANING of text.
make linkages to other databases, other documents, etc. 

basic html: a kind of visual encoding (bold, italics, etc.) 
***html is related to... XML: create own tags and use them to communicate whatever info you want!
to link together terms, people who are the same, label things in a way that the computer understand
close reading!!! footnoting kind of, labels and links things

bring in stylesheets (xlst) on xml just as html is styled by css
